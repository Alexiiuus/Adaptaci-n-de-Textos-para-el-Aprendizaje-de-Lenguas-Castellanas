And, then, there is the isolation \\u2013 being in the 1%, it turns out, can be lonely.\\u201d It seems F Scott Fitzgerald was right: the very rich \\u201care different from you and me\\u201d. \\nCounsellors argue things have become worse since the financial crisis and the debate over income inequality that has been spurred on by movements like Occupy Wall Street and the Fight for $15 fair wage campaign. \\n\\u201cThe Occupy Wall Street movement was a good one and had some important things to say about income inequality but it singled out the 1% and painted them globally as something negative,\\u201d said Jamie Traeger-Muney, a wealth psychologist and founder of the Wealth Legacy Group. The media, she said, is partly to blame for making the rich \\u201cfeel like they need to hide or feel ashamed\\u201d. \\n\\u201cSometimes, I am shocked by things that people say. You would never refer to another group of people in the way that it seems perfectly normal to refer to wealth holders.\\u201d \\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s really isolating to have a lot of money. People\\u2019s reactions to you can be scary,\\u201d said Barbara Nusbaum, an expert in money psychology. \\u201cWe are all taught not to talk about money. It\\u2019s not polite to talk about money. Ironically, it\\u2019s harder to talk about having money than it is to talk about not having money. It\\u2019s much more socially acceptable to say 'I am broke. Things are hard.' You can\\u2019t say 'I have a ton of money.' You have to keep a lot of your life private.\\u201d \\nAs a result, Cockrell points out, the rich tend to hang out with other rich Americans, not out of snobbery but in order to be around those who understand them and their problems. \\nThe growing gap between the rich and poor is a global phenomenon. According to Oxfam, the richest 1% have seen their share of global wealth increase from 44% in 2009 to 48% in 2014 and are on track to own more than the other 99% by 2016. \\nIn the US, over the last three decades, the wealth owned by the top 0.1% households increased from 7% to 22% even as the wealth of the bottom 90% of households declined. \\nThe number of extremely wealthy people has also been climbing. According to research from Spectrem Group, in 2014, the number of US households with $1m or more in assets \\u2013 excluding the value of their primary home \\u2013 increased by 500,000 to 10.1m. In 2007, that number was 9.2m. Households worth $5m or more reached 1.3m and 142,000 households are now worth $25m or more. \\nSince the 2008 financial crisis, the income gap has expanded and the situation \\u201chas gotten worse for the wealthy\\u201d, Cockrell said. The main reason? Not knowing if your friends are friends with you or your money. \\n\\u201cSomeone else who is also a billionaire \\u2013 they don\\u2019t want anything from you. Never being able to trust your friendships with people of different means, I think that is difficult,\\u201d said Cockrell. \\u201cAs the gap has widened, the rich have become more and more isolated.\\u201d \\nThese are real fears faced by the richest of the rich. In 2007, the Gates Foundation teamed up with Boston College\\u2019s Center on Wealth and Philanthropy to document what it felt like to be in America\\u2019s 1%. For the next four years, researchers surveyed 165 of America\\u2019s richest households \\u2013 120 of those households have at least $25m in assets. The average net worth of those surveyed was $78m. The resulting study, The Joys and Dilemmas of Wealth, was 500 pages long and seemed to prove the old adage that money can\\u2019t buy happiness. \\n\\u201cWealth can be a barrier to connecting with other people,\\u201d confessed a spouse of a tech entrepreneur who made about $80m. Some Americans have taken to keeping their wealth secret. \\u201cWe talk about it as stealth wealth. There are a lot of people that are hiding their wealth because they are concerned about negative judgment,\\u201d said Traeger-Muney. If wealthy Americans talk about the unique challenges that come with their wealth, people often dismiss their experience. \\n\\u201cPeople say 'Oh, poor you.' There is not a lot of sympathy there,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWealth is still one of our last taboos.\\u201d \\nSpeaking in his soft, soothing voice that makes you want to spill all your worries, Cockrell said that a common mistake that many of his wealthy clients make is letting their money define them. \\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s healthy to discount your problems. If you are part of the 1%, you still have problems and they are legitimate to you. Even when you say, 'I don\\u2019t have to struggle for money', there are other parts of your life. Money is not the only thing that defines you,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYour problems are legitimate.\\u201d\\n\",\n          \"If you think of the jobs robots could never do, you would probably put doctors and teachers at the top of the list. It's easy to imagine robot cleaners and factory workers, but some jobs need human connection and creativity. But are we underestimating what robots can do? In some cases, they already perform better than doctors at diagnosing illness. Also, some patients might feel more comfortable sharing personal information with a machine than a person. Could there be a place for robots in education after all?\\nBritish education expert Anthony Seldon thinks so. And he even has a date for the robot takeover of the classroom: 2027. He predicts robots will do the main job of transferring information and teachers will be like assistants. Intelligent robots will read students' faces, movements and maybe even brain signals. Then they will adapt the information to each student. It's not a popular opinion and it's unlikely robots will ever have empathy and the ability to really connect with humans like another human can.\\nOne thing is certain, though. A robot teacher is better than no teacher at all. In some parts of the world, there aren't enough teachers and 9\\u201316 per cent of children under the age of 14 don't go to school. That problem could be partly solved by robots because they can teach anywhere and won't get stressed, or tired, or move somewhere for an easier, higher-paid job.\\nThose negative aspects of teaching are something everyone agrees on. Teachers all over the world are leaving because it is a difficult job and they feel overworked. Perhaps the question is not 'Will robots replace teachers?' but 'How can robots help teachers?' Office workers can use software to do things like organise and answer emails, arrange meetings and update calendars. Teachers waste a lot of time doing non-teaching work, including more than 11 hours a week marking homework. If robots could cut the time teachers spend marking homework and writing reports, teachers would have more time and energy for the parts of the job humans do best.\",\n          \"In the philosophy of religion, creation is the action by which God brings an object into existence, while conservation is the action by which God maintains the existence of an object over time. The major monotheisms unambiguously affirm that God both created the world and conserves it. It is less clear, however, whether creation and conservation are to be conceived as distinct kinds of actions. The question has its roots in medieval and early modern characterizations of divine action, and it has received renewed attention in recent decades.\\nOn the predominant traditional view, conservation is continuous creation. Adherents of this view typically say with Francisco Su\\u00e1rez that God\\u2019s creation and conservation of things are \\u201conly conceptually distinct\\u201d (Su\\u00e1rez 1597, 120). Jonathan Edwards, for example, says, \\u201cGod\\u2019s upholding created substance, or causing its existence in each successive moment, is altogether equivalent to an immediate production out of nothing, at each moment\\u2026. So that this effect differs not at all from the first creation, but only circumstantially\\u2026\\u201d (Edwards 1758, 402; emphasis in the original). In other words, there is no real difference between the act of creation and the act of conservation, though different words may be used for them. Descartes, Malebranche, Leibniz, and Berkeley all express similar views. More recently, Philip Quinn likewise treats both God\\u2019s creating and God\\u2019s conserving as species of bringing about a thing\\u2019s existence. We call the act \\u2018creation\\u2019 if it occurs at the first time at which the creature exists, and we call it \\u2018conservation\\u2019 if it occurs at a later time, but the action is the same (e.g., Quinn 1988, 54).\\nThe alternative to this view is that the act of conserving beings that already exist differs from calling beings into existence from nothing. Some argue that each persisting creature plays a causal role in its ongoing existence, so that God is not the sole agent as in an ex nihilo creation. Some also argue that conservation must be an ongoing act, whereas creation occurs at an instant.\\nA large part of what is at stake in the debate is the relationship between divine action and creaturely action. Continuous creation theorists may reject a distinction between creation and conservation as an attempt to attribute a divine prerogative to created things. On the other hand, those who endorse a distinction may regard continuous creation theory as (to borrow a phrase) \\u201cone of those high-minded philosophical depreciations of God\\u2019s works that come disguised as compliments to God\\u2019s person\\u201d (van Inwagen 1988, 46 n4). The debate also raises a number of interesting questions about causation, time, and their relations.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"B2\",\n          \"A2\",\n          \"C2\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":5}]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"metadata":{"id":"2rRT33gXYjnL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1730979229246,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":314,"user":{"displayName":"PREMA NARAYAN OCHOA","userId":"11814823530760124735"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# Rename\n","df = df.rename(columns={\"label\": \"level\"})"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":423},"id":"h0bThoIZZ-KZ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1730979293652,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":331,"user":{"displayName":"PREMA NARAYAN OCHOA","userId":"11814823530760124735"}},"outputId":"a6747e3b-0d64-46d2-8934-c9cefb3646f2"},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                   text level  \\\n","0     Hi!\\nI've been meaning to write for ages and f...

But they are. A lot of therapists do not give enough weight to their issues.\\u201d \\nSo, what issues are America\\u2019s 1% struggling with? \\u201cThere is guilt over being rich in the first place,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThere is the feeling that they have to hide the fact that they are rich. And, then, there is the isolation \\u2013 being in the 1%, it turns out, can be lonely.\\u201d It seems F Scott Fitzgerald was right: the very rich \\u201care different from you and me\\u201d. \\nCounsellors argue things have become worse since the financial crisis and the debate over income inequality that has been spurred on by movements like Occupy Wall Street and the Fight for $15 fair wage campaign. \\n\\u201cThe Occupy Wall Street movement was a good one and had some important things to say about income inequality but it singled out the 1% and painted them globally as something negative,\\u201d said Jamie Traeger-Muney, a wealth psychologist and founder of the Wealth Legacy Group. The media, she said, is partly to blame for making the rich \\u201cfeel like they need to hide or feel ashamed\\u201d. \\n\\u201cSometimes, I am shocked by things that people say. You would never refer to another group of people in the way that it seems perfectly normal to refer to wealth holders.\\u201d \\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s really isolating to have a lot of money. People\\u2019s reactions to you can be scary,\\u201d said Barbara Nusbaum, an expert in money psychology. \\u201cWe are all taught not to talk about money. It\\u2019s not polite to talk about money. Ironically, it\\u2019s harder to talk about having money than it is to talk about not having money. It\\u2019s much more socially acceptable to say 'I am broke. Things are hard.' You can\\u2019t say 'I have a ton of money.' You have to keep a lot of your life private.\\u201d \\nAs a result, Cockrell points out, the rich tend to hang out with other rich Americans, not out of snobbery but in order to be around those who understand them and their problems. \\nThe growing gap between the rich and poor is a global phenomenon. According to Oxfam, the richest 1% have seen their share of global wealth increase from 44% in 2009 to 48% in 2014 and are on track to own more than the other 99% by 2016. \\nIn the US, over the last three decades, the wealth owned by the top 0.1% households increased from 7% to 22% even as the wealth of the bottom 90% of households declined. \\nThe number of extremely wealthy people has also been climbing. According to research from Spectrem Group, in 2014, the number of US households with $1m or more in assets \\u2013 excluding the value of their primary home \\u2013 increased by 500,000 to 10.1m. In 2007, that number was 9.2m. Households worth $5m or more reached 1.3m and 142,000 households are now worth $25m or more. \\nSince the 2008 financial crisis, the income gap has expanded and the situation \\u201chas gotten worse for the wealthy\\u201d, Cockrell said. The main reason? Not knowing if your friends are friends with you or your money. \\n\\u201cSomeone else who is also a billionaire \\u2013 they don\\u2019t want anything from you. Never being able to trust your friendships with people of different means, I think that is difficult,\\u201d said Cockrell. \\u201cAs the gap has widened, the rich have become more and more isolated.\\u201d \\nThese are real fears faced by the richest of the rich. In 2007, the Gates Foundation teamed up with Boston College\\u2019s Center on Wealth and Philanthropy to document what it felt like to be in America\\u2019s 1%. For the next four years, researchers surveyed 165 of America\\u2019s richest households \\u2013 120 of those households have at least $25m in assets. The average net worth of those surveyed was $78m. The resulting study, The Joys and Dilemmas of Wealth, was 500 pages long and seemed to prove the old adage that money can\\u2019t buy happiness. \\n\\u201cWealth can be a barrier to connecting with other people,\\u201d confessed a spouse of a tech entrepreneur who made about $80m. Some Americans have taken to keeping their wealth secret. \\u201cWe talk about it as stealth wealth. There are a lot of people that are hiding their wealth because they are concerned about negative judgment,\\u201d said Traeger-Muney. If wealthy Americans talk about the unique challenges that come with their wealth, people often dismiss their experience. \\n\\u201cPeople say 'Oh, poor you.' There is not a lot of sympathy there,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWealth is still one of our last taboos.\\u201d \\nSpeaking in his soft, soothing voice that makes you want to spill all your worries, Cockrell said that a common mistake that many of his wealthy clients make is letting their money define them. \\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s healthy to discount your problems. If you are part of the 1%, you still have problems and they are legitimate to you. Even when you say, 'I don\\u2019t have to struggle for money', there are other parts of your life. Money is not the only thing that defines you,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYour problems are legitimate.\\u201d\\n\",\n          \"If you think of the jobs robots could never do, you would probably put doctors and teachers at the top of the list. It's easy to imagine robot cleaners and factory workers, but some jobs need human connection and creativity. But are we underestimating what robots can do? In some cases, they already perform better than doctors at diagnosing illness. Also, some patients might feel more comfortable sharing personal information with a machine than a person. Could there be a place for robots in education after all?\\nBritish education expert Anthony Seldon thinks so. And he even has a date for the robot takeover of the classroom: 2027. He predicts robots will do the main job of transferring information and teachers will be like assistants. Intelligent robots will read students' faces, movements and maybe even brain signals. Then they will adapt the information to each student. It's not a popular opinion and it's unlikely robots will ever have empathy and the ability to really connect with humans like another human can.\\nOne thing is certain, though. A robot teacher is better than no teacher at all. In some parts of the world, there aren't enough teachers and 9\\u201316 per cent of children under the age of 14 don't go to school. That problem could be partly solved by robots because they can teach anywhere and won't get stressed, or tired, or move somewhere for an easier, higher-paid job.\\nThose negative aspects of teaching are something everyone agrees on. Teachers all over the world are leaving because it is a difficult job and they feel overworked. Perhaps the question is not 'Will robots replace teachers?' but 'How can robots help teachers?' Office workers can use software to do things like organise and answer emails, arrange meetings and update calendars. Teachers waste a lot of time doing non-teaching work, including more than 11 hours a week marking homework. If robots could cut the time teachers spend marking homework and writing reports, teachers would have more time and energy for the parts of the job humans do best.\",\n          \"In the philosophy of religion, creation is the action by which God brings an object into existence, while conservation is the action by which God maintains the existence of an object over time. The major monotheisms unambiguously affirm that God both created the world and conserves it. It is less clear, however, whether creation and conservation are to be conceived as distinct kinds of actions. The question has its roots in medieval and early modern characterizations of divine action, and it has received renewed attention in recent decades.\\nOn the predominant traditional view, conservation is continuous creation. Adherents of this view typically say with Francisco Su\\u00e1rez that God\\u2019s creation and conservation of things are \\u201conly conceptually distinct\\u201d (Su\\u00e1rez 1597, 120). Jonathan Edwards, for example, says, \\u201cGod\\u2019s upholding created substance, or causing its existence in each successive moment, is altogether equivalent to an immediate production out of nothing, at each moment\\u2026. So that this effect differs not at all from the first creation, but only circumstantially\\u2026\\u201d (Edwards 1758, 402; emphasis in the original). In other words, there is no real difference between the act of creation and the act of conservation, though different words may be used for them. Descartes, Malebranche, Leibniz, and Berkeley all express similar views. More recently, Philip Quinn likewise treats both God\\u2019s creating and God\\u2019s conserving as species of bringing about a thing\\u2019s existence. We call the act \\u2018creation\\u2019 if it occurs at the first time at which the creature exists, and we call it \\u2018conservation\\u2019 if it occurs at a later time, but the action is the same (e.g., Quinn 1988, 54).\\nThe alternative to this view is that the act of conserving beings that already exist differs from calling beings into existence from nothing. Some argue that each persisting creature plays a causal role in its ongoing existence, so that God is not the sole agent as in an ex nihilo creation. Some also argue that conservation must be an ongoing act, whereas creation occurs at an instant.\\nA large part of what is at stake in the debate is the relationship between divine action and creaturely action. Continuous creation theorists may reject a distinction between creation and conservation as an attempt to attribute a divine prerogative to created things. On the other hand, those who endorse a distinction may regard continuous creation theory as (to borrow a phrase) \\u201cone of those high-minded philosophical depreciations of God\\u2019s works that come disguised as compliments to God\\u2019s person\\u201d (van Inwagen 1988, 46 n4). The debate also raises a number of interesting questions about causation, time, and their relations.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"level\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"B2\",\n          \"A2\",\n          \"C2\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1493,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Clay Cockrell is sitting in his office at Columbus Circle, across the street from 1 Central Park West, which houses Trump International Hotel and Tower.

In 2007, the Gates Foundation teamed up with Boston College\\u2019s Center on Wealth and Philanthropy to document what it felt like to be in America\\u2019s 1%. For the next four years, researchers surveyed 165 of America\\u2019s richest households \\u2013 120 of those households have at least $25m in assets. The average net worth of those surveyed was $78m. The resulting study, The Joys and Dilemmas of Wealth, was 500 pages long and seemed to prove the old adage that money can\\u2019t buy happiness. \\n\\u201cWealth can be a barrier to connecting with other people,\\u201d confessed a spouse of a tech entrepreneur who made about $80m. Some Americans have taken to keeping their wealth secret. \\u201cWe talk about it as stealth wealth. There are a lot of people that are hiding their wealth because they are concerned about negative judgment,\\u201d said Traeger-Muney. If wealthy Americans talk about the unique challenges that come with their wealth, people often dismiss their experience. \\n\\u201cPeople say 'Oh, poor you.' There is not a lot of sympathy there,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWealth is still one of our last taboos.\\u201d \\nSpeaking in his soft, soothing voice that makes you want to spill all your worries, Cockrell said that a common mistake that many of his wealthy clients make is letting their money define them. \\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s healthy to discount your problems. If you are part of the 1%, you still have problems and they are legitimate to you. Even when you say, 'I don\\u2019t have to struggle for money', there are other parts of your life. Money is not the only thing that defines you,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYour problems are legitimate.\\u201d\\n\",\n          \"If you think of the jobs robots could never do, you would probably put doctors and teachers at the top of the list. It's easy to imagine robot cleaners and factory workers, but some jobs need human connection and creativity. But are we underestimating what robots can do? In some cases, they already perform better than doctors at diagnosing illness. Also, some patients might feel more comfortable sharing personal information with a machine than a person. Could there be a place for robots in education after all?\\nBritish education expert Anthony Seldon thinks so. And he even has a date for the robot takeover of the classroom: 2027. He predicts robots will do the main job of transferring information and teachers will be like assistants. Intelligent robots will read students' faces, movements and maybe even brain signals. Then they will adapt the information to each student. It's not a popular opinion and it's unlikely robots will ever have empathy and the ability to really connect with humans like another human can.\\nOne thing is certain, though. A robot teacher is better than no teacher at all. In some parts of the world, there aren't enough teachers and 9\\u201316 per cent of children under the age of 14 don't go to school. That problem could be partly solved by robots because they can teach anywhere and won't get stressed, or tired, or move somewhere for an easier, higher-paid job.\\nThose negative aspects of teaching are something everyone agrees on. Teachers all over the world are leaving because it is a difficult job and they feel overworked. Perhaps the question is not 'Will robots replace teachers?' but 'How can robots help teachers?' Office workers can use software to do things like organise and answer emails, arrange meetings and update calendars. Teachers waste a lot of time doing non-teaching work, including more than 11 hours a week marking homework. If robots could cut the time teachers spend marking homework and writing reports, teachers would have more time and energy for the parts of the job humans do best.\",\n          \"In the philosophy of religion, creation is the action by which God brings an object into existence, while conservation is the action by which God maintains the existence of an object over time. The major monotheisms unambiguously affirm that God both created the world and conserves it. It is less clear, however, whether creation and conservation are to be conceived as distinct kinds of actions. The question has its roots in medieval and early modern characterizations of divine action, and it has received renewed attention in recent decades.\\nOn the predominant traditional view, conservation is continuous creation. Adherents of this view typically say with Francisco Su\\u00e1rez that God\\u2019s creation and conservation of things are \\u201conly conceptually distinct\\u201d (Su\\u00e1rez 1597, 120). Jonathan Edwards, for example, says, \\u201cGod\\u2019s upholding created substance, or causing its existence in each successive moment, is altogether equivalent to an immediate production out of nothing, at each moment\\u2026. So that this effect differs not at all from the first creation, but only circumstantially\\u2026\\u201d (Edwards 1758, 402; emphasis in the original). In other words, there is no real difference between the act of creation and the act of conservation, though different words may be used for them. Descartes, Malebranche, Leibniz, and Berkeley all express similar views. More recently, Philip Quinn likewise treats both God\\u2019s creating and God\\u2019s conserving as species of bringing about a thing\\u2019s existence. We call the act \\u2018creation\\u2019 if it occurs at the first time at which the creature exists, and we call it \\u2018conservation\\u2019 if it occurs at a later time, but the action is the same (e.g., Quinn 1988, 54).\\nThe alternative to this view is that the act of conserving beings that already exist differs from calling beings into existence from nothing. Some argue that each persisting creature plays a causal role in its ongoing existence, so that God is not the sole agent as in an ex nihilo creation. Some also argue that conservation must be an ongoing act, whereas creation occurs at an instant.\\nA large part of what is at stake in the debate is the relationship between divine action and creaturely action. Continuous creation theorists may reject a distinction between creation and conservation as an attempt to attribute a divine prerogative to created things. On the other hand, those who endorse a distinction may regard continuous creation theory as (to borrow a phrase) \\u201cone of those high-minded philosophical depreciations of God\\u2019s works that come disguised as compliments to God\\u2019s person\\u201d (van Inwagen 1988, 46 n4). The debate also raises a number of interesting questions about causation, time, and their relations.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 5,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          3,\n          1,\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":14}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Clean Dataset\n","from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n","class Cleaner():\n","  def __init__(self):\n","    pass\n","  def put_line_breaks(self,text):\n","    text = text.replace('</p>','</p>\\n')\n","    return text\n","  def remove_html_tags(self,text):\n","    cleantext = BeautifulSoup(text, \"lxml\").text\n","    return cleantext\n","  def clean(self,text):\n","    text = self.put_line_breaks(text)\n","    text = self.remove_html_tags(text)\n","    return text\n","\n","cleaner = Cleaner()\n","df['text_cleaned'] = df[\"text\"].apply(cleaner.clean)"],"metadata":{"id":"niSodB42YvPH","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1730979239842,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":968,"user":{"displayName":"PREMA NARAYAN OCHOA","userId":"11814823530760124735"}}},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":423},"id":"VH5b4tHEZ0Cq","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1730979252796,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":22,"user":{"displayName":"PREMA NARAYAN OCHOA","userId":"11814823530760124735"}},"outputId":"33c97fbe-534c-49c9-8f4b-f01051a61d8c"},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                   text level  \\\n","0     Hi!\\nI've been meaning to write for ages and f...

A lot of therapists do not give enough weight to their issues.\\u201d \\nSo, what issues are America\\u2019s 1% struggling with? \\u201cThere is guilt over being rich in the first place,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThere is the feeling that they have to hide the fact that they are rich. And, then, there is the isolation \\u2013 being in the 1%, it turns out, can be lonely.\\u201d It seems F Scott Fitzgerald was right: the very rich \\u201care different from you and me\\u201d. \\nCounsellors argue things have become worse since the financial crisis and the debate over income inequality that has been spurred on by movements like Occupy Wall Street and the Fight for $15 fair wage campaign. \\n\\u201cThe Occupy Wall Street movement was a good one and had some important things to say about income inequality but it singled out the 1% and painted them globally as something negative,\\u201d said Jamie Traeger-Muney, a wealth psychologist and founder of the Wealth Legacy Group. The media, she said, is partly to blame for making the rich \\u201cfeel like they need to hide or feel ashamed\\u201d. \\n\\u201cSometimes, I am shocked by things that people say.

Ironically, it\\u2019s harder to talk about having money than it is to talk about not having money. It\\u2019s much more socially acceptable to say 'I am broke. Things are hard.' You can\\u2019t say 'I have a ton of money.' You have to keep a lot of your life private.\\u201d \\nAs a result, Cockrell points out, the rich tend to hang out with other rich Americans, not out of snobbery but in order to be around those who understand them and their problems. \\nThe growing gap between the rich and poor is a global phenomenon. According to Oxfam, the richest 1% have seen their share of global wealth increase from 44% in 2009 to 48% in 2014 and are on track to own more than the other 99% by 2016. \\nIn the US, over the last three decades, the wealth owned by the top 0.1% households increased from 7% to 22% even as the wealth of the bottom 90% of households declined. \\nThe number of extremely wealthy people has also been climbing. According to research from Spectrem Group, in 2014, the number of US households with $1m or more in assets \\u2013 excluding the value of their primary home \\u2013 increased by 500,000 to 10.1m. In 2007, that number was 9.2m. Households worth $5m or more reached 1.3m and 142,000 households are now worth $25m or more. \\nSince the 2008 financial crisis, the income gap has expanded and the situation \\u201chas gotten worse for the wealthy\\u201d, Cockrell said. The main reason? Not knowing if your friends are friends with you or your money. \\n\\u201cSomeone else who is also a billionaire \\u2013 they don\\u2019t want anything from you. Never being able to trust your friendships with people of different means, I think that is difficult,\\u201d said Cockrell. \\u201cAs the gap has widened, the rich have become more and more isolated.\\u201d \\nThese are real fears faced by the richest of the rich. In 2007, the Gates Foundation teamed up with Boston College\\u2019s Center on Wealth and Philanthropy to document what it felt like to be in America\\u2019s 1%. For the next four years, researchers surveyed 165 of America\\u2019s richest households \\u2013 120 of those households have at least $25m in assets. The average net worth of those surveyed was $78m. The resulting study, The Joys and Dilemmas of Wealth, was 500 pages long and seemed to prove the old adage that money can\\u2019t buy happiness. \\n\\u201cWealth can be a barrier to connecting with other people,\\u201d confessed a spouse of a tech entrepreneur who made about $80m. Some Americans have taken to keeping their wealth secret. \\u201cWe talk about it as stealth wealth. There are a lot of people that are hiding their wealth because they are concerned about negative judgment,\\u201d said Traeger-Muney. If wealthy Americans talk about the unique challenges that come with their wealth, people often dismiss their experience. \\n\\u201cPeople say 'Oh, poor you.' There is not a lot of sympathy there,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWealth is still one of our last taboos.\\u201d \\nSpeaking in his soft, soothing voice that makes you want to spill all your worries, Cockrell said that a common mistake that many of his wealthy clients make is letting their money define them. \\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s healthy to discount your problems. If you are part of the 1%, you still have problems and they are legitimate to you. Even when you say, 'I don\\u2019t have to struggle for money', there are other parts of your life. Money is not the only thing that defines you,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYour problems are legitimate.\\u201d\\n\",\n          \"If you think of the jobs robots could never do, you would probably put doctors and teachers at the top of the list. It's easy to imagine robot cleaners and factory workers, but some jobs need human connection and creativity. But are we underestimating what robots can do? In some cases, they already perform better than doctors at diagnosing illness. Also, some patients might feel more comfortable sharing personal information with a machine than a person. Could there be a place for robots in education after all?\\nBritish education expert Anthony Seldon thinks so. And he even has a date for the robot takeover of the classroom: 2027. He predicts robots will do the main job of transferring information and teachers will be like assistants. Intelligent robots will read students' faces, movements and maybe even brain signals. Then they will adapt the information to each student. It's not a popular opinion and it's unlikely robots will ever have empathy and the ability to really connect with humans like another human can.\\nOne thing is certain, though. A robot teacher is better than no teacher at all. In some parts of the world, there aren't enough teachers and 9\\u201316 per cent of children under the age of 14 don't go to school. That problem could be partly solved by robots because they can teach anywhere and won't get stressed, or tired, or move somewhere for an easier, higher-paid job.\\nThose negative aspects of teaching are something everyone agrees on. Teachers all over the world are leaving because it is a difficult job and they feel overworked. Perhaps the question is not 'Will robots replace teachers?' but 'How can robots help teachers?' Office workers can use software to do things like organise and answer emails, arrange meetings and update calendars. Teachers waste a lot of time doing non-teaching work, including more than 11 hours a week marking homework. If robots could cut the time teachers spend marking homework and writing reports, teachers would have more time and energy for the parts of the job humans do best.\",\n          \"In the philosophy of religion, creation is the action by which God brings an object into existence, while conservation is the action by which God maintains the existence of an object over time. The major monotheisms unambiguously affirm that God both created the world and conserves it. It is less clear, however, whether creation and conservation are to be conceived as distinct kinds of actions. The question has its roots in medieval and early modern characterizations of divine action, and it has received renewed attention in recent decades.\\nOn the predominant traditional view, conservation is continuous creation. Adherents of this view typically say with Francisco Su\\u00e1rez that God\\u2019s creation and conservation of things are \\u201conly conceptually distinct\\u201d (Su\\u00e1rez 1597, 120). Jonathan Edwards, for example, says, \\u201cGod\\u2019s upholding created substance, or causing its existence in each successive moment, is altogether equivalent to an immediate production out of nothing, at each moment\\u2026. So that this effect differs not at all from the first creation, but only circumstantially\\u2026\\u201d (Edwards 1758, 402; emphasis in the original). In other words, there is no real difference between the act of creation and the act of conservation, though different words may be used for them. Descartes, Malebranche, Leibniz, and Berkeley all express similar views. More recently, Philip Quinn likewise treats both God\\u2019s creating and God\\u2019s conserving as species of bringing about a thing\\u2019s existence. We call the act \\u2018creation\\u2019 if it occurs at the first time at which the creature exists, and we call it \\u2018conservation\\u2019 if it occurs at a later time, but the action is the same (e.g., Quinn 1988, 54).\\nThe alternative to this view is that the act of conserving beings that already exist differs from calling beings into existence from nothing. Some argue that each persisting creature plays a causal role in its ongoing existence, so that God is not the sole agent as in an ex nihilo creation. Some also argue that conservation must be an ongoing act, whereas creation occurs at an instant.\\nA large part of what is at stake in the debate is the relationship between divine action and creaturely action. Continuous creation theorists may reject a distinction between creation and conservation as an attempt to attribute a divine prerogative to created things. On the other hand, those who endorse a distinction may regard continuous creation theory as (to borrow a phrase) \\u201cone of those high-minded philosophical depreciations of God\\u2019s works that come disguised as compliments to God\\u2019s person\\u201d (van Inwagen 1988, 46 n4). The debate also raises a number of interesting questions about causation, time, and their relations.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"level\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"B2\",\n          \"A2\",\n          \"C2\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1493,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Clay Cockrell is sitting in his office at Columbus Circle, across the street from 1 Central Park West, which houses Trump International Hotel and Tower.

The resulting study, The Joys and Dilemmas of Wealth, was 500 pages long and seemed to prove the old adage that money can\\u2019t buy happiness. \\n\\u201cWealth can be a barrier to connecting with other people,\\u201d confessed a spouse of a tech entrepreneur who made about $80m. Some Americans have taken to keeping their wealth secret. \\u201cWe talk about it as stealth wealth. There are a lot of people that are hiding their wealth because they are concerned about negative judgment,\\u201d said Traeger-Muney. If wealthy Americans talk about the unique challenges that come with their wealth, people often dismiss their experience. \\n\\u201cPeople say 'Oh, poor you.' There is not a lot of sympathy there,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWealth is still one of our last taboos.\\u201d \\nSpeaking in his soft, soothing voice that makes you want to spill all your worries, Cockrell said that a common mistake that many of his wealthy clients make is letting their money define them. \\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s healthy to discount your problems. If you are part of the 1%, you still have problems and they are legitimate to you. Even when you say, 'I don\\u2019t have to struggle for money', there are other parts of your life. Money is not the only thing that defines you,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYour problems are legitimate.\\u201d\\n\",\n          \"If you think of the jobs robots could never do, you would probably put doctors and teachers at the top of the list. It's easy to imagine robot cleaners and factory workers, but some jobs need human connection and creativity. But are we underestimating what robots can do? In some cases, they already perform better than doctors at diagnosing illness. Also, some patients might feel more comfortable sharing personal information with a machine than a person. Could there be a place for robots in education after all?\\nBritish education expert Anthony Seldon thinks so. And he even has a date for the robot takeover of the classroom: 2027. He predicts robots will do the main job of transferring information and teachers will be like assistants. Intelligent robots will read students' faces, movements and maybe even brain signals. Then they will adapt the information to each student. It's not a popular opinion and it's unlikely robots will ever have empathy and the ability to really connect with humans like another human can.\\nOne thing is certain, though. A robot teacher is better than no teacher at all. In some parts of the world, there aren't enough teachers and 9\\u201316 per cent of children under the age of 14 don't go to school. That problem could be partly solved by robots because they can teach anywhere and won't get stressed, or tired, or move somewhere for an easier, higher-paid job.\\nThose negative aspects of teaching are something everyone agrees on. Teachers all over the world are leaving because it is a difficult job and they feel overworked. Perhaps the question is not 'Will robots replace teachers?' but 'How can robots help teachers?' Office workers can use software to do things like organise and answer emails, arrange meetings and update calendars. Teachers waste a lot of time doing non-teaching work, including more than 11 hours a week marking homework. If robots could cut the time teachers spend marking homework and writing reports, teachers would have more time and energy for the parts of the job humans do best.\",\n          \"In the philosophy of religion, creation is the action by which God brings an object into existence, while conservation is the action by which God maintains the existence of an object over time. The major monotheisms unambiguously affirm that God both created the world and conserves it. It is less clear, however, whether creation and conservation are to be conceived as distinct kinds of actions. The question has its roots in medieval and early modern characterizations of divine action, and it has received renewed attention in recent decades.\\nOn the predominant traditional view, conservation is continuous creation. Adherents of this view typically say with Francisco Su\\u00e1rez that God\\u2019s creation and conservation of things are \\u201conly conceptually distinct\\u201d (Su\\u00e1rez 1597, 120). Jonathan Edwards, for example, says, \\u201cGod\\u2019s upholding created substance, or causing its existence in each successive moment, is altogether equivalent to an immediate production out of nothing, at each moment\\u2026. So that this effect differs not at all from the first creation, but only circumstantially\\u2026\\u201d (Edwards 1758, 402; emphasis in the original). In other words, there is no real difference between the act of creation and the act of conservation, though different words may be used for them. Descartes, Malebranche, Leibniz, and Berkeley all express similar views. More recently, Philip Quinn likewise treats both God\\u2019s creating and God\\u2019s conserving as species of bringing about a thing\\u2019s existence. We call the act \\u2018creation\\u2019 if it occurs at the first time at which the creature exists, and we call it \\u2018conservation\\u2019 if it occurs at a later time, but the action is the same (e.g., Quinn 1988, 54).\\nThe alternative to this view is that the act of conserving beings that already exist differs from calling beings into existence from nothing. Some argue that each persisting creature plays a causal role in its ongoing existence, so that God is not the sole agent as in an ex nihilo creation. Some also argue that conservation must be an ongoing act, whereas creation occurs at an instant.\\nA large part of what is at stake in the debate is the relationship between divine action and creaturely action. Continuous creation theorists may reject a distinction between creation and conservation as an attempt to attribute a divine prerogative to created things. On the other hand, those who endorse a distinction may regard continuous creation theory as (to borrow a phrase) \\u201cone of those high-minded philosophical depreciations of God\\u2019s works that come disguised as compliments to God\\u2019s person\\u201d (van Inwagen 1988, 46 n4). The debate also raises a number of interesting questions about causation, time, and their relations.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":11}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Label Encoder\n","from sklearn import preprocessing\n","le = preprocessing.LabelEncoder()\n","le.fit(df[\"level\"].tolist())\n","df['label'] = le.transform(df[\"level\"].tolist())"],"metadata":{"id":"JBkdzE__Ywvm","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1730979275447,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":2327,"user":{"displayName":"PREMA NARAYAN OCHOA","userId":"11814823530760124735"}}},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":423},"id":"LzYACWdrZ6o5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1730979281160,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":335,"user":{"displayName":"PREMA NARAYAN OCHOA","userId":"11814823530760124735"}},"outputId":"39b4fb0c-f6d0-4db3-c1cb-86ccd464fe6b"},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                   text level  \\\n","0     Hi!\\nI've been meaning to write for ages and f...

A lot of therapists do not give enough weight to their issues.\\u201d \\nSo, what issues are America\\u2019s 1% struggling with? \\u201cThere is guilt over being rich in the first place,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThere is the feeling that they have to hide the fact that they are rich. And, then, there is the isolation \\u2013 being in the 1%, it turns out, can be lonely.\\u201d It seems F Scott Fitzgerald was right: the very rich \\u201care different from you and me\\u201d. \\nCounsellors argue things have become worse since the financial crisis and the debate over income inequality that has been spurred on by movements like Occupy Wall Street and the Fight for $15 fair wage campaign. \\n\\u201cThe Occupy Wall Street movement was a good one and had some important things to say about income inequality but it singled out the 1% and painted them globally as something negative,\\u201d said Jamie Traeger-Muney, a wealth psychologist and founder of the Wealth Legacy Group. The media, she said, is partly to blame for making the rich \\u201cfeel like they need to hide or feel ashamed\\u201d. \\n\\u201cSometimes, I am shocked by things that people say. You would never refer to another group of people in the way that it seems perfectly normal to refer to wealth holders.\\u201d \\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s really isolating to have a lot of money.

Ironically, it\\u2019s harder to talk about having money than it is to talk about not having money. It\\u2019s much more socially acceptable to say 'I am broke. Things are hard.' You can\\u2019t say 'I have a ton of money.' You have to keep a lot of your life private.\\u201d \\nAs a result, Cockrell points out, the rich tend to hang out with other rich Americans, not out of snobbery but in order to be around those who understand them and their problems. \\nThe growing gap between the rich and poor is a global phenomenon. According to Oxfam, the richest 1% have seen their share of global wealth increase from 44% in 2009 to 48% in 2014 and are on track to own more than the other 99% by 2016. \\nIn the US, over the last three decades, the wealth owned by the top 0.1% households increased from 7% to 22% even as the wealth of the bottom 90% of households declined. \\nThe number of extremely wealthy people has also been climbing. According to research from Spectrem Group, in 2014, the number of US households with $1m or more in assets \\u2013 excluding the value of their primary home \\u2013 increased by 500,000 to 10.1m. In 2007, that number was 9.2m. Households worth $5m or more reached 1.3m and 142,000 households are now worth $25m or more. \\nSince the 2008 financial crisis, the income gap has expanded and the situation \\u201chas gotten worse for the wealthy\\u201d, Cockrell said. The main reason? Not knowing if your friends are friends with you or your money. \\n\\u201cSomeone else who is also a billionaire \\u2013 they don\\u2019t want anything from you. Never being able to trust your friendships with people of different means, I think that is difficult,\\u201d said Cockrell. \\u201cAs the gap has widened, the rich have become more and more isolated.\\u201d \\nThese are real fears faced by the richest of the rich. In 2007, the Gates Foundation teamed up with Boston College\\u2019s Center on Wealth and Philanthropy to document what it felt like to be in America\\u2019s 1%. For the next four years, researchers surveyed 165 of America\\u2019s richest households \\u2013 120 of those households have at least $25m in assets. The average net worth of those surveyed was $78m. The resulting study, The Joys and Dilemmas of Wealth, was 500 pages long and seemed to prove the old adage that money can\\u2019t buy happiness. \\n\\u201cWealth can be a barrier to connecting with other people,\\u201d confessed a spouse of a tech entrepreneur who made about $80m. Some Americans have taken to keeping their wealth secret. \\u201cWe talk about it as stealth wealth. There are a lot of people that are hiding their wealth because they are concerned about negative judgment,\\u201d said Traeger-Muney. If wealthy Americans talk about the unique challenges that come with their wealth, people often dismiss their experience. \\n\\u201cPeople say 'Oh, poor you.' There is not a lot of sympathy there,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWealth is still one of our last taboos.\\u201d \\nSpeaking in his soft, soothing voice that makes you want to spill all your worries, Cockrell said that a common mistake that many of his wealthy clients make is letting their money define them. \\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s healthy to discount your problems. If you are part of the 1%, you still have problems and they are legitimate to you. Even when you say, 'I don\\u2019t have to struggle for money', there are other parts of your life. Money is not the only thing that defines you,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYour problems are legitimate.\\u201d\\n\",\n          \"If you think of the jobs robots could never do, you would probably put doctors and teachers at the top of the list. It's easy to imagine robot cleaners and factory workers, but some jobs need human connection and creativity. But are we underestimating what robots can do? In some cases, they already perform better than doctors at diagnosing illness. Also, some patients might feel more comfortable sharing personal information with a machine than a person. Could there be a place for robots in education after all?\\nBritish education expert Anthony Seldon thinks so. And he even has a date for the robot takeover of the classroom: 2027. He predicts robots will do the main job of transferring information and teachers will be like assistants. Intelligent robots will read students' faces, movements and maybe even brain signals. Then they will adapt the information to each student. It's not a popular opinion and it's unlikely robots will ever have empathy and the ability to really connect with humans like another human can.\\nOne thing is certain, though. A robot teacher is better than no teacher at all. In some parts of the world, there aren't enough teachers and 9\\u201316 per cent of children under the age of 14 don't go to school. That problem could be partly solved by robots because they can teach anywhere and won't get stressed, or tired, or move somewhere for an easier, higher-paid job.\\nThose negative aspects of teaching are something everyone agrees on. Teachers all over the world are leaving because it is a difficult job and they feel overworked. Perhaps the question is not 'Will robots replace teachers?' but 'How can robots help teachers?' Office workers can use software to do things like organise and answer emails, arrange meetings and update calendars. Teachers waste a lot of time doing non-teaching work, including more than 11 hours a week marking homework. If robots could cut the time teachers spend marking homework and writing reports, teachers would have more time and energy for the parts of the job humans do best.\",\n          \"In the philosophy of religion, creation is the action by which God brings an object into existence, while conservation is the action by which God maintains the existence of an object over time. The major monotheisms unambiguously affirm that God both created the world and conserves it. It is less clear, however, whether creation and conservation are to be conceived as distinct kinds of actions. The question has its roots in medieval and early modern characterizations of divine action, and it has received renewed attention in recent decades.\\nOn the predominant traditional view, conservation is continuous creation. Adherents of this view typically say with Francisco Su\\u00e1rez that God\\u2019s creation and conservation of things are \\u201conly conceptually distinct\\u201d (Su\\u00e1rez 1597, 120). Jonathan Edwards, for example, says, \\u201cGod\\u2019s upholding created substance, or causing its existence in each successive moment, is altogether equivalent to an immediate production out of nothing, at each moment\\u2026. So that this effect differs not at all from the first creation, but only circumstantially\\u2026\\u201d (Edwards 1758, 402; emphasis in the original). In other words, there is no real difference between the act of creation and the act of conservation, though different words may be used for them. Descartes, Malebranche, Leibniz, and Berkeley all express similar views. More recently, Philip Quinn likewise treats both God\\u2019s creating and God\\u2019s conserving as species of bringing about a thing\\u2019s existence. We call the act \\u2018creation\\u2019 if it occurs at the first time at which the creature exists, and we call it \\u2018conservation\\u2019 if it occurs at a later time, but the action is the same (e.g., Quinn 1988, 54).\\nThe alternative to this view is that the act of conserving beings that already exist differs from calling beings into existence from nothing. Some argue that each persisting creature plays a causal role in its ongoing existence, so that God is not the sole agent as in an ex nihilo creation. Some also argue that conservation must be an ongoing act, whereas creation occurs at an instant.\\nA large part of what is at stake in the debate is the relationship between divine action and creaturely action. Continuous creation theorists may reject a distinction between creation and conservation as an attempt to attribute a divine prerogative to created things. On the other hand, those who endorse a distinction may regard continuous creation theory as (to borrow a phrase) \\u201cone of those high-minded philosophical depreciations of God\\u2019s works that come disguised as compliments to God\\u2019s person\\u201d (van Inwagen 1988, 46 n4). The debate also raises a number of interesting questions about causation, time, and their relations.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"level\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"B2\",\n          \"A2\",\n          \"C2\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1493,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Clay Cockrell is sitting in his office at Columbus Circle, across the street from 1 Central Park West, which houses Trump International Hotel and Tower.

The resulting study, The Joys and Dilemmas of Wealth, was 500 pages long and seemed to prove the old adage that money can\\u2019t buy happiness. \\n\\u201cWealth can be a barrier to connecting with other people,\\u201d confessed a spouse of a tech entrepreneur who made about $80m. Some Americans have taken to keeping their wealth secret. \\u201cWe talk about it as stealth wealth. There are a lot of people that are hiding their wealth because they are concerned about negative judgment,\\u201d said Traeger-Muney. If wealthy Americans talk about the unique challenges that come with their wealth, people often dismiss their experience. \\n\\u201cPeople say 'Oh, poor you.' There is not a lot of sympathy there,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWealth is still one of our last taboos.\\u201d \\nSpeaking in his soft, soothing voice that makes you want to spill all your worries, Cockrell said that a common mistake that many of his wealthy clients make is letting their money define them. \\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s healthy to discount your problems. If you are part of the 1%, you still have problems and they are legitimate to you. Even when you say, 'I don\\u2019t have to struggle for money', there are other parts of your life. Money is not the only thing that defines you,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYour problems are legitimate.\\u201d\\n\",\n          \"If you think of the jobs robots could never do, you would probably put doctors and teachers at the top of the list. It's easy to imagine robot cleaners and factory workers, but some jobs need human connection and creativity. But are we underestimating what robots can do? In some cases, they already perform better than doctors at diagnosing illness. Also, some patients might feel more comfortable sharing personal information with a machine than a person. Could there be a place for robots in education after all?\\nBritish education expert Anthony Seldon thinks so. And he even has a date for the robot takeover of the classroom: 2027. He predicts robots will do the main job of transferring information and teachers will be like assistants. Intelligent robots will read students' faces, movements and maybe even brain signals. Then they will adapt the information to each student. It's not a popular opinion and it's unlikely robots will ever have empathy and the ability to really connect with humans like another human can.\\nOne thing is certain, though. A robot teacher is better than no teacher at all. In some parts of the world, there aren't enough teachers and 9\\u201316 per cent of children under the age of 14 don't go to school. That problem could be partly solved by robots because they can teach anywhere and won't get stressed, or tired, or move somewhere for an easier, higher-paid job.\\nThose negative aspects of teaching are something everyone agrees on. Teachers all over the world are leaving because it is a difficult job and they feel overworked. Perhaps the question is not 'Will robots replace teachers?' but 'How can robots help teachers?' Office workers can use software to do things like organise and answer emails, arrange meetings and update calendars. Teachers waste a lot of time doing non-teaching work, including more than 11 hours a week marking homework. If robots could cut the time teachers spend marking homework and writing reports, teachers would have more time and energy for the parts of the job humans do best.\",\n          \"In the philosophy of religion, creation is the action by which God brings an object into existence, while conservation is the action by which God maintains the existence of an object over time. The major monotheisms unambiguously affirm that God both created the world and conserves it. It is less clear, however, whether creation and conservation are to be conceived as distinct kinds of actions. The question has its roots in medieval and early modern characterizations of divine action, and it has received renewed attention in recent decades.\\nOn the predominant traditional view, conservation is continuous creation. Adherents of this view typically say with Francisco Su\\u00e1rez that God\\u2019s creation and conservation of things are \\u201conly conceptually distinct\\u201d (Su\\u00e1rez 1597, 120). Jonathan Edwards, for example, says, \\u201cGod\\u2019s upholding created substance, or causing its existence in each successive moment, is altogether equivalent to an immediate production out of nothing, at each moment\\u2026. So that this effect differs not at all from the first creation, but only circumstantially\\u2026\\u201d (Edwards 1758, 402; emphasis in the original). In other words, there is no real difference between the act of creation and the act of conservation, though different words may be used for them. Descartes, Malebranche, Leibniz, and Berkeley all express similar views. More recently, Philip Quinn likewise treats both God\\u2019s creating and God\\u2019s conserving as species of bringing about a thing\\u2019s existence. We call the act \\u2018creation\\u2019 if it occurs at the first time at which the creature exists, and we call it \\u2018conservation\\u2019 if it occurs at a later time, but the action is the same (e.g., Quinn 1988, 54).\\nThe alternative to this view is that the act of conserving beings that already exist differs from calling beings into existence from nothing. Some argue that each persisting creature plays a causal role in its ongoing existence, so that God is not the sole agent as in an ex nihilo creation. Some also argue that conservation must be an ongoing act, whereas creation occurs at an instant.\\nA large part of what is at stake in the debate is the relationship between divine action and creaturely action. Continuous creation theorists may reject a distinction between creation and conservation as an attempt to attribute a divine prerogative to created things. On the other hand, those who endorse a distinction may regard continuous creation theory as (to borrow a phrase) \\u201cone of those high-minded philosophical depreciations of God\\u2019s works that come disguised as compliments to God\\u2019s person\\u201d (van Inwagen 1988, 46 n4). The debate also raises a number of interesting questions about causation, time, and their relations.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 5,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          3,\n          1,\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":13}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Guarda el DataFrame como un archivo CSV en Google Drive\n","df.to_csv(\"/content/drive/Shareddrives/Minería de Texto/0.

Now, for the first time, scientists have started to catalogue and map the bacteria coursing through a city\\u2019s subway \\u2013 and they have found a wealth of curious results. \\nDr Christopher Mason, a geneticist at Weill Cornell Medical College, led a team that, for 18 months, swabbed the New York City subway system for the microscopic life forms that cover its turnstiles, seats, ticket booths and stations. In what Mason called \\u201cthe first city-scale genetic profile ever\\u201d, his team found meningitis at Times Square, a trace of anthrax on the handhold of a train carriage and bacteria that cause bubonic plague on a rubbish bin and ticket machine at stations in uptown Manhattan. \\nIn research published in the journal Cell Systems, the team strongly downplayed the findings of plague and anthrax, noting the extremely small trace of the latter, that rats likely carried the former and that no one has fallen ill with plague in or around New York for years. \\n\\u201cThe results do not suggest that plague or anthrax is prevalent,\\u201d the study says. \\u201cNor do they suggest that New York residents are at risk.\\u201d \\nIn fact, most of the bacteria identified by the team are either harmless to humans or beneficial in the city\\u2019s thriving world of microorganisms, many of which process toxic hazards and waste in the same way that bacteria inside every human help with digestion and bodily functions. \\nSome of the results were expected, Mason said, including some bacteria associated with fecal matter, which he said \\u201cshould be a gentle reminder for people to wash their hands\\u201d. He also said that many bacteria of the same genus as those \\u201cthat are beneficial and helpful, like the one used for making cheese,\\u201d also turned up around New York. \\nBacteria appeared to reflect the eating habits of various neighbourhoods. All around the subway, bacteria associated with cheeses \\u2013 brie, cheddar, parmesan and the mozzarella of ubiquitous New York pizza \\u2013 turned up. The distinctive bacteria of Swiss cheese were more localized to midtown Manhattan and the financial district, and the bacteria used to ferment cabbage for kimchi and sauerkraut showed up in the financial district and Bay Ridge. The computer also identified cucumber DNA all over the city, Mason said. \\nBacteria associated with illness and infections were extremely common. Species that cause diarrhoea and nausea, both benign and bad E.coli (mostly benign), and the bacteria that can cause skin infections and urinary-tract infections were common all over the city. The species that produces tetanus appeared in Soho and bacteria that cause dysentery appeared at a station in the Bronx and another in Harlem. \\nWith more than 1,000 samples collected at all of New York\\u2019s 466 open subway stations, Mason and his team ran the organic materials through a DNA sequencer and, then, through a supercomputer armed with genetic databases. They identified 15,152 distinct species, nearly half of which were bacteria. \\nThe good news, the researchers wrote, is that these \\u201cpotentially infectious agents\\u201d are not spreading sickness or disease throughout New York but rather seem to be \\u201cnormal co-habitants\\u201d and \\u201cmay even be essential\\u201d. They \\u201crepresent a normal, 'healthy' metagenome profile of a city\\u201d. \\nIn short, the researchers conclude, the subway and city are about as safe as everyone thought. \\nMason said people should not be concerned about getting urinary-tract infections from subway seats. \\u201cYou should wash your hands,\\u201d he said, \\u201cand probably get some sleep and eat salads and go to the gym, and that\\u2019s about the same today as it was yesterday.\\u201d \\n\\u201cIf anything,\\u201d he added, \\u201cI\\u2019ve become much more confident riding the subway.\\u201d \\nMany findings made sense: heavily trafficked stations like Grand Central and Times Square had more bacteria and more diversity among them; the subway was most enriched for bacteria associated with skin. The Bronx, with its diverse neighbourhoods and stations, had the greatest diversity of bacteria; Staten Island, with just three stops, had the lowest. \\nThe researchers found marine bacteria at South Ferry, a station that flooded during Hurricane Sandy \\u2013 but they were surprised to note the species included some normally associated with Antarctica and fish. \\nThe next steps, Mason said, are studies of other cities, which have begun in Paris, S\\u00e3o Paolo and Shanghai, and continued studies of New York, for instance to see how the microbiome changes with the seasons. He said he hoped the research would provide \\u201ca baseline\\u201d of research for health officials and geneticists, and could help health officials to be better prepared to prevent and track diseases and pathogens.\\n\",\n          \"Just days after giving birth to her second child, Dr. Jane Dimer drove herself home from the hospital to find her then-husband in bed with another woman. He threw Dimer down the stairs, and she never saw him again until court.\\nRihanna was allegedly attacked by her boyfriend, singer Chris Brown, before the Grammys on February 8.\\nDimer, now an obstetrician-gynecologist at Group Health Cooperative in Seattle, Washington, had been in an abusive relationship with her husband in Germany for 4 1/2 years until he pushed her out 11 years ago.\\n Emotionally, the remnants of that stay for a long time, she said.\\nDomestic violence is the most common cause of injury to women ages 15 to 44, according to the National Institutes of Health. With the entertainment world buzzing about pop sensation Rihanna, whose boyfriend Chris Brown has been formally charged with assaulting her, public interest in domestic violence has been reinvigorated.\\nAbuse can influence a victim's future behavior in relationships and even in friendships, depending on whether the victim stays or leaves, said Mark Crawford, a clinical psychologist based in Roswell, Georgia. Those who stay are likely to stop trusting their own perceptions and become passive in both romantic and nonromantic relationships.\\nVictims who do leave -- which is the healthier choice, Crawford said -- often become over-accommodating because they want to avoid conflict, even verbal disputes, at all costs. Some women wo n't trust people easily, if at all, and wo n't be able to handle even normal expressions of anger. Visit CNNHealth.com, your connection to better living\\n What they need to do when they get out of the relationship is make sure they 're aware of their own anger, and then they can learn how to freely express it in a healthy, normal way, he said. If somebody's still having issues 10 years later, they just have n't worked through it. They have n't healed; they need to do that. \\nNew research shows that abuse victims feel the impact of violence long after it occurred. A recent study in the Journal of Women's Health found that older African-American women who were exposed to high levels of family violence at some point in their lifetimes -- whether by a partner or family member -- are at a greater risk of poor mental and physical health status.\\n Not just ongoing violence, which everybody thinks about, but even when it's over, there's something about what happens that seems to have a lingering effect that we do n't quite understand yet, said Dr. Anuradha Paranjape, co-author of the study and associate professor at Temple University School of Medicine.\\nIt makes sense that abused women would report worse health, given that people in stressful situations have higher levels of stress hormones, which interfere with immune function, Crawford said.\\nOther studies show a clear connection between depression and abuse. Adult women who have been abused in a relationship in the past five years have rates of depression 2 1/2 times greater than women who have never been abused, according to a different study of more than 3,000 women. They are also more likely to be socially isolated, said author Amy Bonomi, associate professor at The Ohio State University.\\nWomen who have been abused prior to, but not during, the past five years had depression rates 1 1/2 times greater than those without abuse experience, said Bonomi, who has collaborated with Dimer on research on abused women.\\n People like to sort of think that, Well, abuse is just when you have a black eye, you sustain a broken bone, Bonomi said. But we see lots of different effects in other areas, like depression and social isolation, and we 've actually proven that with the data. \\nWomen who have suffered violence also seem to have a greater likelihood of substance abuse, but it's unclear how the two are related -- one does n't necessarily cause the other, and there could be other factors involved, Bonomi said.\\nA 2008 study of 3,333 women, which Bonomi worked on, found that middle-aged women who suffered child abuse, sexual or other physical abuse, had a greater likelihood of depression, as well as a higher body mass index. These women also spend up to one-third more than average on health care costs. About 34 percent of women in the sample said they had been abused.\\nWhile Paranjape's study found that women with the highest levels of abuse reported having poor health, the same number of diseases were reported among those women as the women in the sample who had less or no abuse. This indicates that there is something else that makes abused women report feeling unwell, she said.\\n When your patient says they do n't feel so good, you might want to think about asking what other issues may be going on, she said.\\nPeople who have gotten out of a relationship should go through the work of learning what issues set them up in that situation, and reflect on the warning signs, Crawford said.\\nExperts recommend finding a counselor and other means of support, but people who have been abused should think twice about revealing too much in online support groups, because their abusers could discover what they 're saying, Dimer said. Research has also shown that violence escalates in abusive relationships among couples who go to marriage counseling, she said.\\nSome women do feel stronger having been through the experience of abuse, Dimer said. She herself found healing through advocacy and research on the subject, she said.\\nCalling a domestic violence hot line is a good first step for anyone who is experiencing abuse, Dimer said.\\n Whether you 're a pop star or somebody that's working front lines -- an employee at a grocery store selling the pop star magazine -- you 're at equal risk for having this, she said.\\n\",\n          \"Kimberly was not happy.

Now, for the first time, scientists have started to catalogue and map the bacteria coursing through a city\\u2019s subway \\u2013 and they have found a wealth of curious results. \\nDr Christopher Mason, a geneticist at Weill Cornell Medical College, led a team that, for 18 months, swabbed the New York City subway system for the microscopic life forms that cover its turnstiles, seats, ticket booths and stations. In what Mason called \\u201cthe first city-scale genetic profile ever\\u201d, his team found meningitis at Times Square, a trace of anthrax on the handhold of a train carriage and bacteria that cause bubonic plague on a rubbish bin and ticket machine at stations in uptown Manhattan. \\nIn research published in the journal Cell Systems, the team strongly downplayed the findings of plague and anthrax, noting the extremely small trace of the latter, that rats likely carried the former and that no one has fallen ill with plague in or around New York for years. \\n\\u201cThe results do not suggest that plague or anthrax is prevalent,\\u201d the study says. \\u201cNor do they suggest that New York residents are at risk.\\u201d \\nIn fact, most of the bacteria identified by the team are either harmless to humans or beneficial in the city\\u2019s thriving world of microorganisms, many of which process toxic hazards and waste in the same way that bacteria inside every human help with digestion and bodily functions. \\nSome of the results were expected, Mason said, including some bacteria associated with fecal matter, which he said \\u201cshould be a gentle reminder for people to wash their hands\\u201d. He also said that many bacteria of the same genus as those \\u201cthat are beneficial and helpful, like the one used for making cheese,\\u201d also turned up around New York. \\nBacteria appeared to reflect the eating habits of various neighbourhoods. All around the subway, bacteria associated with cheeses \\u2013 brie, cheddar, parmesan and the mozzarella of ubiquitous New York pizza \\u2013 turned up. The distinctive bacteria of Swiss cheese were more localized to midtown Manhattan and the financial district, and the bacteria used to ferment cabbage for kimchi and sauerkraut showed up in the financial district and Bay Ridge. The computer also identified cucumber DNA all over the city, Mason said. \\nBacteria associated with illness and infections were extremely common. Species that cause diarrhoea and nausea, both benign and bad E.coli (mostly benign), and the bacteria that can cause skin infections and urinary-tract infections were common all over the city. The species that produces tetanus appeared in Soho and bacteria that cause dysentery appeared at a station in the Bronx and another in Harlem. \\nWith more than 1,000 samples collected at all of New York\\u2019s 466 open subway stations, Mason and his team ran the organic materials through a DNA sequencer and, then, through a supercomputer armed with genetic databases. They identified 15,152 distinct species, nearly half of which were bacteria. \\nThe good news, the researchers wrote, is that these \\u201cpotentially infectious agents\\u201d are not spreading sickness or disease throughout New York but rather seem to be \\u201cnormal co-habitants\\u201d and \\u201cmay even be essential\\u201d. They \\u201crepresent a normal, 'healthy' metagenome profile of a city\\u201d. \\nIn short, the researchers conclude, the subway and city are about as safe as everyone thought. \\nMason said people should not be concerned about getting urinary-tract infections from subway seats. \\u201cYou should wash your hands,\\u201d he said, \\u201cand probably get some sleep and eat salads and go to the gym, and that\\u2019s about the same today as it was yesterday.\\u201d \\n\\u201cIf anything,\\u201d he added, \\u201cI\\u2019ve become much more confident riding the subway.\\u201d \\nMany findings made sense: heavily trafficked stations like Grand Central and Times Square had more bacteria and more diversity among them; the subway was most enriched for bacteria associated with skin. The Bronx, with its diverse neighbourhoods and stations, had the greatest diversity of bacteria; Staten Island, with just three stops, had the lowest. \\nThe researchers found marine bacteria at South Ferry, a station that flooded during Hurricane Sandy \\u2013 but they were surprised to note the species included some normally associated with Antarctica and fish. \\nThe next steps, Mason said, are studies of other cities, which have begun in Paris, S\\u00e3o Paolo and Shanghai, and continued studies of New York, for instance to see how the microbiome changes with the seasons. He said he hoped the research would provide \\u201ca baseline\\u201d of research for health officials and geneticists, and could help health officials to be better prepared to prevent and track diseases and pathogens.\\n\",\n          \"Just days after giving birth to her second child, Dr. Jane Dimer drove herself home from the hospital to find her then-husband in bed with another woman. He threw Dimer down the stairs, and she never saw him again until court.\\nRihanna was allegedly attacked by her boyfriend, singer Chris Brown, before the Grammys on February 8.\\nDimer, now an obstetrician-gynecologist at Group Health Cooperative in Seattle, Washington, had been in an abusive relationship with her husband in Germany for 4 1/2 years until he pushed her out 11 years ago.\\n Emotionally, the remnants of that stay for a long time, she said.\\nDomestic violence is the most common cause of injury to women ages 15 to 44, according to the National Institutes of Health. With the entertainment world buzzing about pop sensation Rihanna, whose boyfriend Chris Brown has been formally charged with assaulting her, public interest in domestic violence has been reinvigorated.\\nAbuse can influence a victim's future behavior in relationships and even in friendships, depending on whether the victim stays or leaves, said Mark Crawford, a clinical psychologist based in Roswell, Georgia. Those who stay are likely to stop trusting their own perceptions and become passive in both romantic and nonromantic relationships.\\nVictims who do leave -- which is the healthier choice, Crawford said -- often become over-accommodating because they want to avoid conflict, even verbal disputes, at all costs. Some women wo n't trust people easily, if at all, and wo n't be able to handle even normal expressions of anger.

If somebody's still having issues 10 years later, they just have n't worked through it. They have n't healed; they need to do that. \\nNew research shows that abuse victims feel the impact of violence long after it occurred. A recent study in the Journal of Women's Health found that older African-American women who were exposed to high levels of family violence at some point in their lifetimes -- whether by a partner or family member -- are at a greater risk of poor mental and physical health status.\\n Not just ongoing violence, which everybody thinks about, but even when it's over, there's something about what happens that seems to have a lingering effect that we do n't quite understand yet, said Dr. Anuradha Paranjape, co-author of the study and associate professor at Temple University School of Medicine.\\nIt makes sense that abused women would report worse health, given that people in stressful situations have higher levels of stress hormones, which interfere with immune function, Crawford said.\\nOther studies show a clear connection between depression and abuse. Adult women who have been abused in a relationship in the past five years have rates of depression 2 1/2 times greater than women who have never been abused, according to a different study of more than 3,000 women. They are also more likely to be socially isolated, said author Amy Bonomi, associate professor at The Ohio State University.\\nWomen who have been abused prior to, but not during, the past five years had depression rates 1 1/2 times greater than those without abuse experience, said Bonomi, who has collaborated with Dimer on research on abused women.\\n People like to sort of think that, Well, abuse is just when you have a black eye, you sustain a broken bone, Bonomi said. But we see lots of different effects in other areas, like depression and social isolation, and we 've actually proven that with the data. \\nWomen who have suffered violence also seem to have a greater likelihood of substance abuse, but it's unclear how the two are related -- one does n't necessarily cause the other, and there could be other factors involved, Bonomi said.\\nA 2008 study of 3,333 women, which Bonomi worked on, found that middle-aged women who suffered child abuse, sexual or other physical abuse, had a greater likelihood of depression, as well as a higher body mass index. These women also spend up to one-third more than average on health care costs. About 34 percent of women in the sample said they had been abused.\\nWhile Paranjape's study found that women with the highest levels of abuse reported having poor health, the same number of diseases were reported among those women as the women in the sample who had less or no abuse. This indicates that there is something else that makes abused women report feeling unwell, she said.\\n When your patient says they do n't feel so good, you might want to think about asking what other issues may be going on, she said.\\nPeople who have gotten out of a relationship should go through the work of learning what issues set them up in that situation, and reflect on the warning signs, Crawford said.\\nExperts recommend finding a counselor and other means of support, but people who have been abused should think twice about revealing too much in online support groups, because their abusers could discover what they 're saying, Dimer said. Research has also shown that violence escalates in abusive relationships among couples who go to marriage counseling, she said.\\nSome women do feel stronger having been through the experience of abuse, Dimer said. She herself found healing through advocacy and research on the subject, she said.\\nCalling a domestic violence hot line is a good first step for anyone who is experiencing abuse, Dimer said.\\n Whether you 're a pop star or somebody that's working front lines -- an employee at a grocery store selling the pop star magazine -- you 're at equal risk for having this, she said.\\n\",\n          \"Kimberly was not happy.
