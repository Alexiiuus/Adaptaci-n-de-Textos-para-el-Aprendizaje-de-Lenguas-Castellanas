"Hello!
I've been wanting to write for years and finally today I'm doing something about it. Not that I'm trying to excuse myself, it's been very difficult to sit and write, as I've been moving so much. Since the last time we met, I've unpacked my bags in four different cities. This work has turned out to be more of a whirlwind than I expected, but everything is fine!
I went from London to Prague to establish a new regional office there. You know I always wanted to go, but maybe I was imagining Prague in the spring when I used to talk about it. Winter was very hard, with less than 15 degrees in the morning and dark very early at night. But at least they were blue skies and white snow and not days at the end of gray skies and rain, as at home. It's hard to be away from home on Christmas, though, and Skype on Christmas Day wasn't the same as being with everyone.
From there I was on another three-month mission to oversee the installation of the New York office. Beloved, beloved, beloved New York! It's like being on a big TV show, since everywhere it seems a little familiar. I did all the tourist things you could think of when I wasn't working, and I must have spent most of my salary on eating out. It was very difficult to get out for the next job, especially when I met someone (!) More information about Michael later...
So they sent me to Los Angeles, which felt like another country compared to the East Coast. I could definitely get used to that kind of outdoor lifestyle on the beach, but I didn't spend as much time getting to know California as I could because I flew back to see Michael every two weekends. He came to see me when he could, but his job means he often works on weekends, so he couldn't make the flight very often. Those three months flew by and then I went back to Frankfurt, which is where I am now. And... Michael too! He's got a month's work off and we're trying to figure out how we can be in the same place at the same time for a while. We imagine the first step in that direction is getting married, which is also why I wanted to write – I can't get married without my oldest friend there! The wedding will be home in London in September and I hope you can come.
Anyway, tell me all your news and I promise not to leave it that long this time!
A lot of love,

"It was not so hard how people found the challenge, but how far they would go to avoid what left the researchers swallowed. The homework? Sit in a chair and do nothing but think.
Some found it so unbearable that they took advantage of the safe but alarming opportunity to give themselves mild electric shocks in an attempt to break the tedium.
Two-thirds of the men pressed a button to deliver a painful shock during a 15-minute spell of solitude.
Under the same conditions, a quarter of the women pressed the shock button. The difference, scientists suspect, is that men tend to look for more sensations than women.
The report by the psychologists of the Universities of Virginia and Harvard is one of the few surprising ones to address the question of why most of us find it so difficult to do nothing.
In more than 11 separate studies, researchers showed that people hated being left to think, regardless of their age, education, income, or the amount of time they spent using smartphones or social networks.
Timothy Wilson, who led the work, said the findings were not necessarily a reflection of the pace of modern life or the spread of mobile devices and social networks. Instead, those things could be popular because of our constant desire to do something instead of nothing.
The first series of experiments began with students who were introduced – alone, without phones, books or anything to write with – into a room without ornaments and were told to think. The only rules were for them to sit down and not fall asleep. They were informed – specifically or vaguely – that they would have six to fifteen minutes alone.
The students were interrogated when time ran out. On average, they did not enjoy the experience. They fought to concentrate. Their minds wandered even with nothing distracting them. Even giving them time to think about what it didn't help.
In case the unknown environment hindered the ability to think, the researchers carried out the experiment again with the people at home.
They got the same results, only people found the experience even more miserable and deceived by getting out of their chair or checking their phones.
To see if the effect was found only on the students, scientists recruited more than 100 people, aged 18 to 77, from a church and a farmers' market. They, too, disliked being left in the hands of their thoughts.
However, the most amazing result was yet to come. To see if people could really prefer something bad to anything at all, students were given the option of managing a mild electrical shock.
Before they had been asked to assess how unpleasant shocks were, along with other options, such as looking at pictures of cockroaches or hearing the sound of a knife rubbing against a bottle.
All students chosen for the test said they would pay to avoid mild electric shocks after receiving a demonstration.
To the surprise of the researchers, 12 of the 18 men were given four electric shocks, as were 6 of 24 women.
“What draws attention is that simply being alone with your thoughts was apparently so aversive that it led many participants to self-manage an electrical shock that they had previously said they would pay to avoid,” writes scientists at Science.
Jessica Andrews-Hanna at the University of Colorado said that many students would probably go away to encourage a tedious lecture. But, he says we need to know more about the motivation of surprises in Wilson's studio.
“Imagine the setup – a person is told to sit in a chair with cables attached to his skin and a button that will give a harmless but uncomfortable impact, and is told to sit there and entertain with his thoughts,” he said.
“As you sit there, tied to this machine, your mind begins to wander and naturally goes to that shock – was it really that bad?
“What are experimenters really interested in? Perhaps this is a case where curiosity killed the cat.”",B2
"Keith recently returned from a trip to Chicago, Illinois. This midwestern metropolis is located along the shore of Lake Michigan. During his visit, Keith spent a lot of time exploring the city to visit important monuments and monuments.
Keith loves baseball, and he made sure to pay a visit to Wrigley Field. Not only did he tour this spectacular stadium, but he also had to watch a Chicago Cubs game. At the stadium, Keith and the other fans cheered up the Cubs. Keith was happy the Cubs won with a score of 5-4.
Chicago has many historic places to visit. Keith found the Chicago Water Tower impressive as it is one of the few remaining landmarks to have survived the Chicago Great Fire of 1871. Keith also took a stroll through Jackson Park, a large outdoor space that hosted the 1892 World Fair. The park is ideal for a quiet walk, and still has some of the original architectures and replicas of monuments that were presented at the World Fair.
During the last part of his visit, Keith managed to climb the stairs inside the Willis Tower, a 110-story skyscraper. Despite the challenge of climbing the many flights of stairs, Keith felt that reaching the top was worth the effort. From the roof, Keith received a beautiful view of the city's horizon with Lake Michigan in the background.",B2
"Griffith Observatory is a planetarium and exhibition hall located in Griffith Park in Los Angeles. It features several astronomical screens and telescopes on the Hollywood hills in the city's Los Feliz district. The Observatory was built on land donated by Griffith J. Griffith in 1896. Griffith was a Welsh-born philanthropist and miner tycoon who wanted to give the public access to a state-of-the-art observatory, making it free for visitors. He felt that ordinary people should be able to enjoy the wonders of the universe, and not just for the scientific community.
Griffith donated 3,015 acres of land specifically to house the observatory that opened its doors on May 14, 1935. During the first five days after the inauguration, the planetarium averaged more than 13,000 visitors a day. One of the main attractions was the Foucault Pendulum which is designed to show the rotation of the earth and the Zeiss reflector telescope. The observatory has an impressive view of Los Angeles and Hollywood, and the Pacific Ocean can be seen on clear days from there.
In 2002, the planetarium underwent a $93 million renovation and expansion, which closed the museum for four years. After its reopening in 2006, the facility expanded underground with new exhibitions, a coffee shop, a gift shop and a theatre. The Wilder Hall of the Eye section focuses on the astronomical aspect of the observatory. It is where people can see the stars through the observatory telescope, and has an interactive exhibition that is very popular. The Ahmanson Hall of the Sky is another popular attraction to see images in the night sky that are visible to the naked eye. The observatory often sets observation nights when the public is invited to bring their own telescopes. It is open every day and is still free of charge.",B2

"There may be different types of entertainment at a wedding reception. There will usually be a Master of Ceremonies, or MC, who helps move the reception by making announcements of what will happen next. For example, the MC will announce when the newly married couple enters the reception room, and all guests will stand up and applaud. A wedding reception usually has music and guests are expected to dance. The music can be provided by a DJ or a live band. Sometimes the DJ or live band will accept requests from guests to play a particular song. When the newlywed couple enters the reception, they will share a dance for themselves to a song they chose beforehand. Usually, the song is romantic and represents the couple's love for each other. Sometimes the bride shares a dance with her father and the groom shares a dance with his mother. After these special dances, guests are invited to the dance floor.

The meal at a wedding reception can be buffet style, where everyone serves himself, or it can be a sitting meal served by waiters. Guests can choose from an offer of meat, chicken or fish. Guests usually make their decisions when they respond to initial wedding invitations.
During a wedding, guests should not expect to spend too much time with the bride and groom. The new couple is usually very busy waving to all their guests. Sometimes the couple don't even have a chance to eat. What almost all newly married couples can eat at their wedding reception is the wedding cake. The bride and groom traditionally cut the wedding cake together, and then feed the other person a bite.",B2
"Facebook has lost millions of users a month in its larger markets, suggesting independent data, as alternative social networks attract the attention of those looking for new online playgrounds.
While Facebook is preparing to update investors on their performance in the first three months of the year, with analysts predicting revenue an increase of 36% over last year, studies suggest that their expansion in the US, UK and other major European countries has peaked. In the last month, the world's largest social network has lost 6 million American visitors, a 4% drop, according to the Socialbakers analysis firm. In the United Kingdom, 1.4 million fewer users were registered in March, a drop of 4.5%. The descents are maintained. Over the past six months, Facebook has lost nearly 9 million visitors per month to the United States and 2 million in the United Kingdom.
Users are also disconnecting in Canada, Spain, France, Germany and Japan, where Facebook has some of its biggest followers. A Facebook spokesperson refused to comment.
“The problem is that, in the United States and the United Kingdom, most people who want to sign up for Facebook have already done so,” said new media specialist Ian Maude at Enders Analysis. “There is a boredom factor in which people like to try something new. Is Facebook going to follow MySpace's path? The risk is relatively small, but that doesn’t mean it’s not there.” Alternative social networks such as Instagram, the photo sharing site that won 30 million users in 18 months before Facebook acquired the business, have seen increases in popularity among younger age groups.
Path, the mobile-based social network founded by former Facebook employee Dave Morin, which restricts its users to 150 friends, is earning 1 million users a week. It has recently surpassed 9m users, with 500,000 Venezuelans downloading the app in a single weekend.
Facebook continues to grow rapidly in South America. Monthly visitors to Brazil increased by 6% in the last month to 70m, according to Socialbakers, whose information is used by Facebook advertisers. India has seen an increase of 4 per cent to 64 million, a fraction of the country ' s population, leaving room for further growth.
But in developed markets, other Facebook tracking is reporting declines. Bank analysts Jefferies have developed an algorithm that interacts directly with Facebook software and that “sugges user levels in [the first quarter] may have declined since the peak.”
Jefferies saw the world peak of 1.05 billion a month in January, before falling by 20 meters in February. The numbers increased again in April. The network has lost nearly 2 million visitors to the UK since December, according to research firm Nielsen, with its total of 27 million inhabitants a year earlier.
The number of minutes Americans spend on Facebook seems to be falling, too. The total was 121 billion minutes in December 2012, but that fell to 115 billion minutes in February, according to comScore.
As Facebook itself has warned, the time spent on their pages of those sitting in front of personal computers is rapidly decreasing because we are changing our screen time to smartphones and tablets.
While smartphone minutes have doubled in one year, to 69 per month, that growth is not guaranteed to compensate for the decrease in desktop usage.
Facebook is the most authoritative source in its own user numbers, and the firm will update investors on its performance for the quarter. Wall Street expects revenues of about $1.44 billion, compared to $1.06 billion in 2012.
Shareholders will be particularly interested in learning how fast Facebook’s mobile user base is growing, and whether advertising revenue is growing at the same pace.
Mobile usage accounted for almost a quarter of Facebook's advertising revenue at the end of 2012, and the network had 680 million mobile users per month in December.
The company warned in recent stock exchange presentations that it might be losing “younger users” to “other products and services similar to, or as a substitute for, Facebook.”
Hot competition from the services that were invented for the mobile phone instead of the PC, founder Mark Zuckerberg has recently driven through a series of new initiatives designed to attract smartphone users. The most significant is Facebook Home, software that can be downloaded on certain Android phones to feed news and photos of friends – and advertising – directly to the owner's blocked home screen.

"Easter is a Jewish feast that recalls and celebrates its liberation from ancient Egyptian slavery as described in the Old Testament of the Bible. It is traditionally held in spring and lasts about a week.

According to Bible history, God punished ancient Egypt with 10 plagues. The last plague killed first-born Egyptian men. The Jews were told to mark their doors with lamb's blood so that God would know how to pass over these houses and not kill any firstborn male within. From here comes the name of the feast, Easter. After this last plague, the Egyptian king, known as Pharaoh, agreed to free the ancient Jews from slavery. Bible history also says that the Jewish people left their homes in such a hurry after they were released that they had no time to wait for the bread to rise. That is why at the Passover memorial dinner, Jews eat matzo, unleavened bread, also known as unleavened bread. Matzo and other foods are eaten at a special meal called seder.
There are very specific rituals that happen in the Seder food. These rituals are all in a book called the Haggadah. Within the Haggadah is also the story of the Jewish exodus from Egypt. During the meal of the seder parts of the Haggadah are read aloud. The first part of the meal is a blessing on wine. The second part of the meal is hand washing. The third part of the meal is when someone dips some kind of vegetables in salt water and then eats the vegetables. The vegetable symbolizes the humble origins of the Jewish people. Water symbolizes their tears. The fourth part of the meal is when three pieces of matzo are broken.",B2
"Stephanie recently made a weekend trip to Los Angeles, California. Los Angeles is a coastal city located along the Pacific Ocean. Many celebrities gained their fame here. Although the city offers many attractions focused on Hollywood culture, there is much to see and visit in Los Angeles.
Of course, all things related to Hollywood are popular tourist attractions. The Hollywood Sign, located in the Hollywood hills of the Santa Monica Mountains, is a famous landmark for this star-filled city. Once in downtown Hollywood, it is possible to take a walk along the Hollywood Walk of Fame. This milestone contains over 2500 brass stars dedicated to celebrities who have had a significant impact on the entertainment industry. In Hollywood, visitors can even tour popular film studios. Stephanie had the opportunity to visit Universal Studios, which produces her favorite films.
Los Angeles is also a popular beach town, offering plenty of opportunities to sunbathe and surf. A common beach destination is the Santa Monica pier, which offers walks and attractions to its visitors. Here, Stephanie rode the iconic Ferris wheel, which offered her a spectacular view of the city and the coast.
These are just some of the things Stephanie experienced during her visit to Los Angeles. He loved his trip, and he hopes to come back some day soon.",B2
"- LSB- Last minute alert, 6:23 a.m. GMT - LRB- 01:23 a.m. ET-RRB-RSB-
Scotland will remain part of the United Kingdom -- together with England, Wales and Northern Ireland -- after a historic referendum vote. A majority of voters rejected the possibility of Scotland breaking up and becoming an independent nation.
With 31 of the 32 councils declared, the campaign has not won the referendum on Scottish independence.
Scottish Prime Minister Alex Salmond admitted defeat in Scotland's independence referendum on Friday, and urged the rest of Scotland to do the same.
In a televised statement, he thanked Scotland for 1.6 million votes in favour of Scottish independence. An 86% share is one of the highest in the democratic world for any such vote, he said.
-LSB- Original story published at 12.37 p.m. ET-RSB-
Voters in Scotland made their election on Thursday -- they're still part of the UK, or they're their own independent nation. They decided to stay.
With 31 out of 32 councils reporting, the campaign had not obtained enough votes to secure its victory, and with it the continued place of Scotland within the union.
The first councils that declared everything went to campaign No, like the capital, Edinburgh, which overwhelmingly voted to remain in the union with 123,927 votes in favour and 194,628 votes against. Argyll and Bute and Aberdeenshire also voted No.
Glasgow won a solid victory for the field of independence with 194,779 votes in favour of Yes, and 169,347 against, but the advantage was not big enough to overthrow the general majority of Camp No so far, which maintains 8 % - LRB- 54 % to 46 % -RRB - over the pro-independence camp.
Most of the first results have gone on the path of the anti-independence camp. The campaign did not extend leadership with the results of the council of Angus and East Dunbartonshire, along with a landslide in Dumfries and Galloway. The oil-rich city of Aberdeen also voted strongly for the trade union camp.
The city of Dundee was the first big gain for the independence campaign, voting yes with 53,620 votes in favour, 39,880 against.
The individual recounts of local authorities are ultimately irrelevant, as it is the total number of votes across the country that will determine the outcome.
Surveys in more than 5,500 stations in all districts, from the remote highlands and islands to the major cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, closed at 22.00 local time - LRB-5 p.m. ET-RRB-. People who were still online to vote at that time were allowed to cast votes.
High participation
The first districts to report participation reported high participation -- much more than 80 per cent in most cases -- Mary Pitcaithly, head of counting, announced in Edinburgh.
Participation in Glasgow, one of the focal points of the Yes campaign, was a relatively disappointing 75%.
More than 4.2 million people registered to vote on the issue: Should Scotland be an independent country?
A vote for independence would mean that Scotland, with a population of about 5.3 million, is divided from the rest of the United Kingdom, consisting of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, in addition to Scotland.
The people of Scotland have participated in this conversation, Phil MacHugh, a spokesman for Yes camp, told CNN on Thursday night. They've really come out, they've discovered the information they wanted to know, and they've made that decision today.
Address by the Prime Minister
British Prime Minister David Cameron will make a speech on Friday morning. The content will depend on the outcome of the vote, but in case Scottish voters decide to remain in the union, Downing Street says it will refer to plans for further redistribution of powers from central government to the Scottish Parliament, signed by Westminster leaders earlier this week.
Edinburgh counting officer Sue Bruce explained shortly after 10 p.m. that each vote will be verified twice, to verify the decision of each voter.
Addressing dozens of election workers, Bruce added, I look forward to working with you throughout the night to offer a precise and transparent Edinburgh count where you and Edinburgh voters can have full confidence.
The vote was quick at an election table in Glasgow when polls opened on Thursday, with many people voting on the way to work or before taking their children to school.
Bad weather or the large volume of votes cast could slow down the counting process. However, the weather forecast seems good so far; it is important that some ballot boxes are collected by helicopter, plane or boat from polling stations in distant islands.
Allegations of electoral fraud were reported by Glasgow City Council, with several instances of people appearing in the polling booths in Scotland's largest city to vote, only to be informed that they had already voted.
The Council stressed that there was never really a double-vote situation and that the ballot papers concerned are now being sought and withdrawn.
Scottish Prime Minister Alex Salmond, who has led the campaign for independence Yes Scotland, cast his vote Thursday morning in the village of Strichen, Aberdeenshire.
Labour legislator Alistair Darling, who has led the pro-union campaign Better Together, backed by Westminster's main parties, voted in Edinburgh, while former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, another pro-union activist, voted in the city of Kirkcaldy.
For the first time, the vote was extended to 16- and 17-year-olds living in Scotland. Almost 110,000 persons under the age of 18 have registered to vote.
Voters in the referendum did not have to be British citizens; Commonwealth, Irish and EU citizens living in Scotland and registered to vote there can cast a vote. However, Scots living outside Scotland have nothing to say.
Almost 790,000 people applied for a postal vote, the largest volume of registration for postal votes in Scotland.
After the polls closed, Salmond tweeted, “This has been a remarkable day. Scotland's future is really in Scotland's hands.
Nic Robertson of CNN reported from Glasgow, Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London and Euan McKirdy wrote and reported in Hong Kong. Richard Allen Greene, Lindsay Isaac and Greg Botelho of CNN contributed to this report.

"Countries rarely fail to fulfil their obligations, at least not in the basic understanding of the term.
If you or I can't pay our bills and creditors come to call, we can eventually declare bankruptcy and move on painfully. Most of our creditors recover little or nothing. And companies do it all the time, in fact, it seems like a matter of course for American airlines.
But countries don't break. They choose to stop paying, one way or another.
The difference? Countries receive new contributors every day. They're born or migrated. Countries cannot become insolvent. They stop paying to save money.

How do they choose by default? Politicians can flirt with financial suicide, such as some members of the U.S. Congress. They like to do. But let's be clear, America. They weren't going by default. The confrontation was only political.
The United States has enormous credibility and runs no risk of non-compliance, Anne Pettifor of Prime Economics told me. In my opinion, there is no chance that the United States would They default on their debt.
So, the US. cannot really default, thanks in part to a strong Federal Reserve and international creditors who still want to buy their bonds, no matter how low the interest rate falls.
But other countries have opted for non-compliance, at least in theory. From Argentina to Russia and North Korea, countries have stopped paying the interest or principle of national or international obligations.
In the case of Russia, it was able to pay creditors in a few years, thanks to rising energy prices. Russia did not move away from its creditors.

Argentina was a much more difficult case. When he stopped paying creditors at the end of 2001, he caused much pain to his citizens in 2002-2003. His efforts to reach an agreement with creditors are still bubbling in the New York courts. No one can say that Argentina has fully regained its reputation on international markets. Some bondholders simply refuse to take a share of what they are owed and move on. They want their money back.
However, its economy grew rapidly within a few years of non-compliance. Does that mean that non-compliance is not a terrible step? After all, it means that a country can take over its obligations.
Debts become more manageable and therefore the country becomes more credit, Pettifor said. Then, however, creditors pile up.

Nazi Germany failed in 1933. The new government was not going to meet the obligations of previous leaders. We all know how it went. It was decades before part of the German debt was paid symbolically.
No eurozone country has unilaterally refused to pay its bills. The market made it impossible for Ireland and Greece to issue new bonds at a sustainable interest rate. The new creditors intervened, instead of moving away. We know them as the troika, composed of the European Central Bank, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.

In 2010, the NASA planetary defence team had identified and recorded 90 per cent of the 1 km wide near-Earth asteroids. These 'near-Earth objects', or OCTs, are the size of mountains and include anything within 50 million kilometers of Earth's orbit. With an estimated 50 to record, NASA says none of the 887 it knows is a significant danger to the planet.
B
NASA is now working on the felling of some of the smaller asteroids, which are 140 meters wide or larger. Of the estimated 25,000 asteroids of this size, some 8,000 have so far been recorded, leaving 17,000 missing. Considering that a 19-meter asteroid that exploded over the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia in 2013 injured 1,200 people, these medium-sized asteroids would be a serious danger if they entered Earth's orbit.
C
If NASA can find the remaining medium-sized OCTs, it depends on getting the money to build NEOCam, a 0.5 meter space telescope that would use infrared light to locate asteroids. If he got the money, he could probably reach his target in ten years. Once registered, the planetary defense team would still have to find a way to defend the planet against the impact of truly worrying asteroids: PAHs.
D
""Potentially dangerous asteroids"" are rocks close enough to pass less than 7.5 million kilometers from Earth's orbit. NASA has created a map of 1,400 PAH, none of which is expected to be a threat in the next hundred years. With the technology already available, NASA can track these objects and make predictions about possible impacts, at which point two defense solutions could be launched.
E
The first is DART – the Double Asteroid Redirection Test. Plans are scheduled to test DART on the moon of an asteroid called Didymos. 'Didymoon' is 150 meters wide, orbiting its 800-meter mother, and it is expected that DART's impact will take her out of orbit enough for Earth-based telescopes to capture.
F
Another suggested defense against an ongoing PAH hitting the Earth is to blow it up using a nuclear weapon. It may sound like a plot from a movie, and it was the theme of the 1998 film Armageddon, but the Hypervelocity Emergency Response Asteroid Mitigation Mission (HAMMER) is a genuine proposal from NASA. Eight-ton rockets would be fired at an asteroid approaching in the hope of hitting it off course. If the asteroid were too close to Earth for this plan to work, the rockets would carry nuclear bombs to blow it up.",B2
"At least eight people have died after a strange mix of weather across the country triggered tornadoes, ice storms and record heat this weekend.
Four of the deaths involved two vehicle accidents in Kentucky. Three people drowned in the Rolling Fork River near New Hope when a car got into the water. Two people escaped but were hospitalized with hypothermia.
The water was off the banks, considerably in the area of the road. They ran their vehicle into the water. Two of the people were leaving the vehicle when the fast water started pushing the vehicle downstream. The other three occupants of the vehicle were unable to leave, said Joe Prewitt, with Nelson County Emergency Management.
In the other accident, a rider on an ATV overturned into a stream near Carrollton and was trapped below.
Kentucky Emergency Management reported a fifth death from flooded waters in Ballard County, but provided no details.
The authorities did not release the identity of the victims.
Several flood warnings remained in effect on Sunday along some rivers and streams in Kentucky.
Two deaths occurred in the counties of Coahoma and Jasper, Mississippi, where severe weather damaged houses and downed trees, according to the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency.
The eighth death came from a traffic accident near Kansas City, said Chris Redline of the Missouri Department of Transportation.
We also had to close many roads in southeastern Missouri due to flooding, Redline said.
Floods, extreme cold and unsatisfactory heat covered other parts of the country. To make sense of everything, let us take you on an American tour.
Southeast: Thunderstorms, tornadoes and torrential rain showers
Heavy rain, harmful winds and lightning continued. These storms were expected to spread, bringing downpours to Georgia, South Carolina, and the east coast until Monday.
The cooler the weather is expected to be much calmer and drier Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.
On Saturday night, the National Weather Service said that a tornado was likely to be guilty of damage in central Mississippi, including four overturned semi-trucks and five heavily damaged houses.
The main trigger of severe weather is temperatures above the average further north.
Midwest: Snow with lake effect
Sara Hadley sent pictures of CNN iReport on Sunday after a storm in Lansing, Michigan.
It didn't start so bad until we lost power last night. At the time we knew it was getting bad. The last time we had ice like this was in 1998, she wrote.
His images showed pine branches and cones covered by thin ice sheets.
Moderate to heavy snow was expected improved by the lake for the far west and north center of Michigan until Monday night.
Central plains: beaten with ice and snow
The temperatures will be 15 to 25 degrees cooler than normal Monday with a gradual moderation on Christmas Day.
In Kansas and southeastern Nebraska, snowfalls add up to 3 to 6 inches. And those cold temperatures will keep people shaking.

If there is a present transmitted as winter begins, it is the temperatures far above average in the Atlantic.
New York City broke a record on Sunday, according to Ashley Sears, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service.
-LRB- The record -RRB- was 63 degrees in 1998. And we're currently sitting at 70 degrees, where we've been for the last two hours, he said.
Further north, however, the situation has been less welcoming. In Maine and throughout New Hampshire, Vermont and northern New York, winter warnings -- including ice storms and ice rain -- were in effect.
Government of New York. Andrew Cuomo declared a winter ice emergency and activated the state's emergency operations center.
The Buffalo National Weather Service said that up to an inch of ice accumulation is expected, and areas near the San Lorenzo and Negro rivers could see even more.
Canada: Unusually cold
Toronto Mayor Rob Ford described winter Sunday as one of the worst storms in the city's history.
He said he hopes that power will be restored to the more than 250,000 customers currently without him by Christmas Day.
Toronto Police Sergeant. Jeff Zammit said it has been colder than normal during December, and that the icy rain and fallen trees have knocked down many power lines.
It's really a catastrophic ice storm we've had here, probably one of the worst we've ever had, Toronto Hydro CEO Anthony Haines told CTV Network.
For serviced customers, the company asked them to share power and consider asking the neighbors inside.
The city has also opened heating stations.

"Valentine's Day, February 14, is a celebration of love and friendship in the United States. Most people think of it as a romantic day to show the one you love how much you care about buying cards and gifts. Valentine's Day is also an extremely commercial holiday. People spend money on flowers, balloons, chocolate, stuffed animals and jewelry. People also go out for expensive dinners. Valentine's Day is even celebrated by schoolchildren, who give thank-you cards to their teachers. Some high schools have Valentine's Day dances. Classmates give themselves cards. These cards can be purchased in any store with famous cartoon characters. It is considered much more considerate to have children make handmade cards to give to friends and teachers.

Valentine's Day is also a great day to announce your love to someone as a secret crush. Some people even get married on Valentine's Day. However, you don't have to be in love to participate in the festivities. You can say ""Happy Valentine's Day"" to friends and coworkers.
Valentine's Day is not an official holiday though in the United States, which means government offices and schools are open as usual. The date used to be the celebration of a saint named Valentine who supposedly saved the life of a young woman. It wasn't until the Middle Ages that romance somehow got mixed up with the date and lovers sent handwritten love notes. Back then you couldn't go to the store and buy a card like now.
You know Valentine's Day is just around the corner when stores start decorating with red and pink hearts and Cupid's symbol, an ancient winged Roman god said to hit people's hearts Now it looks like Cupid goes straight after his wallet because he will also see many more jewelry ads as Valentine's Day approaches.",B2
"Six Uighurs who were imprisoned in the Guantánamo Bay detention center, Cuba, were transferred on Saturday to the South Pacific Island nation of Palau, the Department of Justice said.
Ahmad Tourson, Abdul Ghappar Abdul Rahman, Edham Mamet, Anwar Hassan, Dawut Abdurehim and Adel Noori were resettled in Palau, the Department of Justice said in a statement on Saturday.
Seven Uighurs remain at Guantanamo Bay, where 215 prisoners remain. Uyghur is an ethnic group in western China.
Since January, 25 detainees have been transferred to other countries.
The United States has coordinated with Palau to ensure that transfers are carried out with appropriate security measures and will continue to consult with the Republic of Palau on individuals, the Department of Justice said.
The 13 Uighurs were accused of receiving weapons and military training in Afghanistan. Some of them have been released since 2003, and others Uighurs have been released in other countries. The United States said it would not send them back to their homeland because of concerns that they would be tortured by the Chinese authorities.
The Chinese government has said that no returned Uighur would be mistreated and has repeatedly warned other countries against the taking of men. Beijing officials again urged the United States this summer to hand over all remaining Uighurs instead of sending them elsewhere.
China claims that the men are part of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, a group considered by the United States Department of State as a terrorist organization operating in the Xinjiang region. East Turkestan is another name for Xinjiang.
On October 20, the Supreme Court provisionally undertook to accept an appeal from the 13 Uighurs to be released in the United States from U.S. military custody.

"Most of the artistic directors first day leading a new ballet company is about meeting the dancers. But for Nacho Duato it's a challenge to find the rehearsal room.
The labyrinthine corridors of the magnificent Mikhailovsky Theatre in St. Petersburg are confusing and inspire some twists and turns without Duato's chronology before he finally identifies the right room and his new company, the 140 dancers of the Mikhailovsky Ballet.
It is unlikely that the stage plan will be the last challenge for the Spanish choreographer who, this month, took over the company's leadership.
He is the first foreigner to lead a Russian ballet company in more than a century and has been charged with bringing modern choreography to Mikhailovsky's classical repertoire.
“Looking at the past but always taking a step forward and walking into the future... this is what I think they want and that’s why I think they called me,” Duato said. I think they're clear they want to change; they want something new.
A modern ballet dancer and choreographer with an international pedigree, it is expected that he can revitalize the ballet for the Russian public. While performances at Mikhailovsky are well attended, there is growing concern that Russians will tire of seeing the standard repertoire of classical ballets.
Russians love ballet. That goes without saying, but the attitude towards Russian ballet in the West is more passionate, said Vladimir Kekhman, a multimillion dollar fruit importer and director general of the Mikhailovsky Theatre.
I would like us to have the same attitude in Russia because as we say we do not treat what we have until it is gone.I consider ballet a national treasure, he added.
Kekhman is a relatively recent convert to ballet, but he has become something of a cultural entrepreneur, investing $45 million of his own money to restore the buildings of Mikhailovsky and, hopefully, his reputation.
Kekhman needed new talent to oversee his vision and for that, he said, he had to look beyond Russia.
I looked inside our industry to see who were considered living legends of choreography, and when I looked inside Russia, I realized that we didn't have choreographers who had the ability not only to choreography, but also to run the company, he said.
He approached Duato, a non-Russian speaker, who has spent the last 20 years choreographing new works as Artistic Director of the Spanish National Dance Company.
At first Duato was reluctant to change direction towards classical ballet. But then Mikhailovsky offered him the opportunity to take modern choreography to a classical ballet company and proved to be too tempting an offer to put aside.
“I know a lot of people who think that he is crazy, that I am crazy and that this is never going to work,” Duato said. That this mixture is like a bomb, an atomic bomb. But it made me feel like we're gonna try, let's do it. Why not? Maybe we can do it.
Bringing a modern approach to ballet in Russia, where it is rooted in culture could numb some, but it is a task that Duato is enjoying.
It's not a pressure. It's a pleasure. It really is a pleasure to be in a place where ballet - LRB- has been -RRB- part of the cultural tradition for -LRB- a -RRB- a long time, and at the same time they want to break in and do new things, said Duato.
Duato has set himself a challenging calendar, choosing three dancers to create a ballet so new that it doesn't even have a name yet. They have weeks before the world premiere.
The main dancer Ekaterina Borchenko is the jewel of Mikhailovsky's imperial crown. The company's star dancer has danced leading roles in classical ballet productions such as Swan Lake, Giselle and La Sylphide.
Now, she's enjoying the opportunity to stretch her skills. In this repertoire, I can show a different side of myself, express myself differently and find something new in me, he said.
The opening night will be a test of fire of how receptive the Russians are to this new direction.
Duato believes that ballet is a living organism, which needs to evolve constantly to keep the audience interested. It's a philosophy he shares with Kekhman.
“Together we will work on something,” Duato said. We don't know what it's gonna be like, but I think it's gonna be beautiful. If we put all our hearts and soul into it, it's going to be fantastic.

"One of the most historic and significant milestones in the United States is the San Francisco cable car system. It is the only manually operated cable car system in the world. It is run by the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency. The system dates back to 1878, when the California Street line was first opened. In total, there are three lines currently operating in the city, and it has a fleet of 12 cable cars. There were 23 lines in use throughout the city connecting the various communities that make up San Francisco. Outdoor cars are an important tourist attraction, and are still used by San Francisco travelers on a daily basis.

The simple reason why the cable cars were used for the first time in the city was because of its landscape. San Francisco is very mountainous, which makes it impossible to climb municipal buses. The solution to this problem was the cable car. These cars are literally pulled by cable, climbing up and down the steep hills of the city, making it easier for people to get from one end of the city to the other.
There are two types of cars in use today. Single end cars and double end cars. Single end cars have open side sections with seats facing out onto the street. The rear section of these cars is closed with seats facing inwards of the car. These cars can accommodate 29 passengers. They travel in both directions using a swivel-based swivel that rotates the car at the end of the line. Double end cars are a little larger, and can contain up to 68 passengers. It has 34 seats and handles for another 34 passengers standing. The best feature of these cars is the pure fun they are to ride. The people who ride the San Francisco cable cars are entering part of California's history.",B2
"By entering the parking lot of the city's largest supermarket, Joe could already see that it was going to be a challenge to find parking this Saturday morning. He decides first to leave his wife Melissa, so that she can have an advantage in the purchases they need to make. Meanwhile, fight to find a free place among the multitude of other waiting cars.

Inside, Joe finally finds Melissa, whose cart is already loaded with packs of snacks and organic drinks. She knows Melissa is easily tempted by fantasy words that promise health benefits. It makes you feel good to know that you are making healthy decisions. In the past, Joe tried to reason with her, explaining that health is not about consuming specific articles, and more about the general lifestyle. Today, he simply decides to move on. As a family chef, Joe waits every week for the process of selecting meats and vegetables, imagining all the ways he can taste them and cook them. Free samples are offered at known locations – Melissa makes sure to reach all stations. They agree that chicken sausage is their favorite and buy two packs. Fresh pasta ""buy-one-get-one-free"" attracts Joe, while selling cheesecake attracts Melissa.
While waiting in line to check, Melissa examines your overflowing shopping cart and realizes that they are on budget. She puts back the appetizers and drinks that were clearly impulse shopping, and happily claims she is learning to be a great buyer! Joe can only smile at the expression on his face. Five months ago, when they first married, he never imagined that he would enjoy these Saturday morning food trips. Now, he finds in them a peaceful satisfaction, a welcome change in his work all week.",B2

"In a bold operation worthy of a film, three men escaped from a Canadian prison by helicopter, provoking massive persecution, authorities said.
The men escaped from a detention center on Saturday night in Quebec City.
A helicopter landed briefly in the courtyard before taking off with the three prisoners, said Ann Mathieu, spokesman for Quebec Provincial Police.
We are talking closely to the detention center to find out exactly how the escape occurred, Mathieu told CNN partner CBC. The priority... is to find the helicopter.
A hunt is underway for Yves Denis Yvon Lamontagne, 35, Denis Lefebvre, 53, and Serge Pomerleau, 49.
The first two men were arrested in a drug bust in 2010 and were awaiting trial. Police found guns, dozens of cars, and a plane during the arrest, he said. No information was provided on the third suspect.
It marks the second blatant escape from jail in Canada in just over a year.
In March 2013, two men posing as tourists seized a helicopter from a Canadian travel company, ordered the pilot to fly over a detention centre near Montreal, hoisted two inmates on the plane in the air using cables and left with a zip.
It was a real moment James Bond, witness Francis Emond said about last year's escape from the facility in Saint-Jerome, northwest of Montreal.
Although airborne leaks are spectacular, they are not unprecedented.
Albanian prisoner Alket Rizaj twice left a maximum security prison in Greece in 2006 and 2009.
On both occasions, the accomplices entered the prison courtyard by helicopter. The inmates boarded with rope stairs.
On both occasions, Rizaj was recaptured.
Last year, another prison escape in Greece tried to use the same tactic.
But the plot was thwarted when the prisoner was shot and the helicopter was forced to land in the prison parking lot.
In 1971, Joel David Kaplan escaped from a Mexican prison aboard a helicopter. The flight of the New Yorker inspired the book The 10 Second Jailbreak: The Helicopter Escape of Joel David Kaplan and the 1975 film Breakout.
And in France, Pascal Payet did not escape once, not twice, but three times from French prisons.
Every time, he was recaptured.

"Who says adult parties have to be boring? More and more adults are reliving their childhoods or creating memories that they did not have as children by having themed parties for their birthdays or other occasions.
Themed parties are based on an idea, a TV show, a fictional character, or really anything. Sometimes guests are expected to dress up according to the theme as well. For example, Toga's party is a kind of themed party where guests are expected to dress with robes, really just white sheets. Toga parties used to be especially popular with college students. At a costume party, everyone wears a mask and has to guess who's behind it. The mystery is part of the fun. Speaking of mystery, there are mysterious parts of murders, where guests have to solve a fake murder. Some adults throw seasonally based parties. A summer party on the beach, for example, could include guests wearing their swimsuits. Another popular type of themed party is the game night party. At this type of party, people gather to play several board games. A variation of the game's night party is the casino party, where adults play typically found games in a casino-like blackjack or poker.
Another thematic part could focus on a specific region or country. For example, a Mexican theme party could include tacos, colors of the Mexican flag and Mexican music. However, guests should be careful when dressing for this type of themed parties. Dressing as a particular ethnic or racial group is generally considered offensive. It is better simply to enjoy the food, and not to portray a stereotype.",B2
"The religious or civil ceremony that legally makes people a marriage is only part of the royal wedding. After the wedding comes the reception. A wedding reception is a party that is held immediately after the marriage ceremony. There is usually a little time, about an hour, between the ceremony and the reception to give people enough time to travel from the place of the ceremony to the location of the reception. Most wedding receptions are held in a catering room, which is a place specializing in organizing great parties. However, wedding receptions can be held in restaurants, parks and even in museums or zoos. A wedding reception is usually not held in the same place as the ceremony, but sometimes they do.

When guests arrive at the reception, boyfriends are usually not there to meet them. Right after the ceremony, the newly married couple, bridesmaids and godparents will go somewhere to take pictures. While this is happening, guests are usually treated at a cocktail hour at the reception site. Appetizers and drinks are served during this time. This also gives guests the opportunity to socialize. After cocktail time, the main dining room opens. At a wedding reception the seats are generally pre-established. Each guest will receive a card telling them where they are expected to sit. The tables are organized by numbers. In front of the reception room, there is a special table for grooms.
Once everyone is seated, waiters start serving salad or bread and drinks. Some receptions have an open bar, which means that alcohol is free. Other receptions have a box bar, which means that non-alcoholic drinks are free; guests are expected to pay for their own alcoholic beverages.",B2
"There may not be more Americans than George Washington. Washington became the first president of the United States in 1789 with its unanimous victory in the first American elections. He was also unanimously elected to a second term in 1793, the only president to obtain 100% of the electoral votes. Washington was also the Commander-in-Chief of the First Continental Army who fought the British when the country had not yet established itself.

Its epic ""Crossing of the Delaware"" river to recover New York City is still considered one of the largest military movements in the history of war. By the time of the crossing, the British had taken Boston and New York. The Continental Army was running away and disorganized, but Washington had a plan. He decided to take his troops across the Delaware River in the middle of winter. This was a movement that many military minds thought impossible, but not Washington. The Americans were able to take New Jersey, and change the course of the war.
Another historic moment for Washington was winter in Valley Forge. In 1777, Washington led an army of more than 11,000 soldiers to Valley Forge in Pennsylvania, where the army suffered during a cold winter that claimed the lives of 3,000 men. When spring came, instead of a group of demoralized and beaten soldiers, the army emerged ready for battle, and able to continue the fight against the English in New York. The army was able to survive the ferocious winter due to the training and preparation of Washington officials. Washington earned the nickname, ""The Father of His Country,"" because of its military intelligence, and its concern for the people of the United States.",B2

Hello, Meena.
Thank you so much for offering to sit down next week. I'm just sorry we don't catch up properly until we get back from our journey. Anyway, this is all I won't have time to tell you Saturday morning.
The alarm code is 7957. Don't forget to put it on when you go out and remember to turn it off when you come home as it's LOUD!
Rabbits need to feed once a day and under no circumstances should they be allowed to leave their cage in the garden as the neighbor's cats have attacked them in the past.
Please, can you use the washing machine during the day just because it is old and noisy and the neighbors complain otherwise?
Would you mind opening all the windows upstairs for an hour in the morning when the house gets wet this time of year?
That's it! You'll find everything you need in the house, and you'll help yourself to anything in the fridge or closets. Feel free to call or send a text message if you have any problems/questions.
See you briefly to deliver the keys on Saturday morning and looking forward to a proper chat when we return!
Thank you again!

"Emmanuel Limal, serial dater, was tired of meeting women who were not ready to form a family, or at least did not admit that they were. The 43-year-old actor, originally from France, had spent 20 years living in Copenhagen and seeking love in the hope of raising children. He recently took his online search, but was dismayed by the results.
“I was frustrated that everyone tried to sell themselves as really active, always traveling or with a long list of hobbies, but not to mention the children,” Limal said. “In some places, there was an option to click, saying, ‘I would like children someday,’ but you would read the person’s profile and think, ‘You’ll never have time!’ If someone goes to the gym eight times a week and travels every month, they won’t put a family first.”
Limal has a six-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, but coming from a large family – her father is one of 11 – she has always wanted more children. “It seems like I couldn’t meet anyone willing to give priority to forming a family and struggled with when to mention that I wanted to have children at any time that I knew someone new. It’s the ultimate taboo for dating,” he said. “Then one day I read a profile of a 38-year-old girl who said she knew it was really bad to admit it, but she wanted to have children. And I thought, ""You shouldn't be ashamed of this. '""
Limal remodeled his apartment to finance the creation of Babyklar.nu – or 'it's ready for the baby' in English. It works as a normal dating site, but every potential dating person is asked to be honest about their desire to start a family soon. “We ask people if they’re okay with someone who already has children, as well as if they want another baby,” Limal said. “But we don’t make them specify how many children they would like. That would be a little too much like online grocery shopping.”
The response to the site has been overwhelming, he said. “We had 50 registrations per hour when we launched in June and we are already listening to couples who have gathered through the site and are now together. I am fully waiting for the first baby Babyklar.nu for next summer.” More men have enrolled than women (53% to 47%), with testimonies such as “It’s so lovely to be able to say this out loud” and “Finally I dare be honest about what I want.”
The site has arrived at an opportune time for the country of five million people. According to a report from the Rigshospitalet Hospital in Copenhagen, Danes are not having enough babies, and the current rate of 1.7 children per family is not enough to support the population of Denmark. The usual suspects are being blamed for the new bass – the women who leave it “too late” and the couples who cohabit and wait to form families.
“Now, I hope, men and women who want to form a family but have not met the right person will still have another choice,” says Limal. He is interested to note that this is not just about baby - raising: “I want this to be about children and love. My goal is to match people who really want a family and a partner – and who will stay together. I am a romantic of heart.”
There are plans to launch the site in France and the UK later in 2013, but for now it is the Danes who are reaping the benefits. “The Danes have no problem having children before marriage so things can move quickly and, because the country is so small, a jutlander can go out with a Copenhagener without traveling too much,” Limal said. Besides, Limal has finally found love. “I’ve met a nice woman and she wants a baby too, so we’ll see.”

"-LRB-CNN-RRB- As one of the world's leading financial capitals, Hong Kong is a dream destination for business travelers.
With more skyscrapers than any other city in the world and some of the best restaurants on the planet, the city could well leave you begging for a flight cancellation so you can squeeze on an extra day.
To help you enjoy some of the highlights of the city, here is a guide to get into the city, eat and sleep well, buy the best memories and go out with an expense account you'll be proud of.
Easier and more comfortable airport transfer
Forget everything you know about subways: Hong Kong Express Airport Train Service makes even the most tired traveler fly.
The trains are clean, comfortable, spacious, always on time and take you to the city in 24 flat minutes, faster than any car service can aspire.
Better yet, trains are easy to walk and the simple procedure to find out on arrival -- there is virtually no stress about how to get tickets or where to get trains on leaving the arrival terminal.
At HK$100 per trip, trains depart at intervals of 10 minutes from 5:54 a.m. to 11:28 p.m. and 12 minutes from 11:28 p.m. to 12:48 a.m. every day.
Memorable meals
There is no shortage of Michelin-starred restaurants in Hong Kong.
But finding a memorable local meal that you'll be thinking about for months is much harder.
Luk Yu Teahouse has it all: a historical sensation inspired by deco art, waiters who have stayed in place over decades, murderous Cantonese food is nowhere else to be found, a glamorous clientele and a history past that includes a massive blow to the dining room.
You'll have to come early for an old-fashioned dim sum breakfast, like duck and chestnut pastry.
Luk Yu Teahouse, Luk Yu Building, 24-26 Stanley St. Central; +852 2523 1970
Central room with views
For a real home-out-of-home feeling, the attic suites at The Upper House are a good choice.
With over 180 square meters of discreet elegance, enveloping views of Hong Kong and a spa-inspired bathroom, this is the ultimate stay in the city.
Additional feature: the possibility of colliding with a celebrity in elevators.

Where to get a unique addition to your wardrobe
Hong Kong's fashion design scene is young, eclectic and fun.
A place to taste it is K11 Mall, known as Art Mall for its support of Chinese contemporary art and renowned gallery in the basement.
The shopping centre houses local designer brands and offers its own selection of design products at the K11 Design Store.
K11, 18 Hanoi Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon; +852 3118 8070
Where to take a murder photo
Of course, you can ride the historic Tranvía Peak with tourists and take a big picture of Hong Kong on top of Victoria Peak -- it's infallible.
But you could also join the local hikers - LRB- of which there are many -RRB- to walk to Pico Lion Rock through the most incredible panorama of Kowloon, all surrounded by pristine nature.
Experience the heart of the city
To see Hong Kong, past and present, in short, go to the Central Districts and Sheung Wan.
Some of the oldest parts of the city, with ruined colonial-era housing buildings and decades-old shops, can be found in these areas.
Gentrifying comfortably, Soho and Poho - LRB- the neighborhood between Po Hing Fong and Hollywood Road -RRB- areas offer thoughtful restaurants and unpretentious boutiques.
General Directions: Keep walking west along Queen's Road Central, or the Hollywood Road parallel.
Graham Street is where things start to get interesting.
Souvenir elegant and easy to pack
Some of the best memories that visitors take out of Hong Kong focus on food.
To bring some local flavor home, you can pick up a couple of bottles of XO sauce.
Each restaurant that deserves its reputation will have its own secret recipe for the slightly spicy local seasoning made of dry and often precious seafood as well as Chinese ham.
We love the one from the East Mandarin cake store -LRB- $35, small, $45, big jar -RRB-.

"An ultra-marathon trying to run from Florida to Bermuda in an inflatable human motor bubble was rescued on Saturday morning after he pointed out for help, the Coast Guard said.
Reza Baluchi, according to its website, has set itself the goal of running through more than 190 recognized nations to foster world peace. CNN released a story about him in 2012.
The Coast Guard first met Baluchi on Wednesday after receiving a report about a man in a bubble off the Miami coast, disoriented and asking for directions from Bermuda, a coastal guard press release said. It wasn't clear when he started his search.
A coast guard found Baluchi. Officials described the ship as a bubble of hydroelectric stem and a man on a 2013 YouTube video called a Baluchi bubble a big hamster wheel. He moved on the ground as Baluchi ran inside.
In the press release, the Coast Guard said Baluchi had protein bars, bottled water, a GPS and a satellite phone. The Coast Guard conveyed the dangers of the trip and asked Baluchi to leave his trip because he did not have enough supplies. But he wouldn't abandon his ship, the officers said.
The Coast Guard monitored his progress and on Saturday morning an exhausted Baluchi activated his personal location beacon, the Coast Guard said.
A coastal guard HC-130 aircraft and an MH-60 helicopter, along with the Maersk Montana vessel, were sent to rescue Baluchi 70 nautical miles east of St.Augustine, the Coast Guard said.
He was exhausted and taken to the Coast Guard air station in Clearwater, where his medical condition was assessed. No injuries were reported, the Coast Guard said.
Part of his effort was to make world peace, but he was trapped in the Gulf Stream, said Coast Guard public affairs specialist Mark Barney. The chances of exiting the Gulf Stream were quite low.
Baluchi could not be contacted for comments, but a video posted on Baluchi's Facebook page described his plans to travel in the bubble across the Caribbean, as well as his other athletic exploits.
CNN.com's story quoted Baluchi as saying he would cross the United States twice and around its perimeter once. He fled Iran to escape persecution, he said. He's an American citizen now.
“Reza doesn’t listen to anyone,” Davis Hyslop, a businessman and one of Baluchi’s supporters said in the 2012 story. He has these disproportionate ambitions that he puts in his mind. It's a success above anyone's expectations. It's almost biblical. But you have to be a little crazy to make such an effort, right?

"Baseball is the oldest major league sport in the United States today. With the growing popularity of football and basketball, baseball must now share the leading role in these sports. By the late 1990s, baseball was in trouble. The assistance had fallen. High-profile sports that had fast action like football and basketball were stealing the thunder from baseball. That was all before Barry Bonds and a couple of other batters took the game downtown.

Bonds played the first part of his career with the Pirates of Pittsburgh, where he enjoyed moderate success. After being transferred to the Giants of San Francisco in 1992, Bonds began a second race that put him in the spotlight for the right and wrong reasons. At a time when most players begin to decrease in performance due to their advanced age, Bonds was in a tear of home run that was unprecedented in the history of the game.
Bonds never hit more than 34 home runs in a year for the Pirates, but, playing for the Giants, he hit an amazing 73 home runs in 2001. This shattered a record that had been standing for 40 years. Bonds was 38 years old at the end of the 2001 season, and many questioned how he could put numbers like that. The answer to that question arose years later when Bonds was accused of taking illegal drugs that improve performance. Bonds eventually broke Henry Aaron's record for most home runs in a race, but many baseball purists feel that the record is stained by illegal drug use.
Bonds' career after baseball has been damaged due to drug use, and Major League Baseball has implemented a drug use policy since his retirement. He was charged by a federal grand jury on perjury charges for lying about his drug use, but was able to reach an agreement to stay out of jail. In any case, his legacy gets dirty forever.",B2
"Fires are destructive. They also create changes. In 1871 a fire burned most of Chicago. Many people think the fire started when a cow threw a gas lamp. Most of the city at that time was built of wood. This, combined with the famous Chicago winds and a drought, caused the city to burn quickly. The fire lasted three days. 100,000 people were left homeless and at least 300 were killed. What was surprising was the speed with which the city was rebuilt, eventually becoming the third most populated city in the United States.

The Boston Great Fire of 1872 created a $73.5 million property damage, more than any other fire in U.S. history. Most of downtown Boston and the financial district were set on fire in the fire that started in a basement in a warehouse. 30 people died, and thousands lost their jobs and homes. However, the city was rebuilt in two years. He began to enforce building regulations because of the fire.
The 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist factory fire in New York City caused the fourth largest loss of life by an industrial accident in U.S. history. 123 women and 23 men, all garment workers and mostly poor immigrants, died from fire, smoke inhalation or fall or jump to death. Child labour was not uncommon. The youngest victims were two 14-year-old girls working at the factory. So many people died because the factory owners closed the doors to the stairs and exits. This was to prevent workers from taking breaks and stealing. As a result of the fire and the huge loss of life, many people began to protest against poor working conditions. The United States Congress passed laws that improve the safety conditions of factories. The workers also formed a union to fight for better working conditions.",B2
"Every New Year, the city of Pasadena in California hosts a celebration to welcome the year with a series of events including the Parade of Roses. The parade takes place in the center of the city in Colorado Blvd, and features numerous floats, marching bands, equestrian teams, celebrities and honorees. It's the most popular parade in the country. It has given rise to several other New Year parades across the country. In Miami, it is the Orange Bowl Parade; in New Orleans, it is the Sugar Bowl Parade; in Arizona, it is called the Fiesta Bowl Parade. However, the Parade of Roses is the oldest and best parade. Many people like camping in tents or sleeping bags the night before to get the best places to see the Parade of Roses.

To cope with the cold, some people bring portable heaters to keep them warm. You can get to bass 40 at night in Pasadena during the winter, so many people dress hot for the occasion. Food is another great feature in celebrating New Year's Eve. People bring their portable grills to cook their favorite outdoor meals right on the sidewalk. The rich aroma of grilled food fills the night air, and most people are willing to share their food with other night campers. It's fun to try different dishes from other grills.
As the night turns into the morning, there is still electricity in the air. People are excited about the start of the parade, which starts at 8 a.m. sharp. The floats are beautifully decorated in flowers, while dancers and other artists dress in colorful costumes, some of which are made only for the parade. The marching bands come from nearby cities, high schools and universities. It is considered a great honor to participate in the Parade of the Roses.",B2
"Bob knew that the house he just bought was in a historically tough neighborhood. There was a gang violence story, including shootings, in the neighborhood. That's probably why the house was so cheap. The previous owners of the house had seized her. Then some fins of the house bought the property at a very cheap price, renovated it, raised the selling price, and sold it. Bob thought the house was still a good deal.

After moving, Bob began to see that many of the renovations to the house were merely cosmetic. While the house fins put new stainless steel appliances in the kitchen, the electrical work had not improved. This meant that every time Bob handled the dishwasher and the coffee machine, all the energy in the house went out. Bob spent over $1,000 to realign the house. The new carpets that the installed house fins were placed on the original wooden floors. Bob decided to rip off the ugly-colored oatmeal carpets and finish the old floors again. That was another $3,000.
The house was an old stucco house that was very hot in the summer and cold in the winter. The house fins installed some cheap windows. Bob hired a contractor to put in new double-glazed windows and install ceiling fans. That was another few thousand dollars. Bob wanted to make the house energy efficient, so he rented solar panels that were installed on the roof. This not only reduced their monthly electricity bill, but added value to the home.
In two years, all the changes Bob made to the house added up to over $20,000. At that time, the value of his house increased by almost $100,000. Bob felt like he made a good investment. I knew when I sold the house, I'd get more money than I paid for.

"At 6 a.m., the sound of the alarm clock pierces the air. Sandy crawls out of bed and starts her morning routine with a quick shower. After your shower, prepare a simple breakfast. Taking a clean bowl of the dishwasher, empty a pack of instant oatmeal in it. Pour into a cup of milk, stir and heat the mixture in the microwave. While waiting for her oatmeal to cook, she dresses for the day, conscious of time.

Fully dressed now, she removes oatmeal from the microwave, which has now cooled enough to suit her taste. It's her favorite flavor, apple cinnamon. As she savours every bite, she is reminded of her mother, who always made sure Sandy ate a hot breakfast before leaving the house in the morning.
Checking your phone time, you quickly swallow your last mouth full of oatmeal before you leave. As he walks down the street, a gust of wind blows his hair back. He covers his head with the hood of his coat, squeezes the scarf around his neck, and fastens himself to walk to the train station.
After settling on his seat on the train, his mother's memories are stirred again. She pulls out her phone and text messages: ""Hello mom, thanks for the scarf you knitted for me. It was very helpful this morning. ""Love always.""",B2
"Richard Milhous Nixon was the 37th president of the United States, and the only one to resign in the country's history. Born on January 9, 1913 in Yorba Linda, California, Nixon was a Republican Party member who served as Vice President under President Dwight David Eisenhower in the 1950s. Nixon ran for president for the first time in 1960, losing to the very charismatic and young Democrat, John F. Kennedy. The 1960 elections were one of the closest elections in history. Kennedy became one of the most popular presidents in history.

Despite his loss to Kennedy in 1960, Nixon rebounded in the 1968 election when he defeated Democrat Hubert Humphrey in a landslide victory. During the 1960s, the country was in a state of turmoil. The conflict in Vietnam was furious, the country was reeling over the murders of John F. Kennedy, and his brother Senator Robert Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr. Nixon the victory indicated that the country was ready for conservative leadership during these difficult times.
Nixon won the 1972 election over Democrat George McGovern in another crushing victory, which seemed to establish Nixon's legacy as a great president. Among his achievements was opening up trade with China, and his promise to end the conflict in Vietnam. However, Nixon would end up resigning from office just a year after his victory.
It was discovered that the Republican Party, with Nixon's knowledge, had secretly recorded the Democratic headquarters at the Watergate Hotel in Washington, D.C., during the weeks leading up to the election. Nixon tried to cover up the scandal, but the pressure was too great. Nixon was forced to resign in disgrace instead of being removed from office, which means being dismissed by the United States Congress. He became the first president to stop working in office.",B2
"Mother's Day is a feast that celebrates and honors mothers in the United States. It is celebrated on the second Sunday in May. It became an official holiday in the country at the beginning of the 20th century as a way to honor mothers whose children had died in the war.

The feast is celebrated in several ways. People give gifts to mothers like flowers, cards and jewelry to thank them for all their hard work. A popular symbol of the party is the carnation. This is because when the parties started in the United States people were encouraged to use a red carnation if their mother was alive or a white carnation if their mother was dead. Many people take their mothers to a special meal. In fact, Mother’s Day is the most popular date in the United States for people to go out to eat, and it is estimated that people spend billions on food and gifts. Mother's Day is also the most popular day for making long distance calls in the U.S. It's the second most popular gift day after Christmas.
Since its creation, Mother's Day has been criticized for being highly commercialized. In fact, the founder of the American party, Anna Jarvis, began to protest and was even arrested for disturbing the peace for demonstrating. Jarvis' own mother began the campaign to establish a mother's vacation during the American Civil War.
Mothers are not the only people celebrated on this day. All maternal figures including grandmothers, great-grandmothers, stepmothers and foster mothers are honored on holiday. In schools many students make special gifts, including hand-made cards. Although widely recognized, Mother's Day is not a federal holiday. Many other countries around the world have their own version of Mother's Day.",B2
"President Bush's chief adviser on national security is resigning after four and a half years at work, the White House said Monday.
Fran Townsend served more than four years as a national security adviser.
National Security Advisor Fran Townsend delivered her letter of resignation to President Bush on November 6 and will be looking for new opportunities outside the government.
I will take another job doing 20 hours a day, but this time in the private sector, Townsend said, who has spent 25 years working on law enforcement and government.
Bush praised Townsend's work on Monday.
Fran has always given wise advice on how to better protect the American people from the threat of terrorism, Bush said in a statement. Today we are safer because of your leadership.
Townsend's work, as the president's chief adviser in the fight against terrorism, included identifying terrorist groups around the world and assessing their threat, and finding ways to track and cut their funding. He said that experience should also be useful in the private sector.
Townsend, a mother of two children, aged 6 and 12, said she will first study the possibility of speaking in public, writing and working on the board of directors before looking for opportunities in global risk management for a large multinational corporation or financial institution. See how Townsend is planning to use his skills
He said he's been talking to the president about his planned departure for eight months.
Townsend's name had emerged during the recent search for the president of a new attorney general, but it was not considered. He said not getting the job had absolutely nothing to do with his decision to leave.
She said Bush wanted him to stay in his administration.
It was a difficult decision as I have loved and I will appreciate every minute of my service, he said in an email. My family actually advocated for me to stay and has always supported my service, so this was totally my decision.
Townsend is part of the search committee to find a replacement early next year. The president appoints the high-level post, and does not need confirmation from the Senate. E-mail to a friend

"Angelina Jolie was on stage on Thursday, but she wasn't acting. Instead, he paid tribute to the millions of uprooted people around the world who were left homeless by the war.
Angelina Jolie said host countries can learn how refugees survive their difficulties.
A United Nations goodwill ambassador, Jolie, was in Washington to observe World Refugee Day, an annual event that falls on Saturday this year. The moving ceremony was sponsored by the United Nations Refugee Agency.
Tears flowed as refugees and displaced persons shared their terrible experiences and defenders recounted what they had seen in refugee camps.
I think we should convince the world that refugees should not be seen simply as a burden, he said. They're the survivors. And they can put those qualities at the service of their communities and host countries.
Jolie spoke of her visits to refugee camps in Tanzania and Pakistan.
He met a 15-year-old boy in a Tanzanian refugee camp who, without a wheelchair, had to crawl since he was paralyzed by a shot in the back. His family was killed, leaving him orphaned. However, when she spoke to her, she did so with a smile.
He had a truly remarkable and unwavering spirit, she told Anderson Cooper of CNN after the event at the National Geographic Museum.
I think about him and I can't complain about anything... he was grateful and he had nothing and he suffered everything.
The boy died a few months after she met him, Jolie said.
According to a study by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees on displacement trends in 2008, there were 42 million uprooted persons: 15.2 million were refugees, 26 million were internally displaced persons and 827,000 were asylum-seekers.
Afghans and Iraqis constitute almost half of all refugees worldwide. One in four refugees was from Afghanistan, and 69 countries accepted Afghan refugees for asylum, finding agency officials.
Jolie counted her meeting with a pregnant Afghan refugee.
He lived in a small homeless house in an abandoned refugee camp in Pakistan and could not leave with others because he was too advanced in his pregnancy.
Pakistan struggles with the world's largest refugee population, about 1.8 million, according to the United Nations. The country also has more than 2 million internally displaced persons, largely due to fighting between the Pakistani army and the Taliban since April.
Antonio Guterres, head of the UN refugee agency, explained the plight of displaced persons at the event.
He said that internally displaced persons face the same situation - LSB - as refugees - RSB. They've lost the same thing as the refugees. They do not have the same international protections granted to refugees.
Conflicts such as those in Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Somalia have caused more people to flee their homes, although the number of displaced persons decreased by about 700,000 in 2008, according to the report.
Recent fighting in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia last year resulted in a total displacement of 1.5 million and 1.3 million people, respectively. According to the report, more than 2 million internally displaced persons are in the Darfur region of the Sudan.
When a genocide directed against Tutsi in Rwanda in 1994 subsequently spread to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rose Mapendo, Tutsi, was captured in the middle. She spoke at the event and described her ordeal.
Mapendo, her husband and seven children were thrown into an extermination camp, where her husband was executed and her children starved, she said with tears.
While in prison, she found out she was pregnant. “She gave birth in silence, on a concrete floor,” Mapendo said. To her surprise, she had twins, and to her surprise captors, she named her newborns after them. Shortly after his gesture toward the prison commanders, his family was released after his 16-month ordeal.
Mapendo, named CNN hero in October, created Mapendo International, a non-profit organization dedicated to identifying, saving and resettling endangered refugees. She was named humanitarian of the year at the event by the United Nations agency.
I want to encourage refugees not to give up, he said. Quitting isn't an option.

"No name evokes more controversy in the United States than O.J. Simpson. He has been at the U.S. spotlight for decades since he was a star football player at the University of Southern California, a top-notch academic university that is known primarily for its comprehensive and rich football tradition.

USC is one of the best places for future professional football players to start. Simpson knew that when he moved to school in the mid-60s at San Francisco Community College. At USC, Simpson found fame. His fortune was coming later. He helped the university reach the coveted Rose Bowl docking in 1968, after an outstanding 1967 season, where he led the nation in hasty yards. His 64-yard career against the archrival UCLA, in which many people say it was the best game in the history of college football, is what legends are made of. Simpson later played in the National Football League, where he gained more fame and fortune. When he retired, he went to an actor career where he starred in many commercials, and eventually films.
Unfortunately, Simpson's life took a tragic turn years later. He was accused of murdering his wife, and his friend in the early 1990s. His trial was one of the most seen events in television history. Simpson was acquitted of the murder, largely due to his ""Sleep Team"" of high-priced lawyers. A lot of people thought Simpson committed the murder and got away with it.
Simpson was later convicted in a Nevada court for several crimes, and is currently serving a prison sentence. Many believe that this conviction was a retribution for their previous crimes.",B2
"The last time he went on stage, the prototype of the mobile phone was subjected to his first tests. Thirty-five years later, as she acts again, singer Kate Bush faces a different world.
While most concerts now shine with phones and tablets, Bush is taking a stand against fans watching his shows through the digital veil of a screen.
Prior to his long-awaited concert series at Hammersmith Apollo in London, Bush released a statement appealing to his fans to lower their mobile phones at their concerts.
Bush wrote on his website: “I have a petition for all of you coming to the shows. We have purposely chosen an intimate theatre setting instead of a great place or stadium. It would mean a lot to me if you would please refrain from taking pictures or filming during shows.
“I want a lot to have contact with you as a public, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras. I know it’s a lot to ask for, but it would allow us to share the experience together.”
With his love of theatricality and opulent costumes, Bush's desire to stop uploading granulated images to YouTube fans could also be an attempt to keep the show a surprise for the thousands of fans who have bought tickets for the 22 dates he's playing.
Bush is not the first to speak out against the harmful effect of the presence of telephones at concerts, with numerous artists criticizing their fans for experiencing live music through a screen filter.
The Who front man, Roger Daltrey, recently said it was “rare” that people didn’t have their mind in the show when they had gone to a performance and were concentrating on looking at the screen instead of the artist on stage.
He said: “I pity you, I truly pity you. Looking at life through a screen and not being at the moment totally – if you're doing that, you're 50% there, right? It's weird. I find it odd.”
In 2013, Beyoncé rebuked one of his fans at a concert to film. “You can’t even sing because you’re too busy recording,” Beyoncé said. “I’m right in your face, baby. You have to take advantage of this moment. Put that damn camera down!""
The debate about the presence of phones in live events is not limited to music, with sports fans equally vocal on the subject. Recently, Dutch fans at the PSV Eindhoven launched a vehement protest against the introduction of wi-fi in their stadium, holding banners with messages such as “No wi-fi. Support the team, “You can sit at home” and “Stand united,” while Manchester United has also told fans to leave their “big electronic devices” at home, forbidding tablet filming this season.
Jarvis Cocker has previously criticized phone users in the audience for driving it “insane at concerts,” adding: “It seems stupid to have something going on in front of you and look at it on a screen that is smaller than the size of a pack of cigarettes.”
Johnny Marr said in 2013 that it meant that fans missed the sensory experience of live music in their desperation to document the event for later.
“Standing up and looking through your phone is a completely wasted opportunity. You know, I don't want to be unkind, but I think you should leave your phone because you're being an idiot, really. Just enjoy the concert,” he said.
“That’s one of the things about concerts – it’s taking what’s going on with people around you and, watching it on a small screen, it’s a waste of time.”
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes He resorted to putting a sign in one of his places, begging fans to bag his technology. He read: “Please don’t see the show through a screen on your smart device/camera. Keep it as a courtesy to the person behind you, and to the band.”
It has even leaked into the world of classical music, with one of the most important pianists in the world amazing concerts in June 2013, when it left the stage because a fan was filming its performance on a smartphone. Krystian Zimerman returned moments later and stated: “The destruction of music due to YouTube is huge.”
But Sam Watt of Vyclone, a telephone app that encourages the public to film at concerts and then gathers the images to create a video of the event, said such artists were fighting a lost battle and that filming at concerts improved rather than downplaying the experience.
“Fans filming is now part of the concert experience – that’s a fact – so we take that material that people are filming at concerts through the app, upload it to the app, and then go back to them mixed with everyone else they were filming. You end up with really fantastic content,” he said.
“Our general thinking is that filming at concerts adds up to the experience, instead of removing it, and I think if Kate Bush came to have a cup of tea, we could have a very interesting discussion about this and we could win it,” she added. “Knowing that people are going to film and want those memories is very important because it’s probably going to hit them in the head in the future if they tell everyone they can’t film. You have to accept it.”",B2
"When the sheriff's deputies arrested Casey Anthony in 2008 for the death of his 2-year-old daughter, few would have anticipated it would end like this: a few days after his trial, the jailers arranged a clandestine release by throwing Orlando's wife back into a world where her story could make her rich or put her life in danger.
But that's precisely the scenario that will develop one Sunday when Anthony finishes serving his sentence for four misdemeanors of cheating the police.
Anthony, 25, was acquitted on July 5 of charges of murder and abandonment of children in the death of his daughter, Caylee, whose skeletal remains were found in 2008 in a forest camp. She was convicted on four counts of deceitful police and sentenced to four years in prison.
After serving nearly three years in prison awaiting trial, he was ordered to be released this weekend.
The abrupt end of a criminal case that sometimes transfixed the nation resulted in anger and disgust, as well as donations of cash to his prison account. It has also led to speculation that the polarizing theme of the Facebook page I Odia Casey Anthony -- and the source of anger for her more than 40,000 fans -- could change her name and appearance and move to a faraway place.
If her lawyers are doing the right thing and they're doing their job, they're going to have to explain to her that there is a real hatred for her, that there have been death threats, that she can't walk among the population, said HLN legal collaborator Sunny Hostin. That's not just gonna happen.
Whatever he ends up doing, he has to get out of jail first.
Few details have been made public about how Anthony will be released from Orange County Prison, where he has been detained since his arrest in October 2008.
Court officials have given limited information to reporters, most plan to bring three journalists into a safe area of jail someday late on Friday or early Saturday and cut off outside access while awaiting Anthony's release.
When exactly Anthony will be released, it hasn't been made public.
That's partly probable because of the intense emotions that Anthony's release has generated.
I know it's bad for God to forgive me, but I hope someone wipes that smile off your face. With a Mack truck, he wrote a poster on Facebook page I Odia Casey Anthony.
Another poster, referring to lucrative interviews, books and movies, said that the only thing she would pay to see or read would be about Casey Anthony's body.
The page shows Anthony's photo with a target on his forehead under the headline Hey, Casey, I'd take care if I were you, just say.
A woman from Oklahoma said she has already faced the kind of anger Anthony can face when she is no longer behind the protective walls of Orange County jail.
Sammy Blackwell told CNN member KOTV that a woman who confused her with Anthony on July 8 ran over her car twice, turning it over.
She said I was trying to hurt babies, I was killing babies and she was going to stop it before it happened again, Blackwell told the station.
As it happens, Blackwell has a daughter named Caylee too, but that's the end of the similarities. He says he doesn't even look that much like Anthony and he cares about the women who do.
Sheriff Jerry Demings said Tuesday that investigators are assessing Anthony's security threats. Although he said that the department was not aware of any credible threat to his life, it is a concern that was clearly in his mind.
No one has the right to take the law into their own hands, he said. Casey Anthony had his day in court and the jury made a decision. I would expect people to step back and not go out and commit another crime.
It's also a concern for your lawyers.
I and other team members are concerned about your safety, much more, one of your lawyers, Dorothy Sims, told HLN.
What Anthony will do after his release is unclear.
“Well, if I knew right now, I’m sure you can appreciate that I wouldn’t tell you,” Sims said. I don't think that's settled. My hope for her would be that she would be left alone and that her privacy would be respected.
Hostin said on CNN that he has heard reports that Anthony will hide, live under a supposed name, or undergo plastic surgery.
But I think we're going to hear his story because people have already offered him a million dollars for his story, he said.
Anthony also has legal issues to deal with.
His criminal team is appealing his convictions for misleading the police, and is being sued in two separate actions in a civil court. One is presented by a woman with the same name Anthony gave to investigators as his daughter's nanny's name. The other involves a search party that wants Anthony to pay the expenses they incurred looking for Caylee.
Anthony can be offered money for book and movie deals, but an offer is not on the table.
Playboy founder Hugh Hefner told CNN's Piers Morgan that the magazine does not offer Anthony a drawing.
“I would not reward someone like that for what has happened,” Hefner said.
Attorney J. Cheney Mason, who once said he thought of Anthony as a granddaughter, said he doesn't know what life is waiting for his client, but he has hopes.
She's only 25 years old. Within a decade, hopefully, he'll have some stability in his life and maybe a husband, and they can be somewhere in Montana and start over, he said.

"In the typical bad boyfriend style, Dan Sullivan was late for breakfast with The Guardian because he was stopped on his motorcycle.
Sullivan works too hard, he says. He misses dinner dates. He forgets to give gifts.
And so, like apparently everyone in Silicon Valley, 27-year-old venture capital has come to a start-up to fix it: BetterBoyfriend.me, a service that sends brides and wives a gift every month for about $70.
Sullivan, who works in finance, has been quietly testing the program and has signed around 350 boyfriends who generate about $17,000 revenue each month. Most of the members, he says, are from his Harvard collection and investor friends: venture capitalists, founders and employees of companies like Apple, Google and Facebook, whose girlfriends have been receiving gifts from Sullivan for the past year.
Each month, Sullivan members choose from a list of seven possible gifts (chocolate, tea sets, manicures). The package is sent to the unmarked and unlabeled groom.
He tests his ideas by buying Facebook ads just to see what kind of traction they get. BetterBoyfriend. I left. “Best boyfriend hit something,” Sullivan said. “It’s a pain point that everyone has.”
BetterBoyfriend.me wasn't Sullivan's first idea. For a couple of days, he thought of a dog-sharing pitch: “I see all these rich guys looking miserable walking dogs and I realized: a dog is only a valuable 5% of the time,” he said. “So what if we have a guy who would take care of dogs and other people could rent them?”
Another start-up, called InvisibleBoyfriend, allows users to “design and build a credible social partner that is all you want and always available to talk, whenever you want.” The end result is a “boyfriend” who can send text messages with you all day.
Founder Kyle Tabor launched it to give users a fake boyfriend to dissuade unwanted advances, but he has found that people have grown attached to their algorithmic partners: “Many more users are looking for companionship through conversation rather than external 'proof' of a relationship to get people out of it.”
For Sullivan and Tabor, the surprise was the real relationships that have been formed with their clients. Sullivan says he's started looking at himself as some kind of relationship consultant for boyfriends.
Sullivan admits he's made mistakes. At first, the packages included receipts that had his name, Dan Sullivan. “One of the boyfriends wrote to me and said, ‘Listen, man, she’s not mad, but Cynthia found out.’”
About 50% of BetterBoyfriend.me women deliver packages to learn about their involvement in their relationships: “It is correlated with age. I think, after being married for a while, you don’t keep many secrets.”
And during the year, the young founder says he needs to know the boyfriends very well. They even gave birth in a delivery room in the hospital. The key, he said, is to remember that his relationship is with the groom.
The first time he launched his company, he attached labels that said BetterBoyfriend.me to bouquets of flowers and left for Dolores Park, a popular resting place in the Mission District of Technology and Youth.
“I looked for couples and gave the bouquet to the girl, but that didn’t go well with the boyfriend. No, not at all. It made sense, though. It was great,” he said. “So I reconsidered and started handing them over to the boyfriends.”",B2

The UC system has more than 230,000 students on its 10 campuses. It is considered the state's most prestigious system. It includes top universities such as UC Berkeley, and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Both schools are among the top 25 universities in the country, with Berkeley among the top 10. A title of the UC system is highly sought after, and academic standards are higher than the other systems. They're also more expensive.
California State Universities have 23 universities in their system. It is a diversified system that includes two polytechnic universities, and a maritime university. These schools offer professional and maritime education, but also offer traditional academic programs. The enrolment system is approximately 450,000 students, with some 45,000 faculty members.
The California Community Colleges system is the largest higher education system in the state and in the world. It has 112 campuses, and serves approximately 2.4 million students. It offers transfer degrees, vocational training and associated degree programmes.
California is also home to a large number of private and managed schools. These schools have no links to the state school system, but some accept the transfer of students from community universities. The state's most notable and prestigious schools are Stanford University, Palo Alto, and Southern California University, Los Angeles.",B2
"President Obama met on Monday all confirmed cabinet members for the first time as president and challenged them to cut $100 million in the next 90 days.
President Obama meets Monday with his cabinet, including Defense Secretary Robert Gates, on the right.
Agencies will need to report on how they saved on spending at the end of the period.
The federal government has a trust gap when it comes to the American people, Obama said in the White House.
We have to earn their trust. You have to feel confident that your dollars are being spent wisely.
The edict is part of Obama's commitment to go line by line through the budget to cut spending and reform the government, said a senior administration official.
A possible cabinet officer was missing from the meeting -- the Kansas government. Kathleen Sebelius, the designated secretary of health and human services. The Senate has not voted on whether to confirm Sebelius in office.
Obama made his call for savings as the House of Representatives and Senate returned from recess this week, ready to begin reconciling their versions of the 2010 fiscal budget resolution. The president's budget request is $3.67 billion. Observe how management expects to reduce costs
In the context of the federal budget, $100 million in savings is a small amount, critics said.
Any amount of savings is obviously welcome, said Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. But -LSB- $100 million is -RSB- about the average amount we will spend every day just covering the interest in the stimulus package we approved earlier this year.
Robert Gibbs, White House press secretary, insisted that, however, ordinary Americans would appreciate the savings effort.
Only in Washington, D.C., there's $100 million not much money, Gibbs said. It's where I'm from. It's where I grew up. And I think it's for hundreds of millions of Americans.
The administration also maintains that the order indicated an important demonstration of fiscal responsibility.
None of these savings alone will solve our long-term fiscal problems, Obama said. But taken together, they can make a difference, and they send a signal that we are serious about how the government works.
The White House provided examples of how agencies have already begun to implement cost-cutting measures, including:

"The remnants of tropical storm Lee settled in the center of the Atlantic and northeast on Wednesday, causing warnings of heavy rains and flash floods in areas from Washington to western New England, the National Hurricane Center said.
Several rounds of heavy rains are found in the reserve for much of the region over the next two days, with an additional forecast of 2 to 6 inches -- and in isolated cases up to 10 inches.
This comes on top of the heavy precipitation that has already fallen in the region when the storm, which exploded from the Gulf of Mexico, faced an extratropical low pressure system centered across the central Appalachian mountains and stagnated.
These rains can cause sudden floods and potentially deadly mud slides, the prediction center said.
A sudden flood warning for the District of Columbia remains in effect until midnight tonight, with harmful wind gusts and severe electrical storms also possible. A press release from the D.C. Homeland Security and the Emergency Management Agency urged people to avoid driving when possible, drive very carefully when driving, and stay alert for sharing water that cannot be driven through.
The previous Wednesday, the storm caused a series of delays in air traffic throughout the northeast. Several flights were delayed more than an hour in the New York metropolitan area and up to 55 minutes in Boston and Philadelphia.
The forecast was not welcome for Vermont and North New York, which could receive another 1 to 3 inches of rain with up to 4 inches possible in some places by Wednesday night.
We could flood again, Robin Stewart of Paterson, New Jersey, told CNN WCBS subsidiary. We're really worried about that.
The garbage remained stacked outside Stewart's house after Irene's flood shattered her lower level, WCBS said. Stewart hasn't had energy for more than a week, and he's afraid that more rain will flood his house again and keep it in the dark even longer.
When everyone is on their way to recovery, we are flooding again, Stewart said.
Some total storm rains in the northeast were recorded up to 5 p.m. Wednesday in Becket, Massachusetts -LRB- 8.11 inches -RRB-; Rockaway, New Jersey -LRB- 8.43 -RRB-; Phillipsburg, New Jersey -LRB- 7.9 -RRB-; and Forks, Bethlehem and Dover, Pennsylvania -LRB- just over 7 inches -RRB-.
Lee left at least four people dead as he crossed the southeast, throwing up to 12 to 15 inches of rain in many places.
In Gwinnett County, Georgia, outside Atlanta, firefighters said Tuesday they found the body of a man who drowned in a flooded stream near Norcross.
In Baldwin County, Alabama, police said they no longer believe a 16-year-old child is alive. The teenager was last seen on a beach near Gulf Shores on Sunday.
A flood death was also reported in northeastern rural Mississippi, where one person drowned after flood water swept a vehicle in Tishomingo County, emergency officials said.
And a woman was hit by a tree and killed in Chattanooga, Tennessee, early Tuesday.

"-LRB-CNN -RRB- Arsenal kept alive his low hopes of winning this season's English Premier League title by beating Burnley 1-0 in Turf Moor.
A first goal of half the Welsh international Aaron Ramsey was enough to separate the two sides and ensure Arsenal's retention in second place.
More importantly, the North London club took less than four points from Chelsea first, with the two clubs to play next week.
But Chelsea has two games in hand and plays humble Queens Park Rangers on Sunday, a team that is fighting the descent.
Good shape.
Arsenal has been in excellent shape since the beginning of the year, transforming what seemed to be another mediocre season struggling to secure fourth place, and with it the Champions League ranking, into one in which at least they have a chance to win the title.
After moving forward, Arsenal rarely looked in danger of yielding, showing more of the midfield pragmatism epitomized by the tastes of Francis Coquelin, who also played a crucial role in the goal.
It has been absolutely consistent in the quality of his defensive work, Arsenal Arsene Wenger's coach told Sky Sports after the game when asked about Coquelin's contribution to Arssenal's current career.
They have won eight games in a row since they introduced the young Frenchman previously overlooked in a more defensive position in the midfield.
He was a player who was with us for seven years, from 17, who is now only 24, Wenger explained.
Sometimes you have to be patient. I am very happy for him because he has shown great mental strength.
Now all eyes will be in next week's clash between Arsenal and Chelsea who will probably decide the title.
“They have the games in hand,” Wenger said, playing with his club’s title aspirations.
But we'll move on and that's why victory was so important to us today.
Downhill dog fight
Meanwhile, it was a good day for teams at the bottom of the league.
Aston Villa continued his good form since he named coach Tim Sherwood with a 1-0 win over Tottenham, who fired Sherwood last season.
The Belgian international Christian Benteke scored the only goal of the match, his eighth in six games, to ensure a vital three points to give the Midlands club breathing space.
Another Midlands club looking over its shoulders is West Brom, who granted a target injury time to lose 3-2 against the Leicester City back club.
But it was a horrible day for former Dutch coach Dick Advocaat, who saw his team lose 4-1 at home to Crystal Palace team.
Democratic Republic of Congo International Yannick Bolasie scored Crystal Palace's first hat trick in the Premier League to ensure an easy win.

"In general, the two pastel graphs show that smartphones and tablets are used for the same purposes, but in very different degrees.
The first circular graph shows how people spend their time on smartphones, while the second circular graph illustrates how time is spent on tablets. For both types of devices, the higher usage is for games, but the figures differ greatly. 57% of the time spent on a tablet is given to games, while only 35% of the time spent on a smartphone is used for this. In contrast, smartphone users spend 29% of their time on their social media access devices, compared to only 15% of tablet time devoted to the same activity.
The third most popular use of the tablet is to consume entertainment, with users spending 13% of their tablet time watching videos and listening to music. Smartphone users, however, devote only 8% of their smartphone time to this type of entertainment, preferring to spend 20% of their time in their phone access services. These may include maps, weather information, and calculators.
There is a clear difference in the way people are using their smartphones and tablets. In general, while tablets are used more for games and other forms of entertainment, smartphones seem to be the preferred choice for tasks as well as communication with the world around us.",B2
"Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of the most recognizable celebrities in the United States of America. The Austrian star arrived in the United States in the late 1960s, when it was an international star on the bodybuilding circuit. Since then, Schwarzenegger has had multiple careers as an actor, politician and philanthropist.

Schwarzenegger began training weight at the age of 15. By the time I was 20, I had won the prestigious title of Mr. Universe. Professional bodybuilding honor is awarded annually, but this was not your only bodybuilding title in your resume. He won seven titles of Mr. Olympia during his career as a bodybuilder. He also wrote several books on the subject. His bodybuilding career spanned from 1965 to 1980.
His film career began in 1970 when he starred in a little-known film called Hercules in New York. However, from these beginnings, Schwarzenegger cultivated a long and successful career as an action movie star in Hollywood. His films are some of the most popular films in the United States.His most recognizable role was possibly as Terminator in the series of films of the same name. After a long and successful film career, Schwarzenegger, who was always interested in politics, began a political career that culminated in his election to two terms as governor of California.
Schwarzenegger was elected governor for the first time in October 2003, running on a Republican Party platform. He enjoyed moderate success as governor in his early years, but fought long after that. He had many political opponents who cited that he had no political experience and that he had won the elections simply because of his popularity. Schwarzenegger's mandate was shaken by allegations of sexual misconduct that tarnished his political career. He remains a very popular cultural figure in the United States.",B2
"Van Halen is Rock ‘n’ Roll as Cadillac is to cars. It's one of the most popular bands in the country, and it's still strong 40 years later. It is known as one of the best bands in the history of a garage band background. Founded by brothers Eddie and Alex Van Halen at their home in Pasadena, California in 1972, the band was one of the best rock actors in the country, and is as popular today as it was then.

Eddie Van Halen is considered one of the best leading guitarists in the history of music by many of his colleagues, while Alex was a top drummer. Together they formed the core of the popular band that also included bass guitarist Michael Anthony and vocalist David Lee Roth. The brothers were born in the Netherlands and emigrated to the United States as children. The two were inseparable, and they developed an interest in music in the mid-60s. They formed the band in 1972, using the name Genesis. They later changed their name to Mammoth when Eddie discovered that Genesis was already in use. They finally renamed the band Van Halen.
According to popular legend, Van Halen was discovered by Gene Simmons of the rock band Kiss, while performing on Gazzarri's on the Strip, a popular place for heavy metal rock bands in the 1970s. They continued to perform in concerts throughout Southern California when they released their debut album Van Halen in 1978. The album peaked at No. 19 on the Billboard list, and the band never looked back. Van Halen's biggest commercial success was from 1978 to 1985, but his albums continue to sell. He has reaped a cult of followers from several younger generations of American Rock ‘n’ Roll fans.",B2
"David Cameron, Barack Obama and Pamela Anderson have refused. George W Bush, Benedict Cumberbatch and Stephen Hawking have participated. As the Ice Bucket Challenge added $100 million to an American charity against neuron disease and $4.5 million to a British organization, as well as thousands more to charities in Hong Kong and Australia, the cold water of a rapid reaction has quickly followed.
Famous narcissists exhibiting toned bodies, people having fun without donating, complaints about water waste – attacks have come from commentators, animal rights groups and environmentalists. And the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Association (ALS) of the U.S. – which is not related to the British MND Association – he was also criticized for the six-figure salaries paid to his senior staff.
Meanwhile, the challenge continues to grow. For anyone who doesn't know how it works, someone gives a brief speech to the camera about charity, then throws a bucket of ice in the water over his head, or gets a friend to do it, before proposing to three people to do the same or donate.
It started in the U.S. in July, though whether it was on a golf course or a baseball course depends on the version you prefer, and first appeared on American television on July 15. But the ALS Association has now been forced to withdraw an attempt to patent the phrase “Ice Cube Challenge” after criticism. “We understand the public’s concern and are withdrawing trademark applications,” said spokesman Carrie Munk. ALS has not yet responded to criticism of its high overheads and salary bills.
The unfortunate coincidence that August 31 to September 5 was World Water Week, with international delegates coming to Stockholm to discuss the global water crisis, has not been lost in some. The WaterAid charity is asking people to use recycled water from bathtubs or garden butts or to exhaust people with sea water.
Douglas Graham, director of fund-raising at the MND Association, said: “The reaction is to be expected, but, in reality, this is just a wonderful surprise and we are very grateful. We didn’t see it coming, but suddenly the donations just started.” The momentum is a huge help for a small charity that cares for the sick of a debilitating and misunderstood disease that has no cure and kills five people a day in the UK.
Former Baywatch star Pamela Anderson, a long-standing animal rights activist, wrote an open letter to the ALS Association, saying she could not support her record in animal experimentation. Some American stars have rejected the challenge due to California's drought. Actor Matt Damon managed to solve the problem by removing water from his toilets, noting that much of the world had less clean drinking water available. Actor Verne Troyer used milk, citing environmental reasons again. And the challenge has been blamed for causing a shortage of water on the Scottish island of Colonsay after its 135 inhabitants rose up in madness.
In Australia, a television presenter apologized for his robust “no thanks” response to being nominated. Lincoln Humphries had said: “Instead of pouring fresh water over your own head and wasting ice, here is a list of charities that help communities desperately need money around the world. I would like to nominate everyone, everywhere, who has more than they need, to donate what they can to people who need it the most... because that’s what charity is all about, not to put themselves through a mild discomfort with a bucket of ice water.”
Another criticism has been that small charities will not be able to cope with the extra money, but the MND Association rejected this. “Oh, we can cope here,” Graham said. “We finance world-class research on causes and, ultimately, to find a treatment or cure. We provide care and support to 3,500 people and they need it because this is a disease that progresses rapidly and is costly to manage. More than 50% die two years after diagnosis. It is heartbreaking to see the decline of the people we work with for a few months.”
But, for many people with a connection to the disease, the awareness that the challenge has created is as valuable as cash. Graham says it's priceless. Normally, the MND Association receives around 300,000 visits a year on its website. Recently, in one day, I was 330,000.
“We couldn’t have created this if we had tried. Charities are all worthwhile causes and I understand even that some people might want to donate to a different one. In 2013, the British gave £62 billion to charity – we should be proud of it. It's fabulous for us to get this unexpected effect. We will be sitting in the next few weeks to figure out how to spend it the best way, but, I assure you, every penny will count forever.”

If you've never eaten a brioche with fresh Ste. Maure goat cheese, honey and nuts for breakfast, then he hasn't been to the Loire, says Laurent Dutheil, who is justifiably proud of the simple breakfasts he serves at his 23-room hotel on the western corner of the valley.
Dutheil also produces dozens of fragrant handmade jams such as apple-lavender and quinceme. - LRB- Sadly, they're not for sale, but you can buy Dutheil's recipe book, Jam in the Cupboard. -RRB- The traditional foods adapt well to the venerable atmosphere of the hotel: Diderot is located in an extensive house of the fifteenth century that the Chinese Dutheil, together with his two sisters, Martine and Françoise, bought and renovated six years ago.

Dutheil addressed structural issues, taking care to keep intact the exposed oak beams and original stone walls, while his sisters remodeled the rooms with cheerful paper painted with stripes, toilet linen and 19th century cabinets that they collected on trips to Paris. The largest room, with capacity for four people, has double windows overlooking a patio. In the distance you will find vineyards full of the red grapes of Chinon dear to the novelist and satirist François Rabelais of the sixteenth century.

Château de l'Isle
The Château de l'Isle is quiet to the bottom, unless you count the chorus of charlatans coming from the duck pond on the 35-acre grounds. The 18th century manor house had been abandoned for 10 years when Denis Gandon bought it in 1986 and transformed it into a 12-room hotel.
However, the castle somehow feels like a private house: a portrait of Gandon's grandfather hangs on a 100-year-old table in the dining room, and a friendly Jack Russell terrier entertains guests with endless rounds of searching. The elegant rooms have exposed wooden beams and covered beds in crimson and calendula tones. Travel Budget: See the hotels

I grew up in the region, so when we made the decision to open our own place, I knew I had to go back to the Loire, says François. According to the spare design of the house, the decoration in the Auberge is simple -- the bedrooms are equipped with neutral suede sofas, blonde wooden floors and minimalist photographs of daisies and landscapes.

"Rangers scored three goals in the second half to beat Celtic 4-2 at Glasgow's Old Firm Derby Sunday and win four points in the Scottish Premier League.
Inform Steven Naismith that he shot Rangers with a hit after 22 minutes, but Celtic was quick to level Gary Hooper's goal 12 minutes later.
Celtic took the lead just before half-time when Ranger goalkeeper Allan McGregor allowed a faint shot from Moroccan Badr El Kaddouri to evade his grip and drip into the net.
But Nikica Jelavic went to the Rangers level seven minutes after the interval and were ahead when Kyle Lafferty became after 67 minutes.
Mulgrew, who was lucky enough to escape with just one yellow card for his first half challenge, then saw red in the 75th minute and Naismith took advantage of 10 men to score the fourth and his second in time of injury.
I didn't think there was much in the teams in the first half. I'm not sure we deserved to go down at 2-1, but that's what we're up against, Rangers Ally McCoist's manager told Sky Sports.
We asked the boys for a reaction in the second half and we got it.
Celtic manager Neil Lennon was disappointed with the second half of his team: we didn't compete and it was almost as if the players had gone out in the second half thinking that the game had been won, he said.
The matches between the two giants of Scottish football are often crucial in the national title race and the victory left Rangers at 19 points after seven games, with Celtic in 15 seconds.

"Saint Patrick's Day, March 17, is a Christian religious feast celebrating the patron saint of Ireland. According to legend, St. Patrick took all the snakes out of Ireland. St. Patrick's Day has also become, especially in the United States, a day to celebrate Irish culture. In the country's major cities, such as New York and Boston, there are parades and festivals. People dress in green and decorate with clubs, a type of three-leaf clover. Some people wear buttons or t-shirts that say, ""Kiss me, I'm Irish."" In the United States, St. Patrick's Day is not a legal holiday, which means government offices and schools are open.

The largest and oldest parade takes place in New York City. It actually started about 250 years ago before the United States was its own country. Every year thousands of people gather to see hundreds of Irish dancers and bagpipe players march. The Irish pass dance is done in groups or solo. The dancers make complicated movements with their feet and legs while keeping their upper bodies rigid. The parade has also been a source of controversy because the parade is associated with the Catholic Church in New York City; gay and lesbian organizations have not been allowed to march. Many people protest the parade or boycott it.
St. Patrick's Day has also been associated with the consumption of a lot of alcohol, specifically beer. A drink that is often seen around the holidays is ""Green Beer"". This is really just regular beer with green food coloring. Many people feel that parties celebrate stereotypes about the Irish, such as the myth that everyone likes to drink and get drunk. Others complain that holidays have focused too much on drinking, with public intoxication as a problem in the major cities around the holidays.",B2
"Sean Edwards, one of Britain's most promising racing drivers, has died in an accident at Queensland Raceway in Australia.
Edwards, 26, was the son of former Formula 1 driver Guy Edwards and played the role of his father in the film Rush.
Edwards led the drivers' championship in the 2013 season of Supercup Porsche Mobil 1 and participated in a private training session for young drivers.
The accident occurred when the Porsche 966 in which he was traveling as a passenger crashed into a tyre barrier.
Guy Edwards was one of three drivers who famously took Niki Lauda out of his car before he burst into flames after an accident at the Nurburgring during the 1976 German Grand Prix.
His son had followed him in the races and was highly qualified.
Condolences
Our thoughts are with his family and we would like to express our deepest condolences to his family, said Hartmut Kristen, Chief Motorsporter at Porsche.
Inspector Dave Preston of Queensland Police said emergency services had fought to get Edwards out of damaged vehicles.
The fire and rescue had to do extensive work in connection with the removal and opening of the vehicle enough to get it out, he was trapped for some time, he told the journalists.
When I went there for the last time and he was being removed he-LSB-the driver-RSB-was awake and aware of what was going on around him.
Edwards began his career in Formula Ford 10 years ago before competing in the Formula Renault UK and the British GT.
He won the FIA GT3 Championship in 2006 before moving on to the Porsche Supercup competition in 2008.
Amazing.
David Coulthard, the former Formula 1 driver, went to Twitter to express his condolences.
He wrote: Shocking news about the passing of Sean Edwards, the best man and super talented runner, condolences to his closest and dearest.

"Commemoration Day is a United States holiday to remind men and women who have died while serving in the armed forces. The armed forces include all branches of the U.S. military. Those branches are Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force and Coast Guard. Commemorative Day is a federal holiday, meaning government offices, banks, post offices and schools are closed. Commemoration Day is always celebrated on the last Monday in May. Commemoration Day has its roots in the U.S. Civil War when a holiday, Decoration Day, was established to honor both the Union and Confederate soldiers who died. On Decor Day people used to ""decorate"" the graves of dead soldiers with flags and flowers. The name Memorial Day was more widely used after World War II in late 1940. However, the party was not officially called Memory Day until 1967.

Commemoration Day is commemorated by ceremonies in cemeteries throughout the country. The best known is located at Arlington National Cemetery, near Washington D.C. Arlington is a military cemetery, which means that only military personnel are buried there. Volunteers place U.S. flags in military tombs in Arlington and other national cemeteries. There are also parades in honour of the fallen service people held in different cities and towns. Another tradition of Commemorative Day is to fly the flag of the United States at half a person until noon, which means that it flies at half its normal height. This is considered a sign of mourning. The flag rises to its full height after noon as a sign that the military will rise despite the loss. There is also a National Memorial Day concert that takes place on the lawn of the American capital.
Commemoration Day is also known as the unofficial start of the summer season. Many beaches and pools open for Memorial Day weekend. Many people also organize barbecues on the Memorial Day weekend.",B2
"There may not be any other director in the American film industry that is more controversial than Michael Moore. Moore's specialty is exposure. He loves to expose social problems. He is a political activist and a social critic. His films have a way of provoking strong emotional responses.

Moore was born in Flint, Michigan in 1954. His father was an assembly line worker at General Motors, a car manufacturing plant; his mother was a secretary. He attended the campus of the University of Michigan, Flint, where he left after his first year. He found work as a journalist with a couple of different local publications, but was fired from one of his jobs due to controversy. Moore wanted to publish a story about U.S. participation in Nicaragua, but its editors refused, leading to his dismissal. He was awarded $58,000 in an out-of-court settlement after he sued his employers.
Moore used the money to start making documentaries. The first was ""Roger & Me"", which was a piece designed to expose the closure of the Flint plant by GM and its decision to open a plant in Mexico, where wages were much lower. His film exposes greed corporations like GM by cutting the lifeline of many American workers so that GM can make more profits. GM had reported record profits before closing, which irritated Moore a lot.
He followed this film with a series of documentaries that touched on many of the social and political problems that Americans face every day. His film ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", investigates the aftermath of the 11/11 terrorist attacks in the United States in 2001. He is not kind to the George W. Bush administration for his lack of response to the attacks, and with the Bush family's alleged ties to Osama Bin Laden, the mastermind of the attack.",B2
"Golf is one of the most popular games in the United States today. There have been many great champions over the years like Arnold Palmer, and Jack Nicklaus, but none have seen success as Tiger Woods. His father was black; his mother was Thai. He was born and lived his first life in Thailand.

Woods joined the professional golf tour at the age of 20 in 1996, where he began setting records to win championships at an early age. She was one of the most promising young stars to reach the tour in years, which led Woods to acquire several lucrative contracts with Nike, and Titleist. Woods became a very young millionaire. In 2001, Woods became the first player in history to hold the title in the four main golf tournaments. It seemed that there was nothing this young man could not accomplish.
Woods grew up in Orange County, California, and studied for two years at the prestigious Stanford University. Woods started playing golf at an early age, and before long he was winning amateur championships regularly. It was the Newbie of the Year of the Professional Association of Golfers (PGA) in 1996. He has been named PGA Player of the Year, and PGA Tour Player of the Year, 11 times each. He has also directed the tour as the biggest money winner for several years. He was married and had two children. Her life is supposed to be ideal, but that changed in 2009.
Woods was exposed as a womanizer by several women, after an alleged affair with a woman from New York. Woods denied any evil, but finally confessed several ""indiscretions"". The controversy continued to gain momentum, eventually leading to their divorce and the loss of money from sponsors' back-up. Woods is back on the tour, but he hasn't recovered his competition like before.",B2
"Russian space officials say the Soyuz spacecraft crew is resting after a hard trip back to Earth.
A South Korean bioengineer was one of three people aboard Soyuz's capsule.
The ship carrying South Korea's first astronaut landed in northern Kazakhstan on Saturday, 260 miles - LRB- 418 kilometers -RRB- outside its mark, they said.
Mission Control spokesman Valery Lyndin said the condition of the crew -- South Korean bioengineer Yi So-yeon, U.S. astronaut Peggy Whitson and Russian flight engineer Yuri Malenchenko -- was satisfactory, although all three had been subjected to severe G forces during the re-entry.
The search helicopters took 25 minutes to find the capsule and determine that the crew was unharmed.
The officers said that the ship followed a very steep trajectory that subjected the crew to gravitational forces up to 10 times that of Earth.
Interfax reported that the ship's landing was hard.
This is not the first time a spacecraft has deviated from its planned trajectory during landing.
In October, Soyuz's capsule landed 70 kilometres from the planned area due to a damaged control cable. The capsule had two Russian cosmonauts and the first Malaysian astronaut. E-mail to a friend

"Thailand's rice bowl is now Thailand's nightmare.
The Chao Phraya River Delta nourishes the nation's vast rice fields. But on Friday, the river and its many tributaries looked at the capital, Bangkok, like a ferocious animal stalking its prey.
Monsoon rains have flooded the plains of Thailand and now the river that explodes threatens to drown Bangkok.
The water has already turned the parking lots into marinas, markets in lakes and houses into fish-only houses. It has sunk into the houses of the saints -- Buddhist temples were in the midst of rising water -- and in sanctuaries of the vulnerable.
Fifteen elephants, including seven mothers with babies and a 9-year-old child known for their painting skills, are stranded at the top of Ayutthaya's Royal Elephant Kraal. Elephants climbed to the top of the building last week and are starving now that food can only be brought in small quantities in rowing boats. Elephants can swim, but babies could drown in an attempt to escape.
In Bangkok and other bewildered towns and villages, the forts carried the weak on their backs. The young people helped the old ones.
Everyone helped each other.
It was hard to imagine that last year, the Red Shirts fought the Yellow Shirts in deadly political street protests that caused a state of emergency in Thailand and left a nation deeply divided.
The disaster brought them together again this week.
A Facebook page in English created to help foreigners in Thailand saw a frenzy of action on Friday.

Both lanes of Bangkruy-Sainoi Rd... flooded
With 283 dead and 8 million others affected by the floods, fears were real in Bangkok.
The workers filled the sandbags furiously and backed up the barriers. Evacuation centres began to be filled with people.
Banjong Palim, 43, said he had never seen anything like it in his life. He was forced to flee when his suburban home in Bangkok drowned.
Some recalled the devastating 2004 tsunami that destroyed everything with water walls. And he panicked.
Ed White observed the flow of the river over the retaining walls in Ayutthaya. He stacked the furniture as high as he could in his house, and he felt fortunate that it was made of concrete and brick, not wood, like so many traditional Thai houses.
White grew up in Ocean City, Maryland. I was used to hurricanes and the fury of the Atlantic. But this was different.
The water wasn't furious. There were no torrents.
He just kept inlaying himself up. Slowly, but surely.
In the market where White cuts her hair, people run, spreading rumors born of fear. In two hours, they said, everything would be underwater. The flood was coming! The flood was coming!
White moved to Thailand in 2003 to work for a rubber company. On Friday, he said he had moved to a second-floor company apartment in Bangkok, sure he would be safe there. Meanwhile, his employer had made a fortress of the rubber factory, erecting concrete barriers around everything as if it were a war zone.
For many it was a lost battle.
The military helped evacuate them, rubbing them by boat or carrying them through the chest water.
Almost every day now, the rain has come down hard, exacerbating concerns. This is already the worst flood Thailand has seen in decades. Some wondered on Friday how much worse it could get.
The head of the Government Flood Support Center said Bangkok would be saved. But with the possibility of storms in the forecast for the next few days, Friday's assurances were hard to swallow.

"United Nations, an international organization founded in 1945 after World War II by 51 countries, is based along the East River in New York. Technically, anyone visiting United Nations Headquarters is no longer in New York. They're not even in the United States. This is because land and buildings are considered international territory. The United Nations has its own flag, its own post office and its own postage stamps. However, there is no need to change currency. The UN uses the US dollar. Six official languages are used in the United Nations. They are Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish. The UN rules prevail over the laws of New York City. This does not mean that people can commit crimes there and get away with it. There is no immunity for those who commit crimes there.

The assets in which the United Nations is currently located used to belong to a slaughterhouse. The current buildings were completed in 1952. The UN perimeter is covered with a flagpole with the flags of the 193 UN Member States and the UN flag. They are organized in alphabetical order in English.
Some may think it's great to be a neighbor to a peacekeeping agency like the UN. Many New Yorkers don't always think that way. Every time a dignitary like a president or prime minister visits, the streets are closed, making it difficult to move and find parking.
However, you don't need to be a diplomat to visit the UN. There are tours from Monday to Friday and not just in English. Guided tours are available in English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and Swedish. Visitors can eat in the Delegates' dining room with a food buffet from all over the world.",B2
"Anti-China protesters gathered Saturday in Tokyo and six other major cities in Japan to protest against what they call an invasion of disputed islands that both claim to be part of their territories.
Protesters raised Japanese flags and sang: We will not allow communist China to invade our territory.
Beijing says that the Diaoyu Islands and most of the South China Sea belong to China, contesting neighboring countries it claims. In Japan, the islands are known as Senkaku.
The demonstration was organized by Toshio Tamagomi, a former Japanese chief of staff for the Self-Defense Force.
Japan rejects China’s demand for an apology
The Senkaku Islands are the traditional territory of Japan, Tamogami said. If we do not protect it, China will take steps to take it.
Tamogami called China a thief and promised to protect the islands.
Beijing and Tokyo have been colliding over the arrest of a Chinese fishing captain by Japan outside the disputed islands.
The captain was accused of beating two Japanese coastguard ships and obstructing public officials while they were in office.
“I am very angry with China,” Shohei Fukumoto said.
China should apologize and pay for the ship's repair because the captain was on Japan's territory at the time of the accident, according to Fukumoto.
Japan has since released the fishing captain, who returned to the welcome of a hero in China.
Yoko Sakamoto, 55, said Japan has been too easy for China.
I would like to criticize the Japanese government’s weak attitude towards the question of China and the Senkaku Islands, rather than China itself, Sakamoto said. We should regain our national pride.
The captain's arrest caused the suspension of diplomatic talks and cancelled travel between nations.
Beijing has apologized and paid compensation for the arrest, which Tokyo has rejected.
Japan has also sought compensation for damage to coastguard vessels.

"Since 2008, Barack Obama has been President of the United States of America. He is a historical figure mainly because he is the first African-American to hold the post of president. His policies have won him many supporters, as well as many detractors. He is possibly one of the most divisive presidents to rule the country in the history of the United States. Obama is a Democratic Party representative with his presidency coming after controversial George W. Bush left office.

One of the defining aspects of his presidency is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly and inexactly called Obamacare. This law, passed by the United States Congress and signed by the President in March 2010, entered into force on January 1, 2014. It is the single and most significant change in government health care since Medicare was implemented in 1965. This law was intended to increase the affordability of care for Americans, expand insurance coverage and reduce the rate of uninsured insurance in the country. It is a controversial act that has many detractors, but most Americans now have health insurance, which was not true before 2014.
Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1961. He graduated from Columbia University in New York City and Harvard Law School. Before becoming president, he served as a senator for the state of Illinois. He is considered a liberal by many conservatives in the south, but this may be an unfair label. The perception is largely due to the Affordable Care Act and its attempts at immigration reform. In addition, Obama put an end to the U.S. involvement in the Iraq war. He also ordered the military operation that eventually resulted in the death of Osama Bin Laden. Obama was re-elected president in November 2012.",B2
"It has been called ""Mother and Dad's Hotel"", but few guest houses have such favorable conditions. As the housing crisis bites, one fifth of young adults stay in the family home until they are at least 26 years old and the same proportion do not pay a penny for their livelihood. A recent survey revealed that the proportion of adults living at home varied across the country, from just under 9% in the Eastern Midlands to more than twice as much as in London, where housing prices and rents are higher. While many across the country contributed financially, the survey found that 20% paid nothing at all.
Young adults are being squeezed by low wages and rents, which have reached record highs, while those who want to buy a property are finding the monthly cost of rent prevents them from saving enough to climb the stairs of the house. The research published by the homeless organization Shelter showed that half the tenants could not save a penny for a deposit, while a quarter could only put it at 100 pounds or less each month. Mortgages are cheaper than ever thanks to low record interest rates, but the best offers are still reserved for borrowers with large deposits.
Faced with this, young adults are increasingly returning to the family home to save money and parents who cannot afford to offer their children a lump sum seem willing to help. The survey found that 28% of adults lived at home because they were trying to save for a deposit. However, he also found that 30% did not save money.
A spokesman for the company that conducted the survey commented: “Mother and dad’s hotel often remains open for longer than many expected, shows our latest research. Rental costs and deposits or the need to save for a mortgage deposit means that some children have to wait understandably before flying the nest. And for some, moving can never be an option.”
Michael Day, 30, who lives with his parents in Bristol, says he has been caught between paying high rents and saving for a mortgage deposit. Renting a one-bedroom home in the city costs between £500 and £800 a month, while buying a similar property would cost around £130,000. “I really don’t want to move to rent because it’s more than a mortgage, but you need such a big deposit to get a mortgage, so it’s been a bit of a vicious circle.”
Day doesn't want to share with strangers so their options are limited. At home, he pays a nominal rent to cover bills and is able to keep the rest of his earnings from his work at a candle retailer. Play golf at county level and admit that instead of saving, you spend your spare money on golf and vacation. “You need so much money that I’ll have to save for the foreseeable future,” he said. “Because it’s been so hard, I’ve been on vacation and enjoying it.”
Sue Green, from Saga, a business that sells insurance and products to those over 50, said most parents may not have planned for their children to live with them until they were 20 or 30. “Most will be more than happy to stay in the family home without paying rent because it could help their children get on the property ladder before,” he said. “Children who do not pay rent can contribute in other ways, such as buying groceries, doing family chores, or doing occasional work at home.”
Angus Hanton, co-founder of a thinktank called the Intergenerational Foundation, said older generations were “the architects of the housing crisis” and that children should not be blamed for staying home. “Children under 30 years of age have suffered a fall in average income of about 20% since the 2008 recession. Rents and car insurance have never been so high and the rules of mortgage loans have become tougher for young people, but not for the larger rental buying investors, who squeeze young people,” he said. “Students’ debt is rising rapidly, however, many of the jobs offered (zero-hour contracts and short-term contracts) are turning younger workers into second-class citizens. Instead of blaming young people, we should defend their interests so that they can afford to build their own lives.”
Jenna Gavin, 29, lives in Southport, Merseyside, in the family home where she grew up. She moved for a year to go to college, but has been living with her parents ever since. He works as a medical receptionist nearby, so he wants to stay in the area. But renting a one-bedroom apartment would cost more than £420 a month before bills, which would take a lot of your profits. “I don’t want to rent – I don’t want to spend all that money and I don’t have anything at the end,” he said. “I’ve looked at the purchase and seen mortgage advisors, but I can’t borrow enough to get on the property ladder.”
Gavin is trying to save but is struggling to accumulate the necessary funds. “You don’t really see it accumulate as much as you need – even a 5% deposit is so much money and I’d like to put more,” he said. Her parents are happy not to charge her rent. “They want me to try to save and I contribute in other ways – I bring food and do things around the house.”
Gavin gets along with his parents and has his own space in a room where he moved when he was 14, but said he had always imagined he would have his own place by the time he was 30. “I don’t see that happening since it’s next year. But hopefully, in a couple of years, I will have moved.”

"When parents send their children to school, they often do not know what happens day by day. Parents trust what their children tell them about how they are doing and what they are learning. Usually, schools will host parent-teacher lectures at least twice a year. Lectures between parents and teachers are short meetings between parents and teachers of their children. Usually, parent-teacher conferences are held when teachers give a student's qualifications for the term. Parent-teacher conferences provide teachers with the opportunity to inform parents about how their children are doing. A teacher will communicate to a parent the strengths of the student and let him or her know about any problems with grades or behavior. The meetings also offer parents the opportunity to ask questions and see what their child is learning.

When it is almost time for parent-teacher conferences, the school will send parents a note and usually give them an appointment time. There are appointments during the day and at night. Evening appointments are used for parents who work during the day. Conferences between parents and teachers do not last long. They usually don't last more than 10 minutes. That's why it's important for parents to make sure they get to their appointments on time and come prepared with questions. If a parent needs more than 10 minutes, he or she should try to schedule another meeting with the teacher. Keeping a teacher for more than 10 minutes when parents are waiting is disrespectful.
Most children do not go to meetings with their parents. This allows both the parent and the teacher to speak honestly about the child’s progress without making him feel bad. Usually, a teacher will offer advice to the father on how to support his child's education.",B2
"including a private gym. The seven-story superyacht also comes with two swimming pools, numerous Jacuzzis, and a hairdresser and hairdresser.
However, in a global climate of rich and poor, is it morally justifiable to spend $1 billion on a private yacht for 36 guests?
To be honest, what ordinary mortals think is moral is not really relevant to these people, Kampfner said.
You have to understand that we are not talking about the top 1% -- in this case we are talking about 0.01%. This is a small group that lives in their own bubble, they mix only with each other.
Timm sees things differently, pointing out the employment opportunities created during the construction and operation of the superyacht.
The ship will take approximately two to three million human hours to build, not counting all the world-wide outsourcing hours, or items already available on the market ready to be installed on the yacht, he said.
The construction of the yacht in the shipyard will directly employ at least 500 people over a period of three years. These people, who have families to support and feed, will have paid employment.
And this does not include the 50 to 70 people who will work on the yacht and will be employed full-time by the yacht owner, as well as others who supply the yacht.
Extend this reasoning to the media -- you, the journalist, benefit from this building indirectly by being used profitably by CNN to write this story.
And you, the person who reads this story? Kampfer sees the public interest in the lifestyles of the super rich as a kind of luxury porn.
There is a huge sense of injustice that is shared not only by the poor, but also by the middle class, towards the super-rich globals, he said.
But along with that, however, it is a sense of envy and smelling. So whether they call it confusion, or double standards, or hypocrisy, or whatever, we both hate the lifestyles of the super rich and at the same time are infinitely fascinated by them.

"John Lennon is one of the most complex individuals in history to walk the face of the earth. The British musician is a true international icon that influenced the world with his message of peace and love. In the United States, Lennon is one of the most beloved people who has ever called the United States home.

Lennon was one of the founding members of the international supergroup, the Beatles. He, along with Paul McCartney, formed the early creative trust of the brain of a band that changed music around the world. The group's success has never doubled, and its music is as popular today as in the 1960s and 1970s.
Lennon wrote, or co-wrote, some of the most memorable melodies ever written in the Rock ‘n’ Roll genre. He found great success as a member of the Beatles, which is the most commercially successful group in history, and as a solo artist. Lennon was also a political activist. His views on religion and politics caused much controversy in the United States. He was a frank critic of the country's involvement in the Vietnam conflict. His popularity caused great concern among government officials because he had the attention of young people in the United States at the time.
Lennon had been living in New York for several years, where he was being watched by the FBI in order to find reasons to deport him from the United States. He used extravagant tricks to spread his word of peace. In this passive protest, Lennon and his wife Ono went to the media from their beds saying that people should “make love, not war.” Lennon was murdered on December 8, 1980 by a crazy gunman outside his home in New York City. A commemorative plaque at the site of his death is one of the most visited sites in the country.",B2

"Supporting a Congressional campaign usually means donating money, knocking on doors, and making phone calls. Rarely does it mean acting like a nudist in a television ad that will be played throughout your community.
I mean, until Kelly Kultala's campaign for Congress asked her supporters exactly that.
Kultala, a Democrat who ran to expel the Republican from Kansas, Kevin Yoder, posted an announcement Thursday that included a handful of seemingly naked people urging viewers to support the Democrat in the November elections.
People in the ad, however, are not real nudists. They are supporters of the Kultala campaign who agreed to appear on television with different objects in front of their naked parts.
They are volunteers who agreed to do so because they support our campaign and our message, said Jacob Becklund, Kultala's campaign manager. It should also be noted that no one was really naked during the shooting.
According to Becklund, it was a fairly easy sale to all our volunteers, despite the fact that the ad - which comes with a high figure - LRB- cost -RRB- behind it - will be viewed on cable and broadcast on the Kansas City market as of Friday.
The nudity - LRB-faux-RRB- in the announcement, titled Naked Truth, was a blow to Yoder, who in 2011 plunged thinly into the Sea of Galilee in Israel, a decision by which he was reprimanded by the Republicans of the House in 2012.
A while ago, Congressman Yoder made news by swimming naked at work, Kultala says in the announcement. But it's more shameless what he's doing to Kansas.
The announcement then presents apparently naked volunteers citing different aspects of Yoder's record, including that Yoder fills the pockets of his millionaire donors with large tax cuts. And they line up with yours, when you have pockets.
“We thought it was a humorous hook,” Becklund said, getting people to pay attention to the message.

"One of the most divisive eras in American history is Vietnam. The Vietnam era for the United States lasted approximately from 1960 to 1975. In the mid-1960s, U.S. involvement became a big problem. The conflict in Vietnam was divisive for many reasons, but mainly because of the public's perception that it was an immoral and illegal operation. The other important factor was that the United States was still engaged in recruiting young men to serve the country against its will.

One of the major Hollywood stars of the time was Jane Fonda. Fonda came from Hollywood royalty, being the daughter of the great actor, Henry Fonda. He won two Oscars, seven Golden Globe awards and an Emmy award throughout his long career. In the 1960s she was a political activist who was against the war in Vietnam. She was very frank against the conflict, as were many celebrities at the time.
In 1970, Fonda made headlines for a very different reason. She and two fellow actors starred in a film against the war that attracted much controversy. In July 1972, Fonda attracted the anger of many Americans when she was photographed sitting with members of the North Vietnamese Army with an anti-aircraft weapon. That image soiled her reputation as an actress, and as a true American. Many called Fonda a traitor for interacting with the enemy. Years later, Fonda said she was manipulated to take that picture, but many Americans still have their doubts.
During his trip to North Vietnam, he was at war with the US. Supported by South Vietnam, Fonda made a series of radio broadcasts denouncing America's involvement in the war. This further consolidated his image as a traitor. However, there are many Americans who feel that she was a true patriot because she refused to stand still and spoke against the war.",B2
"Malian authorities have found a mass grave with 21 bodies believed to be dead soldiers while a junta leader was in power after a 2012 military coup, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said on Wednesday.
Investigators found the bodies in a tomb near a military camp in the village of Diago, just north of Bamako, spokesman Alasane Diarra said.
Last week, General Amadou Sanogo, who led the March 2012 coup, was arrested on charges of complicity in the kidnapping.
A failed backlash soon after taking power faced two factions of the army: the green berets loyal to Sanogo and the red berets loyal to the overthrown President Amadou Toumani Toure.
At the military camp in Diago, there were green berets and red soldiers berets. “We do not know which group the soldiers belonged to in the tomb,” Diarra said.
Investigations into alleged kidnappings and killings following the military takeover that plunged West African country into chaos have been ongoing since 30 April 2012.
Investigators have been working on the case since April, so right after the coup. “They have known about the tomb for a while, but when they finally went there and opened the tomb, there were more bodies than they thought before,” Diarra said.
The bodies are all male and of different ethnic groups, he said.
As the bodies are removed from the grave, forensic investigators will begin the process of identifying the men.
The families of the soldiers who disappeared during the coup will be asked to come and identify their relatives, Diarra said.

"1 Clouds passing through
One of the pleasures of flying is to see the clouds closely. Although they seem insubstantial they carry a considerable weight of water – about 500 tons in a small cloud of cumulus. And the water is denser than the air. Then why don't clouds fall out of the sky like rain? They do. But the droplets take a long time to sink. A half-cloud would take a year to fall one meter.
2 In the cloud nine
Most of us are happy to label clouds “spongy” or “nauseabunda black ones, ” but meteorologists identify more than 50 types of clouds depending on shape and altitude. These fit into categories given numbers from one to nine. Cloud nine is the huge, imposing cumulonimbus, so being “in cloud nine” means being on top of the world.
3 Around the Rainbow
There's no better place to see a rainbow than from a plane. Rainbows occur when sunlight reaches raindrops. We see a bow because the Earth stands in the way, but, from a plane, a rainbow is a complete circle. Passing over the clouds, the shadow of the plane appears clearly at the center of the effect.
4 Mr. Blue Sky
The sunlight is white, it contains all the colors of the spectrum but, as it passes through the air, some of the light disperses when it interacts with the gas molecules. The blue light scatters more than the colors of less energy, so the blue seems to come from the sky.
5 There's life out there
Apart from clouds and other planes, we do not expect to see much directly outside the window of a flying plane, but the air is leaking with bacterial life – up to 1,800 different types of bacteria have been detected in cities and can reach twice the cruise height of an airplane.
6 Terror of turbulence
Even the most experienced steering wheel can be turned green by turbulence. The result can be anything, from repeated blows to sudden and dramatic dives. The good news for nervous flyers is that no modern aircraft has been shot down by turbulence. People have been injured and sometimes killed when they are not tied up, or beaten by poorly insured baggage – but the plane will not be hit out of the sky.
7 Radiation in flight
When body scanners were introduced at airports there were fears of radiation, but the level produced is the same as the passengers receive in a minute of flight. The Earth is constantly bombarded by cosmic rays, natural radiation from space that has more impact at altitude.
8 Jet lag cannot be cured
The world is divided into time zones. The result is that the long journey results in a difference between the local time and the time of your body, causing jet lag. However, its effects can be minimized by keeping food soft for 24 hours before traveling, drinking lots of fluids and living in your destination time from the moment you arrive on the plane.
9 Supersonic 747s
Many of us have traveled faster than sound. There are a number of jets in the upper atmosphere, especially on the U.S. journey. to Europe, where a temperature reversal causes an air corridor to move as fast as 250 mph. If a passenger plane with a speed of 550 mph enters a stream jet, the result can be to fly at 800 mph, above 740 mph of sound.
10 Fly Through Time
Time zones provide an artificial journey through time, but special relativity means that a flight involves a journey in real time. It is so minimal, however, that crossing the Atlantic weekly for 40 years would only move you 1/1,000 of a second in the future.
11 Terrible Tea
Don't blame the cabin manager if your tea isn't great. The water should be below 100°C when poured over the tea leaves, but that is not possible on an airplane. It is impossible to get water beyond 90°C during the flight, so choose the coffee.
12 I cannot hear my food
The airline's food has a reputation for being bland and insipid. However, some of the problems may not be poor catering services. An airplane is a noisy environment and there is evidence that food loses part of its flavor when we are exposed to loud noises.
13 Needle in a haystack
With modern technology, it seems strange that Malaysia's MH370 flight can disappear without a trace, but finding a missing plane is a needle problem in a Haystack. The aircraft knows its location, both from GPS and inertial tracking, but this information is not transmitted elsewhere in real time. That would be perfectly possible. Ships sailing through the oceans have been monitored since the 1980s; the limitation is not technology, but the lack of legislation that requires it.
14 Volcanic sequelae
Air travel can be cancelled by volcanic activity. The glass-like ash particles melt into the heat of the engine, then solidify into the rotors. A clear sky policy in a cloud of ashes may be inconvenient, but the risks of ignoring ash are clear.
15 The myth of the wing
For many years, we taught the wrong explanation of how the wings keep the planes in the air. In fact, most of the lift on a plane comes from Newton's Third Law of Movement. The wing has the way to push the air down. As the air is pushed down, the wing gets an equal and opposite push up, lifting the plane.
16 Forget electric aircraft
When we see ultralight, experimental and electric aircraft, it is easy to assume that there will soon be clean, green and electric aircraft, but it will not happen at any time. The fuel packages of the aircraft in a remarkable amount of energy. Batteries are much less efficient. To provide the same energy as a ton of fuel would require 100 tons of batteries, and a 747 uses 150 to 200 tons of fuel. Unless battery technology is much more efficient, electric aircraft will not take off from the ground.
17 Watch out for the vortex
Pilots often wait a long time to get clearance. This is to allow the air to settle after a previous takeoff, as the wing tips of an airplane generate vortexes in the air, which can take two or three minutes to disperse. If the next aircraft takes off immediately, the rapidly moving air would make the aircraft difficult to handle. The delay gives air time to recover from miniature whirlwinds caused by the anterior plane.
18 Doors are not closed
In practice, the doors of an airplane do not need to be closed. If you see an open plane door, it swings in an unusual way. First it has to be opened inwards before maneuvering it out of the way. Once the plane has taken off, a significant pressure difference soon accumulates between the inside of the plane and the outside. This differential forces the door in place. To open it, you'd have to throw it against air pressure, far beyond the capabilities of human muscles.

"Transformers actress Megan Fox said yes to Brian Austin Green's marriage proposal, only four months after suspending a two-year engagement with Green, her publicist confirmed.
Fox, 24, was so excited when Green, 36, asked the question on a beach in Hawaii that dropped the 2-carat diamond engagement ring in the sand, Us Weekly reported.
Despite a long search by the hotel staff, the ring was never found, the magazine reported.
Fox and Green started dating six years ago and first engaged in 2007. They broke it last February.
Marriage can be easier for Fox now that he's out of the Transformers franchise. Director Michael Bay announced this month that she is being replaced as Shia LaBeouf's loving interest by model-actress Rosie Huntington-Whiteley for Transformers 3.
Fox played Mikaela Banes in the early Transformers and their sequel Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.
Green spent a decade playing David Silver in the successful television series Beverly Hills, 90210 until it was canceled in 2000.

"Labor Day is celebrated on the first Monday in September. It is a holiday intended to honor the contributions, both economic and social, of American workers. It has been an official federal holiday since 1894, meaning that government offices, including post offices and schools, are closed.

It is also widely believed that Labor Day was created as an alternative holiday to May Day. May Day, especially in the 1800s, had become a day of protest, when workers marched to demand better rights and working conditions. Often there were strikes that ended in violence. At that time, the U.S. government feared that May Day was led by communists and was having a bad influence on the workers. Some people feel that September was also chosen as there are no other holidays between July 4th and Thanksgiving in November.
Labor Day is often paraded in major cities across the country. Politicians and trade union leaders deliver speeches and hold press conferences. Labor Day is also considered the unofficial end of summer. Many people celebrate Labor Day with trips to the beaches, picnics and barbecues. Many towns and cities host fireworks on this day. Many people also take their last summer vacation around this time. Labor Day is also the beginning of the professional and university football season in the United States.
Labor Day has also become an important retail holiday. Many stores have Labor Day sales to coincide with the start of the school year for many children in the United States. This means that many shop workers, while celebrating their holidays, have to work long hours.",B2
"It is well known that the fashion industry is one of the most difficult to enter. To conform to the traditional stereotype of a model it is necessary to be skinny, impressive and have legs that go forever, right?
He's trying to tell Refilwe Modiselle that... he's breaking all the rules while mocking the catwalk as Africa's first albino model.
I was being tenacious and saying no, wait a minute. This is a different representation of what African beauty is, Modiselle tells CNN.
They tell you a black boy must be brown-skinned, but what do you call a girl like me? I'm not tall either. But there he was modeling with the tastes of his Adiambo, his famous models that have done very well.
In 1999, Modiselle was only 13 years old when he first approached her to shoot a five-page film for a youth magazine to show how the African fashion landscape would change with the turn of the millennium. It was her first taste of fashion, but she got the microphone.
However, it would not be until he finished his secondary education and entered the university - LRB- at the behest of his mother -RRB - that Modiselle met in front of a camera again.
Redefining Beauty
The movement started her career and soon the South African student looked at herself from the pages of bright magazines and slid through tracks at high-profile events such as Mercedes Benz Africa Fashion Week.
I was challenging everything that society says defines a model. Basically I'm saying that it's okay, we're going to teach our children a different definition of beauty, or a definition that's always been there, but that's always been ignored.
Albinism is an inherited condition caused by lack of melanin, a pigment on the skin, hair, and eyes. Although it is quite common throughout the world -- one in every 17,000 people are born with some form of genetic disorder -- albinos throughout Africa are often discriminated against and even, in some countries, persecuted and killed because of their appearance.
People with albinism are often not given the opportunity to enter such industries because we are not known as extroverts, we are not given the opportunity to be identified in society as people who have the potential to represent something, he says.
Identity crisis
But Modiselle not only has to live with the tactical threat of discrimination hanging in the air. Born in Soweto, the young, fighting model has sometimes struggled with her identity.
The 28-year-old explains: South Africa has a history of apartheid, where race is such a big segregation. How do you get on then? You're a girl born in a black society: the municipality. And now you have to fit into a world where, they tell you, this is black, this is white, and you're in a country that's constantly fighting these aspects. It's something that's not easy because people are trying to locate you and identify you in a specific way.
Cementing his status as a family name, he also spends one day a week filming a topical interview program with other South African TV personalities Masechaba Lekalake and comedian Tol Ass Mo..
Participation in the show allows Modeselle to reveal more of her personality to the country, and show that she is more than just a clothes horse. Even though he's not even 30, Modiselle is already thinking about his legacy.
I'll teach through the things I do. -LRB- Mi -RRB- plan for the future is only to grow as a brand and as an entity: touch the world in different places and be able to be a great representative for Africa.

"On the London subway train five years ago, the thirty-something marketing manager never imagined that his morning trip could lead to the Paralympic Games. Now, that's exactly where Martine Wright from Britain is putting his sights.
Wright lost both legs when a suicide bomber flew on an underground train near Aldgate station in London on the morning of 7 July 2005. He also suffered a skull fracture and severe arm injuries.
Although it was one of the most seriously injured that day, Wright is now targeting a spot on the British paralympic volleyball team in 2012.
I would absolutely love to be part of the Paralympics in 2012, Wright told CNN affiliate ITN last month. I mean, if you'd told me that five years ago, I would have thought you were completely crazy. But going back to London, where I was born, and doing something so positive -- after leaving something so negative -- would be absolutely incredible.
That day, in July, four bombs were dropped on three underground trains and a bus. Fifty-six people were killed, including the four bombers, and more than 770 were injured.
The bombings occurred the day after the International Olympic Committee announced that London would host the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.
Wright said he made a promise to himself and his family after the attacks to seize every opportunity he could.
I think I've done more than I did before, he told ITN. I've learned how to fly planes, and I've jumped off a plane, I've learned how to ski again.
He competed for... and won... a spot on the British volleyball team. The British Volleyball Federation announced its place on the team last month, and this week the team is competing at the 2010 Sitting Volleyball World Championship in the U.S. state of Oklahoma.
Some 640 athletes from 20 countries are participating in the event, the largest international competition before London 2012, according to Lisa Wainwright, executive director of Volleyball England, the national governing body of sport.
John Bestebroer, the lead coach of the women's team, calls the championships a great training opportunity for 2012.
Sitting volleyball is a version of the sport that allows anyone to participate, including those with a disability. The men's event has been part of the Paralympics since 1980 and the women's since 2004, according to British Volleyball.
International volleyball rules apply in the sitting version, with certain amendments for disabled players: During the game, a player should play the court with some part of the body between the buttocks and shoulders, and players are allowed to block services. In addition, sitting volleyball is played on a smaller court with a lower net.
Wright told Evening Standard in London that the 2012 Games will have an added poignancy because his last real memory before the bombings was celebrating with his colleagues when London was chosen to host the Olympic Games.
She was the last person to leave the station that day, and Wright said she feels like she's one of the lucky ones.
Even in your darkest days, there will always be someone worse than you, unfortunately Wright told ITN. There were 52 people that day who were definitely worse than me, because I'm still here.

"A four-year-old Ohio girl who disappeared more than three weeks ago was found alive and in good condition, halfway across the country in southern California, authorities said.
Haylee Donathan was found with her mother and her mother's boyfriend, fugitive sex offender Robbie Potter.
Haylee Donathan, her mother Candace Watson and Robbie Potter were discovered hiding last week at The Morning Star Ranch, a retreat at Valley Center near San Diego, said Peter Elliott, United States Marshal for the Northern District of Ohio.
Officials said Potter is a registered sex offender. He was being sought out by the U.S. Marshal's service.
Last Tuesday Haylee was in the custody of a child protection services agency in the San Diego County area, Elliott said. He was doing well, but he may have chickenpox, he added.
We understand that she is healthy and happy and I think, waiting to get back to her grandmother here, she said. Observation authorities announce their finding
The west trip took them more than 2,000 miles from Mansfield, Ohio's north-central city where the girl and her mother live.
“I am very happy that my granddaughter returns home,” said Mary Watson, Haylee’s grandmother. And I want to thank you all from the bottom of my heart.
Watson, 24, and Potter, 27, were arrested without incident and detained by the San Diego County Sheriff's Department. When asked their reaction, Elliott said, I think a little surprised that we were able to find them.
Potter and Watson were still using the same vehicle, a blue Chevrolet truck from the 1980s driving from Ohio, Elliott said.
Watson's hair was a little darker and Potter also slightly changed his appearance.
Authorities were afraid Haylee would be in danger. Potter, a sex offender, had escaped from a house midway on May 28, the day the girl and her mother fell out of sight.
Countless advice came while they were missing, but one in particular led to progress on Tuesday, Elliott said unprepared.
But a tip from ranch members could have led to the raid and the arrest, a rancher told CNN.
Kevin Carlin, a rancher in the Valley Center neighborhood, told CNN in a phone interview that ranch members suspected when a former ranch guest saw billboards urging them to help find Haylee and the two adults.
Elliott also praised the intense national news coverage of programs such as Nancy Grace and HLN Issues with Jane Vélez-Mitchell, as well as local media and Clear Channel, which put up billboards for missing children across the country.
When she returns to Ohio, Haylee will be placed in her grandmother's custody, Elliott said. The U.S. Marshals Northern Ohio Violent Fugitive Task Force had offered a $10,000 reward for the information that led to Potter's arrest, 27 years old.
Potter was wanted on a state order for parole violation and a federal order for parole violation. He's a level three convicted sex offender, according to the U.S. Marshals' Service, a Department of Justice unit.
While on the run, Potter and Watson were watched on surveillance video on May 31 at a Wal-Mart store in Marion, Ohio, 40 miles from Mansfield. Haylee wasn't in that video.
Adding concerns, Samantha Covert, Watson's roommate, said last week in an interview with Nancy Grace that she saw the girl in bed with her mother and Potter the morning they disappeared. Undercover said Watson was carrying a basket of clothes, pillows and blankets.
Watson will probably face state charges, including harboring a fugitive, according to Elliott.
In addition to other charges, he said Potter can be prosecuted under Adam Walsh's Child Safety and Protection Act, a federal sex offender registration and self-reporting law that carries a sentence of several years of felony if violated.
On its website, the Morning Star Ranch is described as a community of organic avocado growers, without pesticides, grapefruit, khakis, nuts and other products.
Elliot said he believed it was a rehabilitation center and also called it a Christian retreat.

"Two of Turkey's main political parties are pressing for a constitutional amendment to lift the ban on veils in public universities, a measure that has caused concern among Turkey's secular population.
The lifting of the veil ban has caused concern among the secular population of Turkey.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan initiated the movement, saying it would create equality in higher education in Turkey.
The constitutional commission will discuss the proposal -- submitted by the AKP and MHP parties -- in the coming days before it is put to the vote.
If approved, it would require the approval of President Abdullah Gul, which is expected.
According to the proposal, veils, burqas or chaddors, all of which cover the face of a woman, would not be allowed.
Turkish universities imposed bans on head caps in the early 1980s because they were seen as political symbols and were in conflict with Turkey's secular system of government.
The proposal to change Turkey's constitution caused chills among Turkey's secular population. Women's groups went to parliament on Tuesday to express their rejection.
This is a direct threat to the republic and its foundations, said Deniz Baykal, leader of Turkey's main secular party, CHP.
Another CHP legislator said she fears that if the proposal is approved, parents will feel pressure to have their daughters wear handkerchiefs on their heads, even in primary school.
Mustafa Akaydin, head of the Turkish Higher Education Commission, is against the proposal. He said allowing the veil would be a rejection of Turkey's secular system of government.
It is an attempt to create a counterrevolution, Akaydin said. It'll be a break-up point.
He said that most high school students in a school wore handkerchiefs on their heads during last weekend's entrance exams, a rarity in Turkish schools.
The Higher Education Commission will meet on Friday in Ankara to discuss the proposed changes. E-mail to a friend

"Long before the women's movement of the late 1960s and 1970s, lived a 19th century woman named Susan B. Anthony. Anthony was fighting for women's rights long before the social revolution 50 years ago. Born in 1820 in a Quaker family. Quakers are a close, faith-based group of people who live a very simple and strict life. It is a traditional way of life in which gender roles are clearly defined.

He spent much of his early life fighting for social change. She was an abolitionist, teacher, anti-slavery author, and was a leading figure in winning women the right to vote, and to take office. The voting movement was designed to obtain the right to vote of women who previously had no say in government. Another social cause Anthony was deeply involved with was the anti-slavery movement. Anthony made his family farm available for people with similar ideas to have anti-slavery meetings. She was involved in the abolitionist movement until the end of the American Civil War, when slavery was abolished. She then turned her attention to women's rights.
Anthony founded a weekly publication called ""The Revolution,"" which used to publish literature on women's rights. The newspaper's motto was ""Men are their rights, and nothing more; women are their rights, nothing less.""
In 1872, after travelling around the country trying to boost women's rights, he illegally voted in the presidential elections. She was arrested and fined, even though she fought. Anthony never paid the fine. The incident served to raise awareness of the struggle women had to endure. Anthony fought the good battle until his death in 1905 at the age of 84. Today she is honored by the mint of the United States with Susan B. Anthony's $1 coin.",B2
"Thanksgiving is a party held by many people in the United States and Canada. In the United States it is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November and marks the start of the Christmas season. Some people celebrate Thanksgiving to remember the first harvest of pilgrims and Puritans, groups of people from England who emigrated to North America in the 1600s. Some people recreate the first Thanksgiving and dress like pilgrims, Puritans, and Native Americans who are said to have helped newcomers find food to survive their first winter.

Most people, however, see Thanksgiving as one day a year to reflect on what they are grateful for. Some families will sit together and take turns saying out loud for what they are grateful for. An important part of Thanksgiving is the families that gather. Extended family members often travel long distances to share the day with their loved ones. In the United States Thanksgiving is the busiest day of the year. People travel on airplanes, trains, buses and cars to share a very special meal - Thanksgiving dinner.
What most Thanksgiving celebrations have in common is food. At Thanksgiving many families prepare large and elaborate dinners to share with friends and loved ones. Many of these dinners use ingredients associated with the autumn harvest, such as blueberries, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, and blueberries. Roast turkey is the traditional meat that is served. It's so common that some people call Thanksgiving ""Turkey Day."" Turkey is usually served with sauce and filling. Cakes are usually served for dessert. The most common cakes served are sweet potato, apple, walnut and pumpkin.
Thanksgiving is not only celebrated in the privacy of people's homes. Every year the President of the United States forgives a turkey, saving it from becoming someone's food. In New York City, Macy's, a large warehouse, holds a huge parade with huge balloons of various cartoon characters floating down the street.",B2
"Father's Day is a party celebrated in the United States to honor parents, parenthood, and other paternal figures such as grandparents, stepparents, and uncles. The third Sunday of June is observed.

In the early 20th century there was a mining accident in West Virginia that killed nearly 400 men. A push for a day to remember the murdered men, who were mostly husbands and fathers, was the beginning of a push for a national holiday. This was in 1908. It was not until 1972, however, that Father's Day was recognized by law as a national holiday. This is partly due to the fact that people were resistant to what they saw as another excessively invented holiday meant making people spend money. It did not look like a way to remember the dead or honor living parents and father figures. People weren't completely wrong. Organizations representing men's clothing manufacturers put in a lot of money for vacations to become popular.
Like Mother's Day, it is in fact a party that has become highly commercialized. There are greeting cards to mark the day, and stores announce gifts for dad. These gifts traditionally include electronics, ties and tools. In schools, children often make cards and other gifts. Father's Day is not a federal holiday although it is widely celebrated. Some of the ways Father's Day is celebrated are with meals, especially barbecues as vacations fall in early summer.",B2
"As families prepare to fly this upcoming Memorial Day weekend, United Airlines will not offer early boarding to families by bus with young children.
Joining a handful of other carriers, United made the policy change in late April with little fanfare.
Previously, families with young children were allowed to fly on a plane before the general boarding, a convenience for moms and dads trying to take their children across the friendly skies.
We thought it would be better to simplify that process and reduce the number of boarding groups, said Charles Hobart, Union spokesman. The airline allows passengers with children travelling in first class or business class to board early.
I have to ask myself if it will end up slowing things down because of the extra time it takes for families on board, Brett Snyder said from the blog manickyflier.com.
Kate Hanni from flyersrights.org calls the movement very anti-family.
There are very few things a parent can count on when it comes to flying these days, but one of those things was always the ability to approach first so that their children settle down and all their needs are met before the crowd of people get on the plane, Hanni said in an email to CNN. I hope that United will change its mind.
“If families need additional help, our door agent will work to accommodate them,” Hobart said. That message has been communicated.
“We are not going to fly United knowing that we are going to have to endure that extra trouble,” wrote Steven Manson, a Brooklyn, New York, father of four-year-old twin boys. Frankly, we always look forward to the pre-dating when we fly and try to position ourselves near the door when boarding begins. It is so useful to get the car seat connected and everyone settled before the plane is full of passengers, Manson said in an email to CNN.
A guerrilla approach to flying with children
The policy change also has roots in the merger announced in 2010 between United and Continental.
We went through a common boarding process on all planes, Hobart said.
As a policy, American Airlines also does not specifically allow families with children to board a plane before the general boarding. However, the airline said it makes an announcement to all passengers with tickets before the general boarding by asking anyone who needs extra time or assistance to show up.
It would not be realistic to predict that many families only on that one basis, wrote an American Airlines spokesperson in an email to CNN. It could easily be translated into most passengers for flight.
JetBlue offers families who travel by bus with children under 2 years of age on board early, the airline said. Delta Air Lines said it also offers passengers with children the chance to pre-board, including those with first-class tickets and business class. So does Virgin America, which said it allows children under the age of 5 to board early.
US Airways amended its pre-boarding rules for children during the past year, allowing families with children to board the plane after the call to Zone 2, but before the general announcement of boarding. Previously the airline had allowed to board before. We are always looking for ways to make the boarding process a little more efficient and faster for our passengers, spokeswoman Liz Landau said.

"Miami is well known for its tropical climate, the retired community and the Cuban-American population, but not as much as an international artistic center. Luckily for downtown Miami, billionaire real estate developer Jorge Pérez wants to change that.
The real estate promoter and art lover donated $40 million, half of his private art collection, to the Pérez Miami Art Museum, known as PAMM, one of the few important institutions in the United States with a Hispanic name.
That's definitely a way to put Miami on the map.
Ancient town found in Miami
Downtown Miami is in the middle of a major revitalization: David Beckham hopes to build a stadium there for his recently announced Miami football team. Within the art world, the international art and fashion extravagance Art Basel, which has taken place in Miami Beach for more than a decade, is considered the country's leading art fair with 130 museums and international institutions that attract tens of thousands of people to the five-day event.
Jorge Pérez hopes that his museum will help take Miami to the next level.
Cultural institutions have played a critical role in Miami's growth, with this museum as an outstanding example, Pérez said in an interview with CNN.
Before Perez became known as the Southern Florida Condo King, he began as an urban planner, focusing on low-income urbanizations.
He was then co-founder of a real estate development company, The Related Group of Florida, working on the construction of high-end condominiums in the 1980s.
In 2005, TIME magazine named him one of the 25 most influential Hispanics in the United States.
The 64-year-old billionaire also made Forbes a list of 400 richer Americans several times, the only Latino immigrant to do so.
Born in Argentina to Cuban parents, Pérez grew up in Colombia before migrating to Miami as a teenager. His lifelong passion for Latin American art derives from his upbringing.
In the early 1920s, he began collecting paintings by Roberto Matta, Diego Rivera, Wifredo Lam and Joaquín Torres-Garcia. Now, 110 works selected by the museum from Pérez's private collection are available so that everyone can see within the 200,000-square-foot three-story museum, designed by Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron, awarded the Pritzker Prize.
Walk inside the $220 million building and you will be surrounded by high glass windows that are said to be the largest impact-resistant hurricane in the world. Hanged from all sides of the museum there are 70 hydroponic gardens, designed by French landscaper Patrick Blanc.
The museum focuses on the international art of the 20th and 21st centuries, and is currently showing the Chinese artist-activist Ai Weiwei According to What? collection.
PAMM is one of the main attractions of what was known as Bicentennial Park, now Museum Park -- which will also host the Patricia and Phillip Frost Science Museum, which will open in 2015.
The Pérez Art Museum had a soft opening last year, except for a small hiccups: name it.
While most council members voted in favour of naming the museum after Perez, four resigned in protest. Looks like they had their heart set at the Miami Art Museum.
That's because $100 million of the $167 million raised was taxpayers' money from the city and county and the city of Miami donated the land facing the sea where PAMM sits. Some of the board members argued that the name of the museum should represent the city's central art museum.
I can't speak for the others. However, the vast majority of the board was supportive. At a meeting of 47, 43 voted for the change of name, Perez said.
Pérez has been involved with the museum for a long time before the construction project began and said it is an honor for the board to have chosen to recognize it that way.
I think most people want to be reminded of the causes they feel are worthwhile and helped promote, Pérez said.
It seemed strange that PAMM received its share of the struggle to name it as a donor when just a few years ago the name of the Miami Science Museum was changed to that of Patricia and Phillip Frost Museum of Science after a generous donor who gave $35 million to build the new museum in Museum Park.
The name change has been very well received by the community. Patricia and Phillip Frost are highly appreciated people and symbolize what we are, said Gillian Thomas, President and CEO of Patricia and Phillip Frost Museum of Science.
When it comes to naming rights, perhaps Miami takes its art more seriously than science.
People have opinions about art, while science is a little more concrete, so there would be no reaction to name a building as a donor, Thomas said.
But, he points out, naming the Miami art museum after Pérez brings a sense of pride to the Hispanic community, even though their art donation does not represent a collection.
Jorge Pérez is the first major donor of the Hispanic community, Thomas said.
Other American art museums have been named donors, such as the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, and have not sparked any controversy.
Although people may disagree on one name, Thomas said, everyone can see that downtown Miami is rapidly becoming a center for science and art, meaning that donations are needed.
So far that does not seem to be a problem for the Pérez Art Museum; it has reached 90% in its $220 million capital campaign.

"Last April, John made a trip to Las Vegas, Nevada. Las Vegas is a popular destination in the western part of the United States. The city is more popular for its casinos, hotels and exciting nightlife.
In downtown Las Vegas, John spent a lot of time on The Strip, which is a 2.5 mile stretch of shops, entertainment venues, luxury hotels and dining experiences. This is probably the most visited tourist area in the city. The strip at night looks especially beautiful. All buildings are illuminated with light, neon and eye-catching signs to attract the visitor's attention.
A stay in Las Vegas may feel similar to a visit to many popular cities around the world. Many of the hotels have miniature versions of important international sites and monuments. These famous monuments include the Eiffel Tower, Venice and even ancient Rome.
One day, John made a side trip out of town to visit the Grand Canyon, one of the Seven Wonders of the Natural World.

"If we look around at the things we have bought at some point in our lives, we would certainly notice that not everything we own is being put to good use: the thick wool coat that we thought seemed fashionable even though we lived in a tropical country, the smartphone that was saved when we bought the newest model, the car that is only used on weekends, or even the guest room in our house that somehow became a warehouse.
Those underutilized items may seem useless to some, but they could be an asset to others. With the advent of the Internet, online communities have discovered a way to generate benefits from the distribution of these underutilized assets. Using websites and social media groups that facilitate the purchase and sale of second-hand goods, it is now easier than ever for peer-to-peer exchange activities to take place. And this is known as the shared economy.
These democratized online platforms are providing an opportunity for people to win a dollar or two. To give an example, previously occupied parents have not bothered to establish a position on the local market or selling car boots to sell their children's old equipment, but with online markets, parents are now able to sell on those barely worn baby clothes that their children have overcome and the expensive strollers and baby equipment they have invested in, in order to put some money in their pockets.
Companies have also acquired the profitability of the delivery economy and are seeking to benefit from the use of underutilized resources. A business model that has grown rapidly in popularity sees companies providing an online platform that puts customers in contact with those who can provide a particular product or service. Companies like Airbnb act as intermediaries for people to charge in their unused rooms and houses and let them out as lucrative accommodation. Another example is Uber, which encourages people to use their own personal cars as taxis to make some extra money in their free time.
This move towards a shared economy is not without criticism. Unlike companies, unregulated people do not have to follow certain regulations, which can lead to poorer and incoherent quality of goods and services and a greater risk of fraud. However, in the consumerist society in which we live today, increasing opportunities to sell our unwanted and underutilized goods can have a lesser impact on our environment.",B2
"Rosa Parks is an excellent example of how an ordinary American can change the world around him. He was born in 1913, in the southern state of Alabama. Parks became famous for challenging a discriminatory policy in the city of Montgomery, Alabama. During the 1950s, Black Americans in the South were not allowed to travel in the front seats of public buses if a white person needed that seat. Blacks were expected to leave their seats and head to the back of the bus, which was designated as ""Only Colored.""

On December 1, 1955, Parks refused to obey the bus drivers' order to hand over their seat to a white passenger who had boarded the bus. Even though Parks was sitting in the Colored Only section, the bus was full, and she was forced by law to give her seat to the white rider. Parks was arrested and charged with civil disobedience. He later said he had grown ""tired of yielding.""
His arrest and subsequent trial made Parks a national symbol for the Civil Rights Movement. His arrest also led to the Boycott Montgomery Bus which was a political and social protest campaign against racial segregation. Although the boycott lasted only 21 days, it was fundamental in the Supreme Court's decision to declare Alabama's practice of segregation unconstitutional.
Parks has remained a symbol for the Civil Rights Movement even after his death in 2005 at the age of 92. She has been called the ""First Lady of Civil Rights,"" by the United States Congress, and ""The Mother of the Freedom Movement."" It has been honored by the U.S. government with prestigious awards such as the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal. She has been honored with her own museum in Michigan, and has received several other civil rights awards both before and after her death.",B2
"Samuel Langhorne Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, is an American writer and comedian. He wrote two of the most significant novels, Tom Sawyer's Adventures, and Huckleberry Finn's Adventures. He grew up in Hannibal, Missouri, which provided the scenarios for his novels.

Clemens had a variety of odd jobs when he was young. He was a journalist, miner, printer apprentice and typewriter, but journalism was what he liked most to do. His writing style earned him praise from critics all over the world. William Faulkner, another great American author, called him ""The Father of American Literature.""
Twain was already a very successful writer when he wrote The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. The main character Tom Sawyer was based on his own child experiences. His best friends were also based on real-life friends with whom Twain grew up. Huckleberry Finn, the main character of his best work, also relied on a childhood friend.
Twain was a prolific writer who wrote several books, and other publications. Most of his writing was taken from his life in the western part of the United States while traveling with his brother Orion. He was born a Christian, but later in life he questioned his faith, and developed negative feelings toward organized religion. He was once quoted as saying, ""If Christ were here, now there is one thing that would not be - Christian."" Twain died in 1910 of a heart attack at the age of 74.

"These days many people attend community universities with plans to transfer to a four-year university or university to obtain a bachelor's degree. It's like a step. There are many reasons why people do this. One reason is that some community colleges have transfer agreements with private and state colleges and universities that guarantee admission. Even if a community university does not have that guaranteed place agreement at a four-year university, it has articulation agreements with four-year schools. These agreements tell you exactly what classes a student at a community college needs to take in order to be able to transfer. These agreements ensure that students do not waste time taking classes that are not transferred. Most of these classes you need to take before transferring are general education classes, such as mathematics and English.

Another reason why many students start their bachelor's degree at a community university is financial. A four-year college is much more expensive than a two-year college. This is especially true for immigrant students, who do not qualify for financial aid, loans or scholarships. Community universities also tend to offer more night classes so that they can accommodate people who have to work while attending school. They are also a good option for older students with families, who need a more flexible schedule while taking care of children. Community universities also tend to be nearby schools, which means that people don't have to live on campus in dormitories. Attending a community college means you can still live at home with your parents, which can save the family a huge amount of money.
If a student doesn't do well in high school, a community school would give him another chance to enter a four-year college. Community universities offer many classes to help students develop their math and writing skills. When you attend a four-year college, you're expected to have those skills already. The community college will prepare students to successfully graduate from a four-year school.",B2
"In the United States, 43 states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, all have their own lottery. A lottery is used for states to raise money. Authorized stores sell numbered tickets, or people can pay to choose their own numbers. When a machine is allowed to choose its numbers, it is usually called a quick selection. Many people play lucky numbers, numbers associated with birth dates, or other important numbers for them. The money earned from selling lottery tickets is going to pay for schools, roads, bridges and other public services. Once a week or more, a drawing is made where numbers are randomly selected. If your ticket has those numbers, you could win a cash prize.

There are different types of lotteries, such as Powerball, Mega Millions and Lotto. Powerball and Mega Millions are known for their large payouts. There are also instant lottery tickets that are scratch cards. Profits tend to be less money, but they are extremely popular.
In the United States, you can play the lottery or buy a ticket if you are 18 years old or older. If you win, you usually have the option of being paid the full amount in a lump sum or being paid smaller amounts for a number of years. Lottery winnings are taxable, which means that the amount you get is less than the number of the jackpot. People can buy lottery tickets or play lottery at many convenience stores. Lotteries are also very popular as they advertise. There are many TV ads, radio ads, and billboards that urge people to play.
Lotteries have been controversial as they are essentially a legalized form of gambling. There is a concern that this can lead to people becoming addicted to gambling. There are also illegal lottery games, usually led by some forms of organized crime.",B2

"Two days after the kidnapping of a Philadelphia woman was captured on video, police say they have a lead across the state line: Someone used their bank card Tuesday morning in Maryland.
A man used the Carlesha Freeland-Gaither ATM card at 6:01 a.m. a bank in Aberdeen, Maryland, about 75 miles southwest of Philadelphia Street, where he was forced into a car on Sunday night, Philadelphia police chief Inspector Dennis Wilson told reporters.
Wilson didn't say how the card was used or if cash was withdrawn. But he said the surveillance video showed a man similar to the man the police say dragged and kidnapped the 22-year-old woman on Sunday night.
News of that clue came shortly before Freeland-Gaither's family publicly pleaded with whoever took it.
Please give it back. “We just want Carlesha to return us safely,” her grandmother Ana Mulero said at a press conference with Wilson in Philadelphia. Just give it back to us. We're his family. He's got a family here. We need her.
The police did not immediately release the bank video. But before the authorities released a video that they say shows Freeland-Gaither being harassed by a stranger in the Germantown-Penn Knox area of Philadelphia around 9:40 p.m. on Sunday.
That video, released on Monday, shows a man approaching a woman near an intersection and then grabbing her and dragging her down a street towards the camera.
The posted recording does not include audio, but one witness reported that Freeland-Gaither shouted for help, police said.
The video shows Freeland-Gaither on the ground with his kidnapper and being forced into a four-door vehicle, which police say may be a grey Ford Taurus.
His glasses and cell phone were thrown onto the road during the fight. Just before the vehicle withdrew, Freeland-Gaither broke one of the passenger side windows, the police said.
The police described the kidnapper as an unknown black man with heavy median construction, aged 25 to 30 years. The video shows you a dark jacket with hood, dark hat and dark pants.
Freeland-Gaither's family told CNN affiliate WPVI that she worked as a nurse and was a few blocks from her home when she was kidnapped.
Investigators are not sure if he knew his kidnapper, although there is no indication in the Philadelphia surveillance video that he did, Wilson said. The police have not spoken publicly of a possible motive.
Authorities initially said the kidnapper's car had a Pennsylvania license plate, but Wilson said Tuesday that investigators are investigating whether a Maryland license plate was in front of the car. The badge is not easily readable in the video, and the police said no witnesses gave them a badge number.
Mulero said her granddaughter lived with her for four years in Maryland before Freeland-Gaither returned to Philadelphia to be with other relatives and pursue a career.
Officials are offering $42,000 rewards for information leading to the resolution of the case, including $25,000 from the FBI, which is helping with the investigation, Wilson said.

Born Clara Ann Fowler, Page was the best-selling female artist of the 1950s and had 19 gold and 14 platinum singles. Page landed on the charts 111 times, and its mix of genres made it a traditional pop icon. She scored her first million-sales song in 1950 with With My Eyes Wide Open, I'm Dreaming, and sang hits like -LRB- How much is that -RRB-Doggie in the window and Old Cape Cod. His main song, Tennessee Waltz, later became an official Tennessee state song, and his popularity led to his own TV shows on CBS, NBC and ABC in the 1950s and film roles in the 1960s.

"Madonna Louise Ciccone is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. Madonna, as it is commonly known, broke into the music scene in the early 1980s with a style that had never been seen before. His sexy and sparsely dressed costumes and performances enchanted and aggravated the American public for years. She excelled in pushing the limits of what most Americans perceived as acceptable in their music videos and live performances. Madonna also did not shy away from controversial issues.

Madonna was born in Bay City, Michigan in 1958. He moved to New York City to pursue a career at the young dance. She began her musical career with a couple of club bands in New York, but was soon noticed by music industry executives. In 1983, he released his first album entitled simply ""Madonna"". This was just the start for the superstar. She continued her initial success with several albums and singles such as Like a Virgin, and Into the Groove. He associated his commercial success in music with successful performances in a series of films such as Desperately Seeking Susan, and Evita. There seemed to be nothing Madonna couldn't do.
One of Madonna's defining features is her ability to reinvent herself. Many artists find success in the very competitive entertainment industry, but most are only successful for a short period of time, but not Madonna. It has sold more than 300 million records worldwide to date. She was second only to the Beatles on the Billboard list of Greatest Acts of the 20th Century.
Madonna's career has not been uncontroversial, however. She has been the subject of several lawsuits for her actions, but she survived, and prospered through everything. She is still one of the best female artists in the United States today.",B2
"Sam squinted his eyes against the sun on the distant trail of dust torn by the car on his way to the Big House. The horses kicked and hit their tails against the flies, not worrying about their owner's first visit in ten months. Sam waited. Mr. Carter didn't come here unless he had to, which was fine with Sam. The longer he stayed out of his boss's way, the longer he'd have a job.
Carter came later while Sam was cutting wood. Carter lifted his hat as if he were waiting for a date with the city priest, and then removed it completely as if he were talking to his mother. He pulled a lot of paper out of his back pocket and held it up.
'You don't pick up your mail often, do you?'
Sam took it without taking a look and dropped the envelopes in the bank.
""Never,"" he answered and waited for Carter to say why he was here. The fact that it was Carter's house wasn't an explanation, and they both knew it. Carter twisted his hat around and around, licking his lips and clearing his throat.
'Good job fixing those fences,' he finally said.
'I'll be back at first soon,' Sam said. It wasn't a complaint. A fence that took a year to repair meant another year of work for the man who did well.
'Don't you ever want to take a vacation?'
And where to? A vacation means being back in the real world, a place that even people like Carter traveled to escape from. Sam's escape was his reality and he wasn't coming back.
Mr. Carter wiped his neck sweat. The wet patches on his shirt were put together as shapes on an atlas. Her skin was already turning reddish in the June sun. Otherwise, he had the inner tan of a man who earned money while other people did the work.
I brought my son with me on this trip. He's had some problems at school. Mr. Carter's eyes rose, blinked quickly and then returned to the hat that occupied his hands. There's not much trouble here for a child. He tried to laugh, but he came out like a dog bark.
The two men looked to the north end of the property. It stretched as far as the eye could see. Even the fences were barely visible from where they were. As boring and rebellious as he might become a teenager, it was not possible to escape on foot. Sam looked at the biggest of the horses, kicking on the floor with their heavy helmets. Could the boy ride? He was wondering. There was a lot of trouble that a good rider could get in here, miles away from anyone. But maybe there was more trouble for someone who knew nothing about horses and wanted to get away from their father.",B2
"From all over Rwanda, and even parts of neighbouring Burundi, people go to the southern city of Butare to a small shop called Inzozi Nziza (Dulce Dreams). They come to taste the unknown, something most have never tasted: the sweet, cold and velvety embrace of ice cream.
Here, in the first ice cream shop in the Central African country, customers can buy spoonfuls of sweet cream, passion fruit, strawberry and pineapple flavors. Ingredients include fresh fruit, honey, chocolate fries and granola. Black tea and coffee are also for sale.
The store, which has “ice, coffee, dreams” through its signage, is milking local curiosity about dessert – and “changing lives” in the process, says Inzozi Nziza manager Louise Ingabire.
“Ice cream is important,” he says in between bites of a honey-flavored offering. “Some Rwandans like ice cream, but it’s something new. We still have some work to do, to tell others that they will enjoy it.”
True to Inzozi Nziza's motto, the store can certainly make dreams come true. “I didn’t have a job before: I just stayed home. Now, I have a vision for the future. I’m making money and I can give something to my family,” says the 27-year-old.
Butare, which has 89,600 residents and is 135 km south of the capital, Kigali, is home to the National University of Rwanda. Inzozi Nziza has become a center for tired students who seek to treat themselves to something fresh and different.
“It’s something that unites people here,” says Kalisa Migendo, a 24-year-old agricultural student. “If you need to go out and talk to a friend, girl or child, you come to Inzozi Nziza for an ice cream.”
Most of the ingredients are locally sourced and the milk comes from a deposit in nearby Nyanza. Vanilla beans and cocoa are imported.
Inzozi Nziza was opened by theatre director Odile Gakire Katese. She met Alexis Miesen and Jennie Dundas, co-founders of Blue Marble Ice Cream in Brooklyn, New York, and formed an association to open the store in 2010.
“An ice cream shop, Katese proposed, could help rebuild human pieces by rebuilding spirits, hopes and family traditions,” says Miesen.
At first, Miesen and Dundas owned the store in association with their staff and had shares in the business, which is a cooperative and non-profit. They did not set financial targets, but waited 18 months before transferring their shares to the women, who by then had demonstrated their commercial credentials.
The success of the store is no exception, says Fatuma Ndangiza, deputy executive director of the Rwandan Government Board. “Small businesses are mainly run by women, but when it comes to large companies where you have to compete for large tenders, very few women are there. Women are newcomers to big business,” she says. “We have more women entrepreneurs. It is an area where women are interested, both inside and outside Kigali.”
Although ice cream is something new in Rwanda, Ndangiza is excited about the idea of the store. “I think it’s great. It requires a lot of skills and changing people's mentality because selling and eating ice cream is not part of our culture. I think being able to innovate and introduce this into the market, and the process of doing so, is quite interesting.”
The Butare store employs nine women, who spend their free time practicing with Ingoma Nshya, Rwanda's first and only female drum company, which was established by Katese ten years ago.
The musicians are Hutu and Tutsi women, some survivors of the 1994 genocide, during which almost a million moderate Tutsis and Hutus were killed.
Some members of Ingoma Nshya are widows, some orphans. Others have been affected by the massacre in different ways.
Historically, Ingabire says, Rwandan women were banned from playing drums and many people considered the drums too heavy for women to carry. “But it’s something that brings unity.”
Ingabire's father, two brothers and many cousins were killed in the genocide. “Some of us are survivors; some of us know someone who was murdered,” he says. “When I’m playing with them, it gives me power because we’re still alive and alive.”
The popular restaurant is featured in a documentary by Rob and Lisa Fruchtman, film-makers' brothers. Sweet Dreams, which tells the story of how women have forged a promising post-genocide future, also includes female drummers.
The film, which has been screened in more than a dozen countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and several African states, premiered in Rwanda in 2014. “We feel that the film is about resilience, hope, courage, ingenuity and the ability to change the course of your own life,” says Lisa Fruchtman, who won an Academy Award for film editing in 1984.

"LRB-CNN-RRB- The family of James McNair, the late comedian known as Jimmy Mack, has settled a lawsuit with Walmart for the car accident that killed him and injured his partner Tracy Morgan, says McNair's family.
McNair's sister Pamela McNair said the agreed amount is confidential, but it was satisfactory to all parties.
There is no value, no amount of dollars, in my brother's life at all, he said. But in terms of finances, it will help the family a lot to continue living life.
McNair was Jamel's 26-year-old father and Danita was 19 and he was the oldest of the seven brothers he cared for a lot, Pamela said.
“There is nothing we can do to change what happened,” Walmart said. Walmart and the McNair family have worked closely together to reach an agreement. Walmart continues to work with others involved in the accident and we will continue to do the right thing.
Last June, a limousine bus carrying Morgan, McNair and his companions was cornered by a Walmart truck on the New Jersey highway. The accident killed McNair and left Morgan with a serious brain injury and his colleagues with other injuries.
A preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board said that the Walmart truck was traveling 20 mph above the speed limit, and that its driver was almost at its driving time limit.
In July, four parties filed a lawsuit against Walmart, claiming in a complaint that the negligence of the defendants was an important factor contributing to the injury of the plaintiffs.
Pamela McNair said the family will continue with Jameslegacy as a humanitarian, and the finances of the deal will help.
My brother has done a lot for the community. He was a youth mentor for the community, worked at the homeless shelter. The little things he's done really miss each other, McNair said.
He was a great comedian, but he was a good family person in the first place. He loved life and wanted others to love life too. He was a humanitarian.
The mayor of McNair's hometown, Peekskill, New York, has named June 12th in her honor, she said.
Tracy Morgan's lawyer told CNN in November that he was still recovering from the car accident that left him with a serious brain injury and is struggling to get back to the person he once was.
McNair said his family hasn't been in contact with the Morgan family.
“It is a bit heartbreaking,” McNair said. I understand you have your own medical situation, I want the best for him, I'm praying for your recovery, but I felt that someone could have contacted the family... my brother and Tracy had a very long relationship as friends and it's heartbreaking that we haven't heard from anyone.

"Dearly known in his hometown of Madrid as the wise man of Hortaleza, Luis Aragones left the legacy of helping Spain ascend to the top of world football.
Aragones, whose death at the age of 75 was announced on Saturday, trained his national team to the title of the European Championship in 2008, the country's first success in a major tournament in more than 40 years.
This advance was continued by his successor Vicente del Bosque, who continued with the Tiki Taka de paso Aragones style introduced, as La Roja won the 2010 World Cup and the European crown 2012.
Without a doubt, it marked the way in this successful final phase. I was grateful to him, Del Bosque told the official website of the national team.
I knew I had some health problems, but I never imagined it would lead to this.
Always with us, Luis, led the web tribute of Atlético Madrid, the club where Aragones played for a decade between 1964-74 and was lead coach on four occasions, the most recent 2001-03.
He guided Atlético to the title of La Liga in 1977 and to the Spanish Cup on three occasions.
Luis Aragones was a great player and coach, but first of all a great person and a friend, said team president Enrique Cerezo.
First of all, he was Atlético. We would like to express our condolences to your family on behalf of the entire club.
Aragonesfinal's coaching work was with the Turkish side Fenerbahce, which ended in mid-2009, and at the end of last year announced his retirement from the game, in which he began in Getafe in 1957.
He was reportedly taken to a hospital in Madrid last week with a serious illness, from which he did not recover.
The Aragons will be buried in a private ceremony on Sunday. Atlético will observe a minute of silence ahead of the match of house against Real Sociedad, in which the team will seek to climb to the table above another of its old teams, Barcelona.
I wish to express our regret at the loss of one of the best men in football and one of the most charismatic and friendly managers we remember, said Barca President Josep Maria Bartomeu, before the defeat of his team by Valencia, his first home in the league since April 2012.
As a club, we had the honor of their services, although for a very short time, in the 1987-88 season, when we won the Spanish Cup.
We very much appreciate your respect for Barca, his model and our players. The 2008 Euro Cup, with Puyol, Xavi, Iniesta and so many others, is a great example.
Aragonesapreciation of the Tiki Taka style of Barca, initiated by Johann Cruyff and developed by Pep Guardiola, was confirmed by the number of players of the Catalan club that selected for the national team.
But his heart lay in the capital of the nation, where he was in the books of the great rival of Atlético Real Madrid since 1958-60 as a player, although he spent most of that time on loan to other clubs.
The loss of Luis Aragones saddens all soccer lovers, said President Florentino Pérez.
Today is a day of mourning for this sport, but it should also be a day of recognition for a legendary figure who was vital to give us a glorious period with our Spanish selection.
He ennobled this sport and all Spanish fans owe him gratitude and respect. His personal and professional career was always characterized by honesty and hard work.
The only stain on his international career was an incident in 2004, when he was accused of making a racial comment -- which was recorded on television cameras -- about French striker Thierry Henry while trying to motivate his players in training before a World Cup qualifying match.
Aragones was fined by the governing body of European football UEFA and later apologized to Henry, insisting that he had not intended to make a racial insult.

"Five years ago, telling a friend that you regularly interact with a verbose orange traffic cone might earn you a pity hug and a quick trip to the sanatorium.
But these days, your friend might answer that they trade spikes with Rick Santorum's vest.
Welcome to the age of novelty Twitter accounts, where animals, inanimate objects and other non-human entities regularly talk about their mind: A dove with a dirty mouth and a more dirty behavior. The famous mist of San Francisco. Even the universe. On the social-media platform, users can express themselves creatively and laugh by giving voice to those things they cannot speak for themselves.
Non-human accounts of novelty have been a basic element of Twitter since Sockington, a domestic cat in the Boston area, joined the service in March 2007 on his way to 1.4 million followers. But they have appeared on the news again recently after a user created @olympicseat, a chic response to curiously vacant seats in London's Olympic precincts. In the span of a few days, he has accumulated more than 21,000 followers.
Another feed related to the Olympics celebrates the starry towel that American gymnast Danell Leyva covers about himself among the events. It has more than 12,000 followers, not bad, considering that the average Twitter user has 126.
Most people in this group of prominent tweeters say their main motivation for tweeting is to have fun. For others, it is an opportunity to leave its mark on the crowded world of the Web.
However, everyone agrees that there is more thought in his 140-character reflections than is seen at the naked eye.
Cat food
When the woman behind the pet-centric account @CatFoodBreath started her new Twitter account in August 2010, she was not planning to stay.
I thought the best way to test the waters was with a pseudonym, said Burlington resident Vermont, who asked that his name not be published to preserve his Twitter person's anonymity. I wouldn't offend my friends and colleagues if I didn't follow them, and I could make an educated Twitter exit when I was done snooping.
Two years and almost 19,000 followers later, she's still at it. At first, however, she and many other successes in the history of novelty admit that they did not really know what it was.
At first, I didn't know that this account was about a cat, -LSB- but -RSB- while exploring Twitterverse, I soon realized that I had a character that people related to, he said.
Real or not, Cat Food Breath is definitely a character. The cat -LRB- its genus is ambiguous -RRB- writes odes to the sofa, gives orders to its owner with Garfield-like acerbity and complains about the family dog - affectionately called Labradum.
The Mist of San Francisco
Other anonymous Twitter celebrities started their accounts to educate and bring -LRB- hilarious -RRB- consciousness to things that they cannot speak for themselves, like the fog of San Francisco that brings a cold to the summers in that city.
I love everything about the fog, said the man who created @KarlTheFog in August 2010. I think the way he hides on the hills is beautiful, mysterious and even a little romantic. I love how it stops at certain points above the city, creating a wall of clouds. And after moving here from a city where there were more than 100 degrees in the summer, I was excited not to be dripping in sweat for three consecutive months.
The man, who also requested anonymity, was inspired by @BPGlobalPR, a popular parody response to the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Through the lens of Karl the Fog, he reports on the public's feelings towards the fog and acts as a public relations representative for the defamed form of the climate - with an ingenious inclination. Karl already has over 5,000 followers.
Giving Karl an identity has drawn emphatic and sometimes superficial answers, especially when the fog blocked the July 4 fireworks, but Twitterverse has been receptive in general, he said.
- LSB- I have -RSB- a lot of time word games and haikus. My favorite tweets are when people take photos of Karl and post them on Twitter or Instagram, the man said. Seeing so many people take it and label Karl in their photos has been overwhelmingly great.
The Orange Cone
Like Karl the Fog, @TheOrangeCone loves it when followers interact with it online.
The Orange Cone was originally a MySpace account, but came to Twitter after its creator discovered the ingenious Cobra tweets of the Bronx Zoo, last year's famous escape snake, and motorsport satirist @nascarcasm. Today the Orange Cone keeps track of more than 20,000 users a day about NASCAR events.
And his followers respond en masse.
People notice cones in their daily lives and send me pictures by hundreds, said the man behind the Cone, who asked that his name not be used. I find it funny... people stop what they're doing in the real world to take a picture of an orange cone. I love it.
He added, “Every time the cone is hit during the course of a NASCAR race, my power explodes.
When driver Kasey Kahne hit the cone during a February practice in Daytona, Twitterverse came to Orange Cone's aid.
Kasey made an apology on Twitter and I added about 1,200 followers in the next hour, she said. It was crazy.
Remaining in character
For some, the prospect of actually interacting with followers is off the table.
I'm kind of like Banksy. No one knows who I am, said the man behind the bird character @PigeonJon of bad temper, referring to the anonymous artist based in Britain. If possible, I'd like to keep it that way. He wrote CNN in an e-mail.
Apart from that statement, Jon never broke character. Instead, he offered clues to his personality.
I like cookies. I don't like Velcro, he wrote.
The person behind the popular @BronxZoosCobra, who narrates the exploits of a real-life snake who briefly escaped from its enclosure at the New York City Zoo, also refused to break character in an email exchange with CNN. The account has more than 200,000 followers.
The strangest thing that tweeted to the snake, said its creator, was a request for support from a high school student running for the student government. I backed him up, she wrote CNN. He lost. Snake intolerance at its best.
Alter egos online
Many new tweeps with great followers are bewildered by their popularity, which has led them to think about the relationship between the Internet and the real world.
“I have the feeling, and I might be wrong, that the people who follow The Orange Cone find it to be more real than some of the drivers on the track,” his creator said. They can arrive and in most cases get an answer. And the fact that no one knows who he is, which means that he could be anyone, just adds to the mystery and enjoyment.
He added the man behind KarlTheFog, I think people in the Bay Area like Karl because the fog was already a character in their lives. In a world that is becoming more and more personalized, you can surround yourself with a cast of friends on the Internet that matches your exact interests and sense of humor.
Being Karl has challenged him to think about sports, pop culture and politics in ridiculous ways, he said.
It forces me to be disciplined by sticking to a subject. Since my work is not creative by nature, it gives me the opportunity to be as resourceful as I want.
Other Twitter users say that embodying non-human entities gives them the opportunity to create alter egos. “The Cone can say and do the things I think we all wish we could do,” his creator said.
The man behind @WeirdHorse, a decidedly strange flow of reflections on, well, horse life, thinks he knows why his 137,000 followers appreciate his peculiar humor.
It's a breath of fresh air because it's not malicious, he said. It is not forced by a brand with an agenda or a political motive and is capricious, discarded and easy to digest. People respond well to that kind of thing.
Whimsical, yes. But let's be honest: @WeirdHorse may have a small agenda.
The recent demand for Strange Horse T-shirts and mugs from my site... has been another advantage, he said.

"There are worse things to do in life than stroll along the Copacabana beach of Rio under the sun on the way to watch a World Cup match, so maybe it wasn't surprising that England's fan Anthony McDowell of Liverpool wasn't having any of the fatality and dimness that preceded part of the tournament's accumulation in Brazil. “The place is lovely. People are great. There’s a party atmosphere,” McDowell said. “The only thing that could be better is the England team.”
He and half a dozen friends are among the crowds of supporters from all over the world who have made the beach a party area of colors and national songs. Some danced, others posed for the photos, others drank, but mostly they just walked and talked about football, hoping the next game would start on FanFest's nearby big screen. The last time there were so many people here during the day, the Pope was visiting.
The cheerful, largely peaceful mood was far from the protests, the chaos of transportation and the stadium problems that plagued preparations for the World Cup. But, now that football is well and truly underway, visiting fans are determined to enjoy the experience. “If I had known, when I started planning, how complicated and costly it would be, I would not have come. But now that we’re here, it’s great,” said Brian Hill, a retired Sunderland executive.
The trip hasn't been trouble-free. Hill travelled for more than 20 hours to reach Rio, then suffered long road delays from the airport at 6:30 am. His son, Andrew, had his sunglasses stolen almost as soon as he sat on the beach. And, they have been surprised that many bars are not installed with large screens for games. But, like many fans, they said they loved the atmosphere, if not the logistics, of this tournament that has had a spectacular start in the field.
Even the most shrewd cynic can't help but get excited by Robin van Persie's extraordinary headboard for the Netherlands against Spain. In other places, there has been an excess of goals: 28 in the first eight games, almost three times more than at the same stage in South Africa in 2010. Adding to the carnival mood in the streets, where most fans are from neighboring nations, Latin American teams won in every game they played until the time they wrote.
So far, the tournament has avoided the worst scenarios of Judgment Day, although it is far from trouble-free. Stadiums may have been delivered late and, in some cases, not completely completed, but there have been no reports of structural problems or difficulties entering the field from the start.
As in previous World Cups, tickets have been a problem, with many empty seats in several games, including the Netherlands against Spain. FIFA spokesman Saint-Clair Milesi confirmed that only 48,000 of the 51,900 seats on the floor were filled. FIFA is also investigating security flaws that allowed Chilean fans to fire fireworks during their victory over Australia.
The newspaper Globo listed a number of shortcomings in the 12 host cities. Almost all suffered worse traffic congestion than usual. The worst transport problems were in Natal, where bus drivers have been on strike since June 12. In Salvador, some travel times were five times longer than usual. “The traffic was already bad, but this week is chaotic,” Jecilda Mello, president of the group of residents of the Association of Friends of the Historic Center, told the newspaper.
However, protests have declined since the opening day, when small demonstrations took place in several cities, leading the police to use tear gas and pepper spray. Since then, the only security threat has been petty theft and overly excited fans. A spontaneous street party of Argentine fans was dispersed with pepper spray after the fans blocked the roads.
The huge distances have led to some highly contrasted World Cup experiences. The tournament has made only a small mark in São Paulo, the most populous city in South America, but far away in Manaus – the remote Amazonian city where England played Italy – visitors said the World Cup fever was in full swing with brightly decorated streets and flags waving in many cars.
FA president Greg Dyke said the mood change was palpable. “We have had a warm welcome in Manaus. It's a great thing for them, even if it's a little strange to spend so much on a stadium without anyone to play on it. But we were in São Paulo for four or five days in the run-up to the inaugural match and you wouldn't have known until the last day that there was even a World Cup. It was weird.”",B2
"The British tourist who caught a 1-year-old boy who fell from the balcony on the fourth floor of a hotel in Orlando, Florida, was honored by the government and business leaders on Friday.
Officers believe Helen Beard is thinking quickly of saving Jah-Nea Myleslife. Barba was in the pool area of the Econo Lodge Inn and Suites around 9:15 on Thursday night when, after hearing horrible screams, she looked up to see a little boy hanging from a balcony of the hotel.
“We heard screams and turned around,” Beard, 44, said, a mother who was on vacation with her partner, Philip Charlesworth, and her 10-year-old son, Ben. I was able to run over Jah-Nea, he said.
Beard said it looked like the girl slipped through a railing along the balcony walkway, MPs told CNN affiliate WKMG.
See hotel and how far the child fell
A few hours later, Beard, a health service analyst, was honored for her heroic actions. The Orange County Sheriff's Department, the International Chamber of Commerce and the State Department of Children and Families awarded him a Medal of Merit for showing unusual instinct and initiative when he took action.
It all happened so fast, Barba said, that he was still shocked by all the attention. I sat down with her and tried to calm her down while everyone was panicking around me.
Helena Myles, the child's mother, said she left her daughter with a friend in a motel room, according to WKMG. The friend, Dominique Holt, said he went to use the bathroom and then found the door of the hotel room open after hearing screams, the sheriff's office said.
A woman in the hotel room with Holt said she didn't know the child was there, according to the agents.
No charges have been brought in the case.

"Help dripped Thursday, three days after a magnitude-7.7 earthquake hit Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that killed at least 311 people and left more than 400 missing.
An assessment team of the non-profit group SurfAid International had arrived in the disaster area, but the remoteness of the area prevented further contact with the headquarters in Sumatera Barat, Indonesia.
SurfAid had sent 1,000 shelter kits to the victims, and is preparing to send more supplies once communication is established, spokesman Jossi Syahrial said on Thursday.
He said that the group was working with government officials to establish an information and coordination centre for all non-governmental organizations.
The Mentawai Islands region is one of Indonesia's countless islands.
It is very difficult to reach the region either by boat or by road, said Andrew Judge, CEO of SurfAid.
The trip lasts at least 10 hours in good condition, according to aid agencies.
The Indonesian Red Cross has also sent at least two aid teams. An aid shipment included about 400 body bags.
Urgent needs are expected to include safe drinking water, food, blankets, clothing, medical care, emergency shelter and hygiene kits, said Ita Balanda, program manager of the World Vision aid organization in Padang, Indonesia.
It is estimated that 7,900 households were affected, he said.
The most affected area is North and South Pagai Island. Reports of flattened villages come from there, said Antorizon, from the Western Sumatra disaster management agency, which like many Indonesians bear a name.
The first images of North Pagai Island showed damaged and flattened structures.
Monday's earthquake generated a significant tsunami, said Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. Some of the missing persons may include missing persons after fleeing to higher ground, said Henri Dori Satoko, head of the Mentawai Islands parliament.
Although communication poses a challenge in the remote area, some witnesses in Western Sumatra reported seeing a wave of 6 meters - LRB- almost 20 feet -RRB- high. Other reports described the tsunami as about 3 meters - LRB- nearly 10 feet -RRB- high.
At least one village with a population of about 200 people was razed, with only 40 people recovered, Satoko said.
The earthquake struck at 9:42 p.m. Monday, triggering a tsunami warning. Its epicenter was 240 kilometers -LRB- 150 miles -RRB- south of Padang, at a depth of 20.6 kilometers -LRB- 12.8 miles -RRB-, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The magnitude was revised upwards from a preliminary magnitude of 7.5.
In Mentawai, a tsunami-LSB-RSB warning was issued seven minutes after earthquake detection, which is what the existing system is capable of doing. The preliminary report indicates that the destructive waves hit the Mentawai Islands after five minutes... For the villagers of Mentawai, the warning is late, as they are very close to the source of the tsunami, said Sanny Jegillos of the United Nations Development Programme. It monitors the Indian Ocean tsunami warning system, including Indonesia.
Since then, the Indonesian government has warned residents of West Sumatra Province to stay alert and away from the coast for up to five days due to the possibility of further earthquakes, Balanda said.
The city of Padang and the Mentawai Islands are at the meeting point of two tectonic plates, making them vulnerable to earthquakes and tsunamis.
On 26 December 2004, a 9.1 magnitude earthquake struck northern Sumatra. A tsunami generated by that earthquake killed more than 225,000 people in 14 countries, mainly India, Indonesia, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand. The Indonesian region of Banda Aceh was severely beaten: about 150,000 died there.

"Egypt's revolution has made life even harder for the 80,000 taxi drivers in Cairo, struggling to make a living in the chaotic, congested and congested streets of the city, says the author who has written a best-selling book about them.
Khaled AlKhamissi's novel Taxi, first published in 2006, has been translated into 10 languages. It has 58 fictional monologues with taxi drivers recreated from their own experience. A new post-revolution English edition has just been published.
Despite Egypt's optimism after President Hosni Mubarak was overthrown in February, AlKhamissi said taxi drivers, and the rest of the country's poor, have suffered more since then.
My taxi drivers are among 55% of the population living below the $2-a-day poverty line, AlKhamissi said. That 55% wasn't on the streets during the revolution and now it doesn't have a real voice.
They're wise, they're watching, they're analyzing, but they're not acting.
He added: Life has changed for them in the wrong direction. It's worse for them because we don't have security and living on the streets without security is dangerous.
There's less tourism and more chaos on the streets.
AlKhamissi said it was too early to say whether life was improving for the middle classes who took to the streets during the revolution.
We are in the middle of a battle, and during the battle we cannot see whether life is improving or not, he said.
AlKhamissi, whose second novel Noah's Ark, also a bestseller, was published in 2009, said he stopped writing his third novel at the beginning of the uprising on January 25 of this year and has not been able to concentrate on writing since.
It is impossible to write because my mind is taken with what is happening day after day, hour after hour, he said.
Since January, AlKhamissi has filled his time with a weekly column of newspapers, conferences and speaking events. But the author wants to rewrite fiction.
Every night I want to write because it's my only job, my only happiness, he said. I have to find a solution soon or I'll die.
According to its publisher Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation, the taxi was credited with a single reliving an interest in reading in Egypt, but AlKhamissi denies that his book is responsible.
He said: Some journalists have said that about my book, but it makes no sense to say that a book or 10 books can change reading habits.
Reading has increased over the past six years, but it has taken many social factors. We have had a cultural revolution in the last six years in all matters: theater, music, fiction and editing.
This cultural revolution is related to the youth who are looking for a dream.
AlKhamissi said he dreams of an Egypt where taxi drivers can have the time and education to read his book, or anyone else.
They don't have time to read because they're struggling to survive, he said. When we can increase the quality of education and reduce poverty, then you will be able to read. I don't care if they read my book, I just hope they read something.
Another novelist accredited with the change of reading habits in Egypt is Ahmed Khaled Towfik, a 49-year-old medical professor described by Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation as the best-selling author of fantasy and horror in the Arab world. He's written over 200 books, selling millions of copies.
He said he was one of the first Egyptian authors to write for young people.
Twenty years ago there was nothing to read for 16, 17, 18 years, Towfik said. We invented popular literature. I think I made young people like to read.
I think most of my readers were in Tahrir Square. I changed a part of his thinking, although that cannot be compared to his economic disappointment or the scourge of the police system.
Towfik Utopia's book, which has just been published in English, is a grim futuristic account of Egyptian society in 2023 with wealthy communities isolated from external poverty.
Towfik said that despite Egypt's revolution, he still fears that the scenes in his book, first published in Arabic in 2009, can come true.
The first uprising came from the middle class, but I think another bloody one might come from the lower classes, as described in my book Utopia.
I still think there's a danger that my book will come true.
He added: After nine months, nothing has been achieved except getting rid of Mubarak. We got rid of the snake's head, but the snake's body keeps governing everything.

"After about 30 hours of deliberation, on Monday a jury convicted music producer Phil Spector for second-degree murder in the death of actress Lana Clarkson more than six years ago.
Phil Spector will not be released on bail until his sentence of May 29.
In a black suit with a red tie and a square pocket, Spector showed no reaction while the verdict was being announced. Now 69, he faces a sentence of 18 years to life imprisonment when he is sentenced on 29 May.
When asked if he agreed with the date of the sentence, Spector replied quietly: Yes.
Attorney Alan Jackson said he believed the jury had reached the correct verdict, and recognized the strength and support of Clarkson's family. But defense attorney Doron Weinberg said Spector's defense team disagreed and planned to appeal.
“We do not believe that justice has been done,” Weinberg said.
High Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler refused to allow Spector to remain on bail until sentence was handed down, citing the pattern of violence years ago that Spector involved firearms. Watch the lawyers give their opinion on the verdict
This was not an isolated incident, said Fidler, pointing to Spector's two previous convictions related to firearms from the 1970s. Taking an innocent human life doesn't get more serious than that.
Spector's wife, Rachelle, was in court to hear the verdict on Monday, just like Clarkson's mother, Donna.
Clarkson, 40, was found dead, collapsed in a chair in the hall of the Alhambra in Spector, California, a mansion with a gunshot wound to the roof of her mouth in February 2003.
A mistrial was declared in Spector's first trial in September 2007. After 15 days of deliberation, the jurors told Fidler that they could not reach a verdict. Spector was also charged with second-degree murder in that trial. Juries stalled 10-2 in favor of conviction.
To conclude the arguments in the new trial, prosecutor Truc Do called Spector a very dangerous man who has a history of playing Russian roulette with women, six women. Lana's just been sixth.
Weinberg argued that the prosecution case depended on circumstantial evidence. He said the possibility of Clarkson committing suicide could not be ruled out.
However, he pointed out to the jurors that Clarkson bought new shoes on the day of his death, something a suicide woman would not have done, the prosecutor said.
A woman who refused to be identified told reporters that the jurors considered all the evidence and testimonies to reach their verdict.
“This whole jury took it so seriously,” he said with tears in his eyes, before adding that it is difficult to be on a jury, because someone else’s life is in the hands of the jury.
Clarkson starred in the 1985 B-Movie Barbarian Queen film and appeared in many other films, including DeathStalker, Blind Date, Scarface, Fast Times at Ridgemont High and the Amazon Women on the Moon Spoof. She worked as a VIP hostess at Hollywood's House of Blues at the time of her death.
In the 2007 trial, Spector's lawyers argued that Clarkson was depressed by a recent break-up and took a 38-caliber pistol to commit suicide while at Spector's house.
But prosecution witnesses painted Spector as a weapon threat. Five women took the stand and claimed that he had threatened them with firearms. His driver testified that he heard a loud noise and saw the producer leave the house, with the gun in his hand, saying, I think I killed someone.
Spector's new trial began in October. Fidler ruled that jurors could consider the slightest charge of manslaughter against Spector.
Spector's professional trademark was the Wall of Sound, the layer of instrumental tracks and percussion that sustained a series of successes on his Philles label, named after Spector and his business partner, Lester Sill, in the early 1960s. iReport.com: What do you think of this verdict?
The roaring arrangements were the heart of what he called little symphonies for children -- including No. 1 hits like the Ronettes Be My Baby and the righteous brothers you've lost that LovinFeelin.
Spector co-produced the final album by Beatles, Let It Be, and worked with ex-Beatles George Harrison and John Lennon on solo projects after the band split up. His recording of the 1971 Harrison benefit concert for war relief in Bangladesh won the 1972 Grammy Award for the album of the year.
Spector has won two Grammy Awards and was included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989, but remained out of the public eye for two decades before his arrest in 2003 in Clarkson's death.

"Having your child physically attached to you probably doesn't sound like fun, but an American pediatrician, William Sears, promotes a parenting style that keeps young children as physically united as possible. This is called the attachment of parents.

The idea behind parental attachment is that if a young baby feels protected and secure by physical contact with his parents, especially his mother, that child will grow up to be a more independent adult. One way parents are encouraged to be close to their babies is by wearing a sling or coat to take the baby instead of putting him in a carriage. This is often called ""wearing"" of your baby. Parents are also encouraged to sleep with their babies. Parents are too big to fit in a crib, so instead parents are told to take the baby to the adult bed. This is supposed to teach the baby about sleep regulation, as well as since the baby will learn to imitate adult sleep patterns. However, this co-bedroom is controversial. There is concern that babies sleeping with adults may suffocate, be accidentally crushed, or fall out of bed. There is also concern about sudden death syndrome in infants, or SIDS, where babies suddenly stop breathing.
Another indicator of parental attachment is not to worry about spoiling a baby. Many times parents feel that paying attention to every cry of a baby makes them too needy or spoiled. Parenting feels that each baby's cry should be answered and that the baby should never be left to ""weep."" Instead, the baby should be comforted and crying should be taken as a sign that the baby needs something. Most parents who stick to the demand also breastfeed, feeling that this is not only physically healthier, but also promotes a link between the mother and the child.",B2
"Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin, known by many people more as an aggrieved movie character or perceived tax evader than as a real person, has finally spoken.
In an interview with a magazine in his family's native Brazil, Saverin, a billionaire just minted after Facebook's public stock offer, spoke about his taxes, his relationship with co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and life after The Social Network.
Many observers believe that Saverin, who, according to the history of Facebook's origin was despised by Zuckerberg as the site grew, was a primary source for the book The Accidental Billionaires, on which the Social Network is based.
Surprise: Internet hates rich people
But the end result was fantasy, he said. And, no, he never threw an angry laptop at Zuckerberg as his Hollywood counterpart, Andrew Garfield, did in the movie. It is a statement Fabio Altman, from Veja magazine, writes is instantly credible given Saverin's reserved nature.
That's Hollywood, not a documentary, says 30-year-old Saverin in an interview at his multimillion-dollar residence in Singapore.
Saverin filed a lawsuit against Facebook for its reduced stake in the company, and the legal dispute was settled outside the courts. But despite the well-documented friction over the years, Saverin says he has no ill-will towards Zuckerberg.
“I can only speak well of Mark; it does not bother me,” Saverin said. His approach from day one to day is admirable. He was a visionary and always knew that Facebook would only grow if it remained true to his central idea of people who presented themselves truly and without pseudonyms.
That is the great power of Facebook that allowed it to become an instrument of protest, as in Egypt, but also as an instrument of business and, beyond that, a natural way of having contact with friends.
Saverin has had little to do with Facebook in recent years. But he re-entered public consciousness recently when, days before Facebook's actions were going to hit Wall Street, he renounced his American citizenship in favor of Singapore, where he has lived since 2009.
Many saw it as an evasion, a way to avoid paying U.S. taxes on their share of the company, valued somewhere around $2 billion. He says that is not the case and noted that, as reported, he is paying his taxes.
The decision was based strictly on my interest in living and working in Singapore, he said. I am bound and will pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes to the U.S. government. I already paid and will continue to pay the taxes that I owe based on my time as an American citizen.
Saverin's father, Roberto, echoed those thoughts in the article.
It was difficult for me, because of the life I was building in the United States, to hear from Eduardo that he had to give up his citizenship, he said. But he did it not because he wanted to, but because he had no other option as a foreigner who lived in Singapore, where financial transactions are more restricted and bureaucratic for those who have an American passport. There was no other way.
Roberto and his family emigrated to the United States of Brazil in the midst of political turmoil, and Saverin's registered birthplace is Miami.
Saverin continues to work as an investor and partner in Internet startups from his apartment in Singapore, where an office contains three 27-inch Mac monitors in which he constantly monitors everything, from stock prices to weather, writes Altman.
As for Facebook itself? Saverin still has his own profile, with over 1 million people subscribed to it. But he uses it almost exclusively for news about his new startups, keeping personal details to himself.
I don't like to show my private life online, he said.

"He won six medals at the Winter Olympics, including a gold in 2008, and a bronze a few months ago in Sochi. However, Bode Miller's methods have never been orthodox.
I've never worked very goal-oriented, admit. I think I've had some good results and I've had a long run, so, I mean, I'm happy about that. But I never had goals, like most people.
Miller has always intrigued the media and fans alike. Unconventional breeding in a New Hampshire log cabin without electricity or running water gave way to a ski race in which, for Miller, his natural talent and love of sport always won, well, winning.
In fact, his goal, as indicated in his book Bode: Go fast, Be good, Have fun was skiing as fast as the natural universe would allow.
Back home after emotional Olympics in Sochi, where Miller wept during a live interview with NBC's Christin Cooper when asked about his brother's recent death, Miller is focusing on another project: his Turtle Ridge Foundation.
Miller began the foundation after his close friend Cameron Shaw-Doran suffered a traumatic injury that left him paralyzed from the chest down.
I was trying to help him get back involved in sports. He was a great athlete before his injury and he was really having a kind of difficult adaptation, which is a very difficult process when you are hurt that way, Miller says. Just to watch it happen that I saw how difficult it was and how little support there was for him.
The experience motivated Miller to find ways to help get disabled and injured athletes more involved in sports. We offer the sports equipment for them and the environment that allows them to participate in whatever sport it is, Miller explains.
Shaw-Doran serves as team development director for Turtle Ridge, and Miller has called on friends and partners from around the sports world to create and adapt teams to help adaptive skiers and adaptive athletes in other sports.
An important annual event for Turtle Ridge is Bodefest, an extravagance of skiing and barbecue all day in Miller's territory in Cannon Mountain, New Hampshire, complete with autographs, an auction and an opportunity for children to run their idol.
Watching Miller fall down the mountain, swarming by an accelerated army of little Bodefilos, it's a wonder and a testament to his abilities that the whole thing doesn't end up in a giant human snowball.
All the kids want to try to get on the elevator with me at least one race and there are 400 kids about. It becomes a bit of pandemonium on the way down, Miller says.
Bodefest is not only a fundraiser, but it is also an opportunity for adaptive athletes to try out some of the new teams in the snow at the end of the season.
The program changed my life, says adaptive skier Owen Anketell, who has a condition that affects the muscles of his legs. I never thought I'd be able to ski even though I'm in a wheelchair -- or bicycle -- but this program has really changed my mind about adaptive sports.
The key is to empower, Miller says. When we build part of our ski team and you give it to a kid who never had the chance to climb up and experience what it's like to ski on a giant mountain and see how it can change their lives, I think it's really... it's pretty amazing.
The feeling seems to fit Miller's overall philosophy of focusing on how sport makes you feel, instead of the final game, a feeling that you think everyone is entitled, regardless of their ability.
It may not be competition, but it's a goal you can take in retirement -- and still win.

"When Lukas Hartmann, 29, enrolled in the genetic testing service of 23 and Me at home, there were no surprises in his results.
The Berliner learned that he would probably die of a mixture of heart attack and prostate cancer, he wrote on a friend's blog, but nothing special there.
Then, a few months ago, he received an update from the company.
Hartmann's genetic code showed two mutations that are related to the muscular dystrophy of the extremities, says the site told him. Some people with muscular dystrophy of the extremities-girl lose the ability to walk and suffer from severe disability, their results page read.
This cannot be true, he thought. Must be a mistake.
Genetic testing can be a powerful tool. You can provide information about your family history, tell you how your body could respond to different medications, and identify your risk factors for disease.
It can also be misleading.
On Monday, the Food and Drug Administration ordered 23andMe to stop sales of its $99 home genetic testing kits, saying the Google-backed company has not proven the validity of its product.
The FDA warned that clients who received inaccurate results could suffer from undue mental distress or undergo unnecessary medical procedures. The government agency has asked 23yMe to review its marketing strategy to comply with federal regulations.
The action provoked outrage among some of the supporters of 23 and Me.
So GMOs, aspartame, artificial flavors and colors, pink drool... no problem! a poster called Laura Ann wrote on the company's Facebook page. But in no way should we be allowed the right to know our own genetic material as a means of making better decisions about our health.
In a statement, 23andMe said that he has received the letter from the FDA and will work to address the concerns of the agency.
There are over 3 billion letters in our genetic code. Although it's been 10 years since the Human Genome Project was completed, scientists still don't understand what each gene does, and what a mutation could mean to someone's health.
It is one of the most often encountered problems by opponents of home genetic testing kits. If DNA experts do not understand 100% of what a genetic mutation means, how can we expect consumers to do so?
5 great things DNA tests can do
Scientists have identified more than 2,000 individual genetic disorders, says Rebecca Nagy, president of the National Society of Genetic Counselors. These are disorders that can be diagnosed based on the mutation of a single gene in the body; some examples include Huntington's disease or cystic fibrosis.
But conditions like type 2 diabetes or Alzheimer's are more complex. Hundreds of genes can contribute to the development of these diseases, Nagy says, and a person's risk is also influenced by their environment. The test of risk markers scattered in someone's genome is really just the test of the tip of the iceberg.
That's where it's a little scary, because if a person has a normal 23andMe result, they're thinking they don't have a risk, he says. It's not that the science behind -LRB- this kind of genetic testing -RRB- isn't good. The science behind them is not complete.
The advantage of these genetic testing kits at home -- and 23andMe is not the only company that sells them -- is that they have generated a lot of buzz about genetics, Nagy says. He says he believes that most of the first adopters of the tests are knowledgeable of the information and understand that the results are not in stone.
I don't think anyone thinks this kit replaces formal tests by a doctor, Heather Armstrong posted on the 23andMe Facebook page. I seriously doubt that a doctor will agree to perform, say, a double mastectomy, based on these results.
Joseph Stolarski posted, “If you find something interesting, then take it to a medical professional for an additional evaluation. No one is or should trust him for medical diagnosis.It's just a tool, like personally checking his heart rate with a clock or checking his weight on a scale.
But Nagy says she's worried about what will happen when the tests become more conventional.
Giving this kind of information to someone who doesn't know the limitations of genetic testing could be dangerous.
Nagy recommends that anyone who wants to do genetic testing first talk to a genetic counselor. Counselors have specialized postgraduate degrees and extensive knowledge of the human genome. They are also trained to explain the test results to laymen.
Our message is to be an intelligent consumer, says Nagy. Know what you're doing so that when you get the results back you can really use them for your best benefit.
Hartmann did an intense investigation, saying he looked at the raw data 23 and provided me with it. Eventually he found that he had two mutations, he says, but they weren't in the same gene. He says he filed his error report with the company and apologized.
In general, Hartmann believes that it is good for every person to have affordable access to their genetic data. But he's been looking at the community forums of 23 and Me. and has seen how seriously some people take their results, without fully understanding them.
Hartmann says he now believes he won't get muscular dystrophy in his limbs, although he says there's a risk that he can pass the genetic mutations on to his children.
I can live with that, he wrote. For quite some time, I hope.

"In today's world, it's not unusual for people to get on a plane, and be halfway around the world in a matter of hours. Jumbo jets used today are common in most developed countries, but there was a time, not long ago, before air travel was even possible. That was before Orville, and Wilbur Wright built and flew his first plane in the early 20th century.

On December 17, 1903, the brothers made their historic flight to Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, officially inaugurating a new era in travel. His contributions to the new aeronautics science continued for at least 10 years after that historic day. What separated the Wright brothers from other aviation pioneers was that the brothers developed an effective mechanism to control their plane. Its three-axis control system is still in use today, more than 100 years after its development.
The first flight wasn't very long. It was only 120 feet long, 10 feet high, and only 12 seconds long, but it was flight. Orville flew the plane, while Wilbur was running next door. There were only five eyewitnesses to the flight, but one photographer captured the image in a movie, and the rest was aviation history.
The brothers were very protective of their new invention, and it made it difficult for reporters to chronicle their efforts. This led to widespread rumors that the whole thing was a hoax. Over the next few years, the brothers worked to secretly refine their flying machine, leading to further doubts. However, in 1908, the brothers took their invention to Le Mans, France, to set up an exhibition. Wilbur guided his plane by making turns and other maneuvers, which surprised the crowd. Soon, the Wright brothers were famous. They changed the way people travel.",B2
"The New York Opera needs $7 million in fund-raising by Monday or it could be closing its curtains forever.
In addition to that money, the opera company wants to raise an additional $13 million by the end of 2013 towards future seasons, according to a press release.
If we don't raise the -LRB- $7 million -RRB- by the end of Monday, the board will begin the bankruptcy process, spokeswoman Risa Heller told CNN on Friday.
The company started a campaign to raise $1 million of that $7 million through an online fundraising site -- Kickstarter.com -- that will end on September 30. As of Friday the online campaign had raised only $202,223 donated from over a thousand supporters.
The organization raised $1.5 million outside the Kickstarter campaign, according to Heller.
The odds have been against us for a long time, George Steel, CEO and artistic director of the company, said in an online video, but in the face of that difficulty we have made great progress.
The company, called The People's Opera by the former mayor of New York Fiorello LaGuardia, was founded on the principle that every New Yorker should be able to afford to go to the opera, Steel said.
Steel explains that for the company to break balance, it would have to sell each ticket for $600, but instead the initial ticket price is actually $25 to make it more affordable.
The New York Opera received critical praise in the past for its world premieres of works, including Robert Ward's The Crucible and Anthony Davis The Life and Times of Malcolm X.
The company opened its current season on September 17 with opera Anna Nicole, and in case of not raising the necessary funds by Monday, it could be the company's latest production.
We need the help of the people we were founded to serve in our season this year, Steel said, talking to New York residents and opera fans everywhere. We need them to come together and move forward. I hope we can count on you.
This year marks the 70th anniversary of the New York Opera House, which opened in 1943, becoming New York's second opera house. The Metropolitan Opera was founded more than 60 years ago, in 1880.

"David Goldman says he doesn't understand why he can't have custody of his son after his ex-wife's death in Brazil. The U.S. government agrees.
David Goldman is fighting for custody of his son after Bruna Bianchi Goldman died during another delivery.
Goldman told CNN's Larry King that he had no idea when he left his wife and 4-year-old son at Newark International Airport in 2004 for a two-week vacation to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, that he was about to get tangled up in an international custody battle.
Shortly after Bruna Bianchi Goldman arrived in her homeland, she called to say she wanted the divorce, which she obtained in Brazil, and would stay there with her son, Sean.
The battle for custody has taken many twists and turns and gained the attention of the State Department and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
A child belongs to his family, and there is no reason why David Goldman should not get his son back, Clinton said in a recent interview on the NBC's Today program. And we hope that will be resolved very soon. Obviously, if not, we will continue to discuss it with the Brazilian government.
For almost five years, Goldman has struggled to regain custody of his son. It is a case that has been complicated by Bianchi Goldman marrying again, becoming pregnant and dying during labor last summer. Sean Goldman is said to live with his stepfather, who has been granted interim guardianship.
I went down... to bring my son home, Goldman said in CNN's Larry King Live on Wednesday, thinking that his ex-wife's death had made the custody issue questionable, and we discovered that this man did not file custody, but filed to remove my name from a Brazilian birth certificate that had been issued for my son, who was born in Red Bank, New Jersey.
Goldman continues to press his case through the U.S. government.
The State Department is working diligently to ensure that David and Sean Goldman enjoy their rights under the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Rights Aspects of International Child Abduction, the agency said in a statement. We will continue to insist that the Brazilian government comply with its obligations under the treaty and international law.
The Convention, of which Brazil is a signatory, is a multilateral treaty aimed at protecting children from the harmful effects of abduction and retention across international borders through a procedure for their prompt return, according to the Hague Convention web site.
Brazilian courts have refused to return Sean Goldman to the United States for any custody hearings the New Jersey courts have ordered and the Brazilian government has not intervened. As a result, the case remains a deadlock.
I'd say he's been very brave, as he's struggled to get his son back, Clinton said in the NBC interview. His son is the most precious person in the world for him and has gone not only the extra mile, but mile after mile, round and round, trying to make it clear that his son Sean deserves to be returned to him.
But in Larry King Live, Helvecio Ribeiro, a spokesman for the Bianchi family, questioned Goldman's ability as a father.
I don't question biological law, he said. The fact is, to be a father, you have to be more than a DNA donor, Mr. King. Paternity is not about making home movies and taking pictures, it's about sacrifice. It's about providing support to your child. It's about being there even when you're not there.
“And Mr. Goldman, while Bruna was still alive, did not,” Ribeiro said.
Goldman visited his son for the first time in more than four years last month, a bittersweet experience that was heartbreaking when the time came to return to the United States.
He asked me why I haven't come to see him all this time, Goldman told Larry King, and that was very, very painful -- and the anguish on his face when he asked me that question. I didn't want to tell you that... you're holding him.
International custody struggles are common and were supposed to be simplified with the 1980 Hague agreement, but conflicting judicial systems and conflicting relations may prevail over international law. The next step in this case is uncertain.

"Junior Smart knows a lot about gangs. She is now 36 years old and her life can be divided into two distinct phases. He tells how in his adolescence, after his mother's death, he became a southern London gang, which, at that time, helped fill a huge void.
“They became my new support group,” he says. “At first it was just a little fun, but then it became more serious, more and more about making money. They got involved in crime. That’s how it was.” At Smart School he failed his GCSE, then returned to college and passed the lot. He secured a full-time job in the administration and worked as a DJ. But on the other hand, he was making money illegally as part of the gang.
He was finally arrested for serious drug-related crimes and sent to prison for 12 years. Immediately, he says, his sense of invincibility broke. “The first night after I was arrested was the biggest wake-up call of my life,” he says. “I had been living a dual life. I had been living as a person for my companions and another person for the enemies of my companions. I spent a lot of time solving myself.
Today, Junior Smart leads a team of 12 full-time workers and six volunteers, which aims to drive young criminals and gang members away from crime. Most of those who work there are, like Smart himself, ex-criminals. A few continue to serve their sentences, but are considered sufficiently reformed to be allowed to leave during the day to help. They work with the police, the probation service and other voluntary organizations to help those who feel trapped and frightened in the violent criminal gangs operating throughout London.
For Smart, the extraordinary trip from gang member to mentor began when he witnessed, from within, a prison system that was obviously failing its inmates. He reminds a drug addict who became friends that, to his dismay, he kept coming back. “I was moved by the people who kept coming back,” he says. “I couldn’t believe that nothing was being done about it. I was talking to the inmates and they knew what needed to be changed in their lives, but the problem is that the prison system only deals with the crime of the 'index'.”
“One guy had a cocaine habit of £300 a week, which he financed through theft. He told me things about how he'd get into a house, even when he knew there were people there. So even though he had a drug addiction, he never dealt with it. What convinced me of that is that it is simply a revolving door.”
That case and many others persuaded Smart to start working as a “listener” of the prison, a prisoner who helps reassure newcomers and speaks to them during their early days inside. From there he developed what he calls his own “little plan” to execute his own plan once out of prison, using the experience of former criminals to help others reject the revolving door of prison life. He was released early, after five years. “At the end of my sentence I had the opportunity to put my little model into practice,” he says.
So, what do you think now? Do you think that, after last August's riots and the government's promise to suppress gangs, things are getting better? He is careful to offer some praise to the police and says that much of his work in transporting gang members has been good. But in general it is highly critical with a disarticulated government approach that believes that once a gang leader is arrested, the problem is solved. He agrees with the conclusions of a report that arresting gang leaders can make things worse. He says the effect of removing the leader is often to destabilize the entire gang.
Draw a diagram of the hierarchy on a pad. “When you arrest the boss, people start fighting for the position up to the top. Who was the most loyal? Who had more respect? It's kind of like a family. They are more likely to act, through violence. It means that the arrest of gang leaders has been overturned because it has not had a long-term effect. They haven’t even given the community a break.”
Can you make the streets more dangerous? “You can do this, because in a vacuum the recruitment and manipulation of young people becomes even more frequent, creating new lower levels until the end... People take sides. If a band or other territorial street network knows that an old [leader] has been eliminated, then suddenly they think that band is weak... And that's why we have disputes between states. And what happens when that old man is in prison? He forms alliances with other gang members, or when he is released he tries to regain control. That’s when violence occurs.”
In order to spread the risk to lower levels, he said that gangs were recruiting much more in primary schools. The younger members are called “tinies”. “In recent years we have seen more and more of this. Small children can be as young as eight to eleven years of age.” Young people are brought in to protect their seniors from risk. It is often they who are accused of doing street treatment or even stabbing, he says.
Smart says that, with the lack of government funding and commitment to long-term rehabilitation, the challenges are immense, particularly in the current economic climate. “I try to involve a young man who has been earning £300 a week by illegal methods. Before, it was hard to try to convince him. But with high unemployment and cuts in profits, it makes things more difficult.”
Having said that, your project, which has more than 1,000 clients, is yielding results. Less than 20% of those who come for help repeat. From personal experience, Smart refuses to dismiss a single individual as beyond redemption and that is what drives him. “I don’t think that about anyone,” he says.

"Johnny Depp is an American movie star known for taking eccentric roles that many Hollywood stars would not do. He has won two awards for best actor, including the Golden Globe Award and the Screen Actor's Guild Award. Depp has played some of the most lovable characters in the history of American modern cinema, making him one of the most popular actors in the United States today.

Depp was born in Kentucky, but grew up in Florida. He left school at the age of 15 to pursue a career as a Rock 'n' Roll musician. He obtained very little success as a musician, and was introduced to the performance by his former wife while visiting Los Angeles.
After debuting at A Nightmare on Elm Street, Depp had his first break when he was elected to the popular 21st Jump Street television show. The show lasted several years, and Depp began to be noticed by Hollywood producers. His first major success was playing an artificial character in the film Edward Scissorhands. This role was the first of many rare characters played by Depp. Edward Scissorhands was critically acclaimed, and won several industry awards.
Depp continued his success at Edward Scissorhands with a series of strong roles. In 1999, he played Ichabod Crane in the film Sleepy Hollow. His performance was well received by critics and the public alike. His most successful role was to play Captain Jack Sparrow in The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, another eccentric character. This role was described as a difficult role that only someone like Depp could achieve.
In 2005, Depp starred Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, playing once again a very eccentric character who lived in a chocolate factory.",B2
"There may not be more artist in the history of music in the United States than the late Michael Jackson. Jackson's list of colleagues in the industry is very short, to say the least. Jackson began his career in the early 1970s as the youngest member of the musical group The Jackson 5. Michael was the lead singer, and possibly the most talented of the five brothers who formed the band. He was born on August 29, 1958 as the eighth 10-year-old son in an African-American family in Gary Indiana. The driving force behind the group's success was his father, Joseph ""Joe"" Jackson. The group was very popular at the time, but young Michael was leaving in his own career shortly after. He was a successful singer, composer, actor, dancer and entrepreneur, but his career was not without controversy.

His album Thriller is the best-selling album of all time. It was released in 1982, and was followed by a series of successful albums, films, music videos and business. In 1993 the first of several people came forward to accuse Jackson of inappropriate sexual behavior in a child. This and other accusations would haunt Jackson throughout his adult life. Jackson also gained a reputation for strange behavior. One of the indelible images often associated with Jackson is when he held his newborn child on a balcony of the hotel to show it to his audience.
It was rumored that Jackson bought the bones of the famous Elephant Man, slept in an oxygen store, and altered his appearance to look white. His childhood photographs and as a young adult show a very different Jackson. She married twice in her life, including a brief marriage to Lisa Marie Presley, the daughter of the equally great musician, Elvis Presley.
Jackson died on June 25, 2009, and even his death was not without controversy. His family filed an unfair death suit against his doctor, who was later found guilty.",B2
"Mexico City sees its share of protests, but this was unusual.
A woman cried. Other protesters shouted at the top of their lungs, demanding answers. Others showed photos of their relatives to bewildered passersby.
Protesters who met Thursday are relatives of 11 partyers who disappeared more than a week ago from a bar in an elegant neighborhood of Mexico City known as Zona Rosa, or Zona Rosa. The area has a vibrant night scene with bars, nightclubs and luxury restaurants on all streets.
Protesters say their relatives were kidnapped on May 26 when they were partying in Heaven, a bar after hours in the neighborhood. The 11 o'clock disappeared between 10 a.m. and noon, they say.
The bar is a few steps from Paseo de la Reforma, an iconic avenue in the center of Mexico City. The emblematic monument of the Angel of Independence is nearby, as is the United States Embassy and the financial district.
Guadalupe Dominguez, a relative of one of the disappeared, said that a witness told him that the 11 people were abducted by armed men who appeared in vans, but authorities say there is no evidence of that incident.
“A young man who managed to escape was the one who told us, but we really don’t know anything else,” Dominguez said.
Mexico reports more than 26,000 missing persons
Most of those who went out in the bar after hours were 20 years old, except Yersi Ortiz, who is 16. María Teresa Ramos, Ortiz's grandmother, said family members are bewildered and want answers.
This supposedly happened on Sunday in broad daylight. This could not have happened during the day and a few steps from Reforma Avenue without anyone noticing. “There should be surveillance cameras that can show us exactly what happened,” Ramos said.
Maria del Carmen Zamudio, another relative in the protest, said the witness told the young people that they were suddenly told to leave.
The owner-LRB-bar-RRB apparently told them there was going to be a police operation and turned off the lights. He told them to leave, and armed men in black trucks were already waiting for them outside, Zamudio said.
The police say there was no such operation. Mexico City Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera said authorities are treating the incident as a missing person case because so far, there is no evidence that the young people were kidnapped.
For now, we have not been able to confirm how this happened or the specific place where - LRB - these young people -RRB - were kidnapped. What we have is a missing persons report and the knowledge that they're missing. “We have to do something to find them,” Mancera said.
Inside San Pedro Sula, the murderous capital of the world
Prosecutor Rodolfo Rios Garza said the security cameras in the bar weren't working, but the authorities trusted the city's cameras in the neighborhood.
So far, he said, a video analysis of the cameras shows no violence in or around the bar where the kidnapping allegedly took place.
Authorities searched the bar and found illegal drugs, but there were no signs of forced entry or anything to indicate that the young people had been kidnapped, Rios Garza said.
More than 26,000 people have disappeared in Mexico in the last six years as violence escalated and the country’s government repressed drug cartels, according to the Mexican Ministry of the Interior. The authorities have no data on how many of the disappearances are related to organized crime.
The 26,121 disappearances occurred during the six years of government of former President Felipe Calderón, which ended on December 1 when Enrique Peña Nieto assumed the presidency.
The bar has been closed while the investigation of the disappearances continues. The Attorney General ' s Office of Mexico has also joined the investigation.
Last month, Malcolm Shabazz, grandson of civil rights activist Malcolm X, was beaten to death in another establishment in Mexico City.
Shabazz, 28, was found outside the bar by police at 3:30 a.m., one block south of Garibaldi Square.
Two waiters were arrested in connection with Shabazz's murder, the Attorney General's office said. Rios Garza said the men work at the bar, The Palace Club, where Shabazz and three people drank drinks. One argument came when the staff said the bill was $1,200. Shabazz was beaten while another man was threatened and stripped of his belongings, Rios said.

"After a weekend of intense investigation, authorities are gathering more details about Friday's fatal shooting at Los Angeles International Airport, including the suspect's behavior at the beginning of the week and a warning from his family that he may have arrived minutes too late.
Officers sent to check Paul Ciancia's welfare arrived at his apartment less than an hour after the shooting began, police said Monday.
Here is a summary to update you:
Suspect
Cianncia, 23, from Los Angeles, is accused of murdering a federal officer and committing violence at an international airport.
He was shot by officers on Friday and was in critical condition at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center on Sunday.
One source said Ciancia couldn't talk to the investigators.
Tracks on a Motivation
Attorney General Eric Holder said Monday that further investigation is needed to find out the motive for the attack.
But a note found in Ciance indicated that he wanted to kill employees of the Transportation Security Administration to instill fear into what the suspect called the agents' treacherous minds, said FBI Special Agent in charge David Bowdich.
According to someone who knew Ciancia and his three roommates well, Ciancia began asking for a trip to the airport days before the shooting. He said he needed to fly to New Jersey to help his sick father, but he never said what day he needed to leave, the source said.
On Friday, Ciancia broke into a roommate's room and demanded a trip to the airport immediately, the source said, who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity.
The forced roommate. Investigators don't think the roommate had any idea of Ciance's plans.
The almost-saved
At the same time, Ciancia was texting family members in Pennsville, New Jersey.
One suggested something bad would happen.
Although Ciancia has no known history of mental illness, she said in the texts that she was unhappy, and the messages were alarming enough for Ciancia's father to decide to call the police.
I felt it was pretty serious. It sounded like Paul Ciancia in California was thinking of hurting himself, so obviously he knew he needed to make a phone call to the LAPD, Pennsville Chief of Police Allen Cummings told Jake Tapper of CNN on Monday.
Cummings spoke to a lieutenant there, who told him the department was in the middle of responding to a shooting in LAX.
At this point, we weren't connecting the dots, he said. They did so later when a reporter called the police chief, asking him to comment on the shooting.
L.A.P.D. Station. Andy Smith says the police were called for the first time to check Ciance at 10:06 a.m. Officers arrived at his apartment six minutes later, according to Smith.
Ciance was already gone.
The timeline provided on Monday by the police differed from that offered earlier by representative Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House's National Security Committee. He said the police had arrived at Ciancia's apartment about 45 minutes after the suspect had gone to the airport.
According to the L.A.P.D. account, they arrived 52 minutes after the shooting, which began around 9:20 a.m., according to the police. It was not immediately clear when Ciancia left for the airport.
The attack
Around 9:20 a.m. on Friday, Ciancia approached a Transport Security Administration checkpoint at Terminal 3. He pulled a 223-caliber assault rifle out of a bag and shot TSA officer Gerardo Hernández at close range, according to a court document filed by an FBI agent.
Ciance then climbed a escalator but shot Hernández again, apparently after seeing him move.
He kept walking and shooting. Witnesses said he went from person to person, asking, ""Are you from the AST?""
I shook my head, traveler Leon Saryan told Anderson Cooper of CNN. And he moved on.
Chaos and terror inside LAX Terminal 3
Victims
Hernández, 39, was the first TSA officer to die in the line of duty since the agency was established in 2001.
He was proud of his duty to the American public and to the TSA mission, said his wife, Ana Hernández.
The couple, who married in 1998, have two children.
Two other AST officers, James Speer, 54, and Tony Grigsby, 36, were injured but released from the hospital.
Grigsby, who was shot in the foot, told reporters on Monday that he was injured while helping an old man move to a safe area.
I turned around and there was a gunman, he said. He shot me twice.
A traveler who was shot in the leg, Brian Ludmer, 29, from Lake Forest, Illinois, was in good condition on Sunday.
The Police Response
TSA officers are unarmed. So it was the airport cops who finally shot Ciancia several times in the chest, also hitting him on the face and neck.
The chief of police at the airport Patrick Gannon said the FBI told him his officers were 60 seconds behind Ciance. He commended his response, although acknowledging that he had removed his officers from positions within checkpoints last year.
The threat... at the airport does not exist behind security on that podium; the threat exists from the edge, Gannon said. So... we've got our people parked all over the airport.
Holder said Monday that the investigation will include a review of security measures at LAX and other airports.
The responsibility to protect airport security is not a function of the TSA, but something I think we need to examine, given what happened in Los Angeles, he said.
Delays in travel
The incident forced the authorities to close parts of the airport, evacuate the passengers and place a temporary hold on some departures and landings.
More than 167,050 air passengers were affected by the incident on Friday as a result of cancellations, delays or detours to other airports, according to LAX. An airline, JetBlue, temporarily moved its operations to Long Beach Airport.
On Saturday, another 40 flights were affected, including 30 that were cancelled, involving some 4,000 passengers, according to Los Angeles International Airport.
According to FlightAware, a flight tracking website, airlines cancelled 236 flights to or from LAX after the incident on Friday morning and 27 more on Saturday.
Another 919 flights were delayed during the two days, FlightAware said.
However, some of these cancellations and delays may have been caused by problems other than shooting.
The airport normally operated on Monday morning.
Suspect's family responds
The Ciance family, in a statement read Monday afternoon by attorney John Jordan in New Jersey, said they were shocked and numbed by last Friday's tragic events.
It is very important for us, as a family, to express our deep and sincere sympathy for the Hernández family, said the Ciance family. -LRB- By -RRB- all accounts, Officer Hernández was an exemplary member of the police community and a good family man. Our hearts are directed to his family and to many others who mourn his death.
We also wish to convey our hope that those who were injured during this incident will recover quickly and fully. We also regret the inconvenience experienced by thousands of travelers, as well as by the Los Angeles airport administration and employees.
The Ciance family said they would continue to love and care for Paul.
We will support him in the difficult times ahead. Although we do not want to minimize the pain and anguish experienced by many other families, we hope the public understands that this is a very difficult time for our family, too, the family said.
What's next?
If convicted, Ciancia could face the death penalty or life imprisonment without parole. The U.S. Attorney General I'd decide whether to pursue a death sentence.
TSA Administrator John Pistole said the shooting has led to a review of the security protocol with partner agencies.
McCaul said better coordination with local police could improve security at checkpoints.
But the congressman recognized that it's very difficult to stop these types of attacks.
It's almost like an open mall, he said.

"Hi, Linda.
How's it going?
I'm sorry I haven't been in touch for so long but I've had exams so I've been studying every minute off. Anyway, I'd love to hear all your news and hope we can get together soon to catch up. We move to a bigger flat so you can come visit us for a weekend?
How's the new job going?
I can't wait to hear from you!

Hello Helga,
I've wanted to write to you for years, so don't worry! How'd the exams go? When will you know your results? I'm sure you made it brilliant as always!
As for me, I'll have been at the new job for three months by the end of next week, so I feel better off. At first I felt like I had no idea what I was doing but now I realize it's normal to feel that way. There was a lot to learn – there is still really – and soon I had to get used to the idea that I can't know everything. I used to work late a lot and weekends, but I'm slowly getting into a normal routine.
Which means I'd love to come visit! We need a good meeting! I can't believe we haven't seen each other since Carl's wedding. How about next month?
Anyway, I'd better get back to work.
Congratulations on the new floor! I can't wait to see you!

"Kenya’s national football team may not have reached the World Cup final in Brazil, but a man will be there for his African nation.
In the role of Kenya's representative is Aden Marwa, the country's first lineman to officiate in the biggest event of the beautiful game.
Football is my life, football has made my life a big change, Marwa tells CNN.
Like many young people, Marwa became obsessed with football, often walking long distances to reach a TV set to watch a game. However, despite his passion for the game, he wanted nothing to do with arbitration and for a good reason.
These times it was difficult because a game would hardly end without a referee being beaten, he explains. Fans were noisy and you know, the facilities weren't very good.
You were playing in open fields so that the referee could be attacked at any time so that when I could see that as a child, I didn't love it. So I was scared.
By the time Marwa became a lineman in 1998 at the age of 21, however, the game had changed dramatically as more resources and education had been channeled into sport.
Once you decide you want to become a football referee there are three pillars. One is your physical state, two is your physical state and then three is your technical physical state, so you can't compromise.
In 2006, the ambitious referee got his big arbiter break in a game at the Kenya Premier League before making his international debut as an assistant referee for FIFA only two years later.
Today he has the recognition of the best arbiter assistant in the Premier League of Kenya and his talent has taken him to the sunny shores of South America for the 2014 World Cup, where he has been acting as an assistant reserve arbiter.
The 37-year-old knows that this will be the biggest test of his career so far and is prepared to have the eyes of millions of football fans reviewing each of his decisions.
Arbitrators have to make decisions in the shortest possible time. I see it once, but you, on TV, you'll see it and you'll see a repeat and you can even pause with the technology and even check it out, he says.
As an umpire I only have one angle to see him... so the challenge we have as referees, the biggest one, is how to place you in the right position and at the right time to make that crucial and very important decision.
Take a look at the video below to find out how Marwa prepared for her best time to date and earned her dream job by officiating in this year's World Cup.

"When Larry Pizzi, an executive veteran of the bicycle industry, first learned about electric bicycles nearly 20 years ago, he asked, “Why would anyone want to ruin a bicycle by putting a motor and batteries on it?”
It is a question that still intrigues the traditionalists. Bicycle shops have been slow to store electronic bicycles, although they have existed since the late 1990s. Sales in the United States have been modest.
Pizzi, who is now CEO of Currie Technologies, the number one seller of e-bikes in the United States, believes that this is about to change. Others in the industry agree. Family brands such as Trek, Raleigh and Specialized offer electric models and are betting on the market is about to take off.
“We’re at the height of ordinary adoption,” Pizzi said. “It seems that there are more players who enter the category with each passing month.”
USA is an atypical when it comes to electric bicycles. In 2014, nearly 32 million e-bikes were sold, the vast majority in China, where they are mainly used for transport. They are also popular in much of Europe. They are common in the Netherlands and Switzerland; German postal workers use them to move and BMW offers one for about $3,000.
Electric bicycles are different from motorcycles or mopeds, which depend on motorized power; they are bicycles that can be pedaled with – or without – assistance from an electric motor. Riding an electronic bike feels like riding a conventional bike with a fast tail wind; the engine helps you go faster or climb hills, but is usually not the main source of propulsion. Unlike mopeds, electronic bikes are generally allowed on bicycle lanes and can travel no more than 20 mph.
There is a debate about how many electric bicycles are sold in the US. And there's no official count.
Estimates of annual sales range from 50,000 to 175,000. That's comparable to the number of electric cars sold in the US. – 118,000 in 2014. However, although many people are aware of the Nissan Leaf, Chevy Volt and Tesla, few have heard of e-bike companies Currie, Pedego or ElectroBike.
To succeed, the electric bike business in the US it must remove legal, cultural and financial obstacles. Electronic bicycles are prohibited in some states, including New York, although the law does not strictly apply. The traditionalists they own and the bike shop staff do not like to put engines on bicycles, citing, among other things, the added weight. Some e-bikes are about 30 kg.
Electronic bicycles are also expensive. While low-end models sell for as little as $700, Court Rye, the founder and editor of ElectricBikeReview.com, a popular website, says drivers should expect to pay at least $1,500 for a quality electronic bike with a good battery. First-line models cost more than double.
Companies that manufacture and sell e-bikes say they can overcome these obstacles.
Electronic bicycle technology, particularly batteries, is improving. “The batteries are getting smaller, they’re getting lighter, they’re getting more reliable and they last longer,” says Don DiCostanza, founder and CEO of Pedego, an electric bicycle manufacturer and retailer.
Companies like Bosch, the German electronics giant, and Shimano, the leading manufacturer of bicycle gears, are entering the business, which should help erode the resilience of bike shops. “This has really caught the attention and imagination of bike dealers,” says Larry Pizzi of Currie. Pedego and ElectroBike startup are not waiting for the shops to arrive; they are building their own shops. Meanwhile, lobbying efforts are being made to allow the use of electronic bicycles everywhere.
Perhaps most importantly, as more cities build cycling infrastructure, including dedicated bike lanes, cycling has become more popular. As reported by the United States Census Bureau in 2014, the number of bicycle passengers increased from about 488,000 in 2000 to 786,000 in 2012. That is a “greater percentage increase than any other mode of displacement,” the report notes. Electric bicycles make travel more practical and fun by alleviating concern for hills, winds, fatigue and sweat.
Most of our customers are “aging baby boomers who want to rekindle the experience they had as a child,” says Don DiCostanza de Pedego. “The main reason they stopped riding a bike was through the hills.” Pedego has opened nearly 60 stores in the US. and has sold bicycles to tour companies in San Francisco and Washington, DC.
ElectroBike, which operates 30 stores in Mexico, opened its first American store in Venice Beach, California in the fall of 2014 and expects to grow to 25 U.S. stores in a year. CEO Craig Anderson says: “We want to help reduce traffic, help reduce our carbon footprint and promote a healthy lifestyle.”
Startups as Pedego and ElectroBike will have to compete with large companies such as Trek and Currie, which, in 2012, was acquired by the Accell Group, a public company based in the Netherlands that is the leader of the European e-bike market. Accell has the Raleigh brand, as well as Haibike, an award-winning German electric bicycle.
“Accell has high expectations about electronic bicycles in North America,” says Larry Pizzi of Currie. “Although baby boomers are still a very important segment, we are finding that many young people are using electronic bicycles for transportation, rather than cars.”
Accell's Yuba brand even sells a cargo bike with a stronger engine and rear rack. “You can have two children,” Pizzi says. “You can carry 45 kg of shopping. It’s a minivan alternative.”

"The balls have fallen down the parachute and the six numbers match, so it's time to buy that Audi, book your vacation in the US. and call the realtor. At least, that's what most lottery millionaires do, according to an analysis of spending and investment by the jackpot winners.
Since its launch in 1994, the lottery has created 3,000 millionaires who have earned more than 8.5 billion pounds in total, on average 2.8 million pounds each. The drip effect means that among them have created another 3,780 millionaires among their children, family and friends, according to the authors of the study, Oxford Economics.
Most of the winners (59%) quit work immediately, but 19% continue to do daily work and 31% do unpaid volunteer work. The good news for the economy is that 98% of the winners' spending remained in the UK. Through their spending on property, vehicles and vacations, it is estimated that each winner keeps six people on a full-time job for one year.
The winners have contributed nearly £750 million to gross domestic product (GDP), and have generated more than £500 million in fiscal revenue for the Treasury. Most of the money went to the property, with £2.72 billion spent on the main properties of the winners, and £170 million in the payment of existing debts and mortgages.
The maintenance of revenues was a priority, with £2,125 million spent on investments. Gifts to family and friends represented £1.17bn, and £680m were spent on cars and holidays.
The study, commissioned by Camelot, the operators of the UK National Lottery, to mark the milestone of 3,000 winners, was based on research of 100 £1m-plus winners. It was found that in total the 3,000 winners have bought 7,958 homes or flats in the UK, or 2.7 each, spending £3.3 billion. Most of the winners (82%) changed their main residence, spending an average of 900,000 pounds.
The new house is likely to come with a hot tub, with almost a third (29%) putting that on their shopping list. A walk-in dressing room was a necessity for 28%, almost a quarter (24%) opted for a property behind the electric doors, and 22% had a playroom, with 7% installing a billiard table.
Larger properties need maintenance, and 30% of winners employ a cleaner and 24% a gardener. A small proportion (5%) employed a beautician.
Audis were the favourite cars of 16% of the winners, with Range Rovers and BMWs also popular purchases (11% each), as well as Mercedes (10%) and Land Rovers (5%). The winners spent 463 million pounds on 17,190 cars, with the average price of their favorite 46,116.
Holidays were also a priority. Most (68%) choose five-star hotels abroad. The United States was the preferred destination of 27%, followed by the Caribbean (9%). Closer home, however, UK caravan sales have benefited. Over the past 18 years, 10% of millionaires have bought a caravan, generating sales worth approximately 7.4 million pounds.
Some winners (15%) have started their own businesses, 9% have helped others to do so, and 6% have invested or bought the businesses of others. Companies initiated or supported by lottery winners employ 3,195 people, according to the study.
Andy Logan, author of the report, said: “The effect of a victory extends far beyond what we expected. Not only does it transform the lives of friends and family, but every victory has a measurable effect on the UK economy, especially with so much of it spent in the UK. The use of each victory creates a wave effect throughout this generation and very often the next.”

"The Boston Bruins won their first Stanley Cup in 39 years, defeating the Vancouver Canucks 4-0 on Wednesday night in the seventh game and deciding on the annual National Hockey League championship.
The loss didn't go very well with hundreds of Canuck fans, who took to the streets and set fire to several overturned vehicles a few blocks from Rogers Arena, where the game was played.
Some fans stopped to pose in front of the flames. Others danced on top of another overturned vehicle. A boring cloud of gray smoke drowned some areas of the city centre.
iReport: Fires, riots and looting in Vancouver
The aerial images showed the Vancouver police wading against the undisciplined crowd who continually mocked and threw things at the officers. Members of the crowd jumped over a street fire, and officers fought several fans to the ground.
We can't release anything formal right now but the officers are busy dealing with some major groups of people determined to commit criminal acts such as pranks, vandalisms and fights, Vancouver Media Relations Officer Lindsey Houghton said in a statement.
We're working hard to get everyone home safely.
Freelance journalist Jorge Contreras told CNN that between 1,000 and 2,000 people were on the streets of downtown Vancouver, and that six police vehicles had been set on fire.
After dropping the first two games in Vancouver, the Bruins took four of the last five games of the Canucks, who fought to stay in Game Seven after dropping 1-0 in the first period.
The Bruins opened the game in the second, after rookie Brad Marchand got off on a bounce from Canuck goalkeeper Roberto Luongo to put away his second goal of the game.
We knew the second goal was going to be huge, Marchand, the 23-year-old rookie said in a post-game interview. It was nice to get that one, and we kept moving forward after that.
Marchand would finish the game with two goals and one assist.
But the game was really decided by Thomas, who polished his spectacular playoffs performance with a closed Seven game to take Conn Smythe's coveted trophy. Tim Thomas, whose unorthodox goalkeeper bewildered the Canucks all night long, set the NHL record for most of the shots faced and most of the savings in the history of playoffs.
He also broke Johnny Bower's 1960 record for most of the saves in a Stanley Cup final.
As he entered the series, Vancouver was considered the top team in special teams, especially in power moves. But that wasn't the case at this year's Stanley Cup, as Boston put five power-playing goals to the two of Vancouver. Vancouver also surpassed 10-0 in the second period.
Finally we brought our home game on the road, Zdeno Chara told Team Radio Canada. We play physics and take care of the disk, play extremely hard and pay attention to the details.
Patrice Bergeron's first goal should have been enough for fans to know the result of the game, as the team that scored the first goal won each game in this series.
The Bruins have now won the Stanley Cup six times, fourth among all NHL franchises, but they had not captured the sport's most coveted prize since 1972. They had been in the final five times since the last time they won, but this time it marked their first appearance since 1990.
The Canucks have been in the final three times in their 40 league seasons, but they have never won. Keeping the home-ice lead, they won the first two games in the series, but lost the three games played in Boston before losing home on Wednesday.
They were looking to become the first Canadian team to win the NHL title since the Montreal Canadians in 1993.

"He is on that landing pattern that middle-aged hearts finally arrive at: time for home and family and a woman who is worthy to maintain her love.
The winner of more than 50 Oscar, producer and political activist George Clooney is apparently committed to getting married. He's at a particularly crucial age. Forget that the 50 are the new 40, the 50 are very specific. Even younger people will begin to think about the meaning of life as the years no longer extend into a fantasy of infinity. Those years between 50 and 60 seem to be a particularly moving age for men, especially the kind of man who has trouble giving up motorcycles.
At some point in this period, emotion seekers and lust lovers receive their smell of mortality - LRB- perhaps because of their latest motorcycle accident -RRB- and become love with a new sense of gravity. With a wink at the motivation most mortals have, they are ready for an emotional legacy. -LRB- Tip: Children's watch -RRB-
It could irritate Clooney to be seen as so predictable. He's a gifted, idiosyncratic, irreverent guy. But he has been practicing for this transition of life in plain sight. In his films, he has played missing middle-aged men, lost in their careers, lost in careless marriages, lost due to lack of connection to something important -- Up in the air, The Descendents, Michael Clayton, among others. Many of these men reorganize their lives, readjust their principles, or at least find some knowledge of their own that was lacking.
What we know about Amal Alamuddin
If your commitment reports are true, this is kind of what Clooney has done, and what a bunch of professional single men ultimately come to do, especially about love. His apparent fiancée, Amal Alamuddin, is an accomplished lawyer full of words. Clooney's making that middle-aged love choice. He's choosing a woman of substance as well as beauty -- the kind of woman you'd want as a friend and counselor, the kind of woman that would have the genes to be the mother of your children -- and it's now, because suddenly you realize you don't have time to waste.
In this scenario of the punished Major Lotario, the candidate is young enough to covet and intelligent to impregnate himself. It's not like women, especially stars, don't get to the same point as Clooney and end up in the same position. But biology forces them to make the comparable choice at least a decade earlier. Unlike a woman his age, Clooney can play the whole game of calming down at almost any age. But he probably understood that some ages are better at this than others.
I know this isn't very romantic, but the time is... whether the 50-something group knows or not... guided by the Grim Reaper. If that sounds bad, it's not.
The middle age is an important moment for the reassessment and correction of the course. No matter how bright your star is, you know there's only a lot of time left to have a deep relationship and, maybe, a family. This is the true anchor of middle-aged love: It's time to stop fooling around.

"Yao Ming is one of the most influential people in the United States of America. So how does a 22-year-old Chinese man, born in Shanghai, become an international superstar, changing the way both cultures look at each other? Ming is at 7'6"", which makes him one of the highest players in history to play the game, but that is not the extent of his power. Ming was tall and talented.

Ming began his career in China, where he played for the Shanghai Sharks of the Chinese Basketball Association. That was the season when the Sharks won a CBA championship. He was able to negotiate a release of his contract with the Sharks, which made him eligible for the draft of the National Basketball Association in 2002. Ming was one of the most wanted players in China, and was eventually recruited by the Houston Rockets.
Ming found moderate success in the NBA. His size and strength made him a formidable presence. He was so big and talented that he could dominate any game just because he was on the court. Ming led the Rockets to the team's first playoffs appearance in several years, but their statistical totals weren't that impressive. However, Ming was one of the most popular players in the history of the NBA. Fans loved him, and they voted him on the All-Star eight times.
Ming created some degree of resentment from other players, especially Shaquille O'Neal from Los Angeles Lakers. O'Neal was one of the most dominant players in the game for a short number of years, and in 2003, Ming surpassed O'Neal in an NBA fan vote by more than 250,000 votes. This angered O'Neal, who promised to beat Ming every time the two giants met on the court.",B2
"The United States of America is the only country to land a manned spacecraft on the surface of the moon. The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Armstrong set foot on the surface of the moon on July 20, 1969, in what was one of the most viewed broadcasts in the history of the country. Armstrong became an instant celebrity, whose name became a domestic word for generations to come.

The lunar landing mission was carried out on the Apollo 11 spacecraft. Armstrong was the mission commander for the historic flight, and it was the second and last mission he carried out. There were complications in the landing module Armstrong treated at the time of landing. The module was arriving faster than planned. He was destined to miss the landing site several miles away, but some quick thoughts from Armstrong prevented a potential disaster.
When Armstrong went up to the lunar surface, his words resounded throughout the country and the world: ""That is a small step for man, a giant leap for humanity."" Years later, Armstrong and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) insisted that the appointment was incorrect and obscured by interference. However, the quote is remembered forever in its original form.
Armstrong received the Congressional Freedom Medal from President Richard Nixon, and was later awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor by President Jimmy Carter. The program was interrupted in the early 1970s. Other countries have landed unmanned missions to the largest satellite on Earth, but to date, no other person has walked on the moon since then. Neil Armstrong, a real American hero, died in 2012 complicating a surgical procedure.",B2
"Investigators expanded their search in Texas on Monday for a 7-year-old girl who was reported missing after her mother was found dead in Oklahoma on Sunday night.
Authorities are also trying to find the husband away from the dead woman, Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation said in a statement.
The girl -- Aja Daniell Johnson -- was reported missing from Geronimo, Oklahoma, late Sunday, the office said.
His mother, Tonya Hobbs, 37, was found dead in a caravan parked on Sunday night, the office said. Hobbs and his daughter were visiting Hobbsestranged husband, Lester William Hobbs, at his sister's house, said the office.
Lester Hobbs, 46, and Aja are missing and supposed to be in Hobbscar, researchers said they issued an amber alert to try to find her. Lester Hobbs is not Aja's biological father, police said.
Texas authorities also issued an amber alert, said Lisa Block, spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Security. Authorities believe Hobbs has connections to Rockport, Texas, and the alert was issued preemptively, he said.
Tonya Hobbs and her daughter were last seen on Saturday night. Authorities didn't say how Hobbs died, but the office said investigators believe someone killed her.
The motorhome belonged to Lester Hobbs, and was parked in his family home, Richard Goss, an agent in charge of the state investigation office in Lawton, Oklahoma, office, told reporters on Monday. Hobbsrelatives became suspicious Sunday after they did not see Tanya Hobbs or Aja, and one of them opened the door and discovered Tanya Hobbsbody, he said. Lester Hobbs and Aja were gone, Goss said.
The Hobbs were separated, but apparently Tanya Hobbs was visiting Lester Hobbs in an attempt to reconcile, Goss said. The couple had been together for about five years.
A forensic doctor was doing an autopsy, the office said, and the police want to question Lester Hobbs about his death.
He and the girl are believed to travel in his car, a 1992 white Toyota Walk with the Oklahoma label number 577-BPW. The two-door car has no hub cap, and the passenger rear window is covered in plastic, the office said.
Comanche County, Oklahoma, the Sheriff's Office said Aja has a medical condition that requires medication.
Our main concern right now is to find the girl, Sheriff Kenny Stradley told reporters. We know she needs some medicine, and the authorities were checking clues about that, she said. He didn't specify Aja's medical condition.
Goss said Lester Hobbs has an extensive criminal history, but he hasn't worked it out. Sheriff's office said he had prior convictions for serious crimes.
Lester Hobbs had to appear in court in Lincoln County, Oklahoma, on a DUI charge, Goss said, and he did not show up, so an order has been issued for him.
Aja's biological father received emergency custody from her in November, according to Oklahoma County District Court documents obtained by KWTV from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In an audience, Tonya Hobbs -- identified as Tonya Dunkin in the documents -- and the girl's father, John Johnson, agreed that she would have overseen the visit with Aja and kept the girl away from Lester Hobbs, the documents said.
Aja is 4 feet tall and weighs 59 pounds, Goss said. She has brown eyes, and her hair is brown with the ends dyed black.
Lester Hobbs is about 6 feet-1 and 190 pounds, with hazelnut eyes and brown hair, according to Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation. The agency posted a photo of him and said he has a mustache but no longer has a knob.
Geronimo is about 12 miles south of Lawton, Oklahoma, in the south-central part of the state.

"In the Arctic of Canada, summers are marked by a bright light that bathes the treeless tundra for more than 20 hours a day. For some, it is a welcome change from the relentless darkness of winter. But, for the small but growing Muslim community of Iqaluit, Nunavut, life in the land of the midnight sun poses a real challenge during the month of Ramadan, during which Muslims usually fast from dawn to sunset.
“I have not fainted once,” said Abdul Karim, 29, one of the few in the city who has carefully timed his fast from Ramadan to the Arctic sun since he moved from Ottawa in 2011. This year, that means eating around 1:30am before the sun rises and breaking its fast around 11pm when the sun sets. “The only reason to stop would be if my health was damaged,” Karim said. Pointing out his considerable frame, he laughed as he added: “But, looking at my condition, I don’t think fasting will hurt me.”
As the end of Ramadan approaches for Muslims around the world, much of the holy month's focus on community work, prayer and reflection has been a constant in communities around the world. But in Iqaluit and the other Muslim communities in the Arctic, the long days have forced a change in how the element of fasting is approached.
Most in Iqaluit adhere to the schedule followed by Muslims in Ottawa, about 1,300 miles south of the city – following the advice of Muslim scholars who have said that Muslims in the far north should observe Ramadan using the schedule of Mecca or the nearest Muslim city. It still means fasting about 18 hours a day, said Atif Jilani, who moved to Iqaluit from Toronto in 2015. “They are long days, but more manageable.”
Many of the 100 inhabitants of the community break their fast together, meeting in the new mosque of the city, finished in February in the middle of temperatures that went down to -50C with the cold wind- for evening dinners. As they get into traditional foods like dates and currys of goat or lamb, the sun shines through the windows.
It is a scene that takes place in Canada's northernmost mosques during Ramadan, while Muslim communities struggle with the unique geography of the country. The approximately 300 Muslims in Yellowknife, in the Northwest Territories, have several options when it comes to fasting during Ramadan, said Nazim Awan, president of the Yellowknife Islamic Center, with exceptions for those who are pregnant or ill. “There may be some superhumans who want to fast for 23 hours, but the other option is to follow the intention and spirit of fasting by following nearby cities or they can follow the times of Mecca and Medina.” In recent years, much of the community has chosen to follow the Ramadan calendar of Edmonton in Alberta. Some, such as Awan, the father of two young children, including a 12-year-old boy who recently began fasting, follow the times of Mecca. He hopes to encourage his son with the most manageable schedule of about 15 hours of fasting compared to about 18 hours in Edmonton.
“If I shake the times of Yellowknife or Edmonton, my son could say, ‘Dad, you’re really crazy. What are you doing? ',” he said. In the face of the inability to follow local sun movements, the approximately 100 Muslims of Inuvik, a small town 125 miles north of the Arctic Circle, have also been following the Edmonton calendar. “We currently have 24 hours a day of sunshine,” said Ahmad Alkhalaf. “There is no sunrise or sunset.”
Adherence to the Edmonton agenda was already underway in 2001 when it moved from Toronto to the small northern community of 3,500 people. “My first Ramadan here was in December. There is no sun at that moment; it is dark all day and night. So we use Edmonton time.” “Sometimes it can be psychologically difficult to follow the clock instead of what is happening outside,” Alkhalaf said. “You are supposed to break your fast when it’s dark and we eat when the sun is out. It is not usual to have iftar [the food that breaks the fast] when the sun rises,” he said. In Inuvik, where much of the population is Inuit, the Muslim community has sought to strike a balance between Ramadan and local culture and traditions. Iftar food includes dates and rich currys, as well as local hunting such as reindeer, prepared in accordance with Islamic law. “We make a soup or curry... but instead of using beef, we use reindeer.”
In Iqaluit, as the Muslim community prepares to mark the end of Ramadan, some reflect that the 2016 schedule, which extends over some of the longest days of the year, has made it one of the most challenging in recent years. It is particularly true for those like Karim who have resolutely followed the local sunrise and sunset. “But their efforts will be rewarded in years’ time,” Karim said, thanks to the lunar calendar. Ramadan will finally fall during the winter, which, in Iqaluit, sees the sunrise and sets in a few hours each day. “I’ll also follow those hours,” he said laughing. Oh, yeah, definitely.

"Berenstain Bears co-creator Jan Berenstain has died at the age of 88, according to a Facebook page dedicated to the hairy characters Berenstain and her husband created.
It is with a very sad heart that we inform you that our dear Jan died on Friday, February 24. We are grateful for all your very kind thoughts. Please remember your family at this very difficult time, said a statement on Berenstain Bears' Facebook page.
Berenstain and her husband, Stan, were already successful cartoonists when they decided to transition to writing children's books.
According to editor Harper Collins, The Big Honey Hunt, published in 1962, was the first book starring the bear family.
Since then, more than 330 Berenstain Bears books have been published in the last 50 years, the editor said.
More than 260 million copies have been sold, making it one of the best-selling series of children's books in history, Harper Collins said.
Berenstain Bears' stories were so popular that history became a special animated TV show on NBC in 1979 and then on a daily success TV series that began on PBS in 2002.
After Stan Berenstain died at 82 in 2005, Jan Berenstain and his son Mike continued writing and illustrating new adventures for Berenstain Bears, according to Berenstain Bear's Facebook page.
Berenstain lived in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, according to her editor.

"Poligamous sect leader Warren Steed Jeffs, who is awaiting trial in southern Utah, was charged with eight additional Arizona felony charges in two separate cases, authorities said on Thursday.
Polygamist Warren Jeffs faces eight additional charges related to alleged incest and sexual contact with a minor.
A grand jury charged Jeffs on May 10 with two counts of sexual conduct with a minor and two counts of incest for alleged incidents in 2002, according to a statement issued by Mohave County Attorney Matthew J. Smith.
On Thursday, another grand jury charged him with two additional sexual conduct charges with a minor and two additional incest charges. These crimes took place in Colorado City, Arizona, in 2003, according to the prosecution.
Both allegations claim that Jeffs, leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints - LRB- FLDS -RRB-, committed the crimes as an accomplice.
Under Arizona law, sexual conduct with a minor is a class 6 offence punishable by up to one year's imprisonment. Incest is a serious class 4 offence punishable by up to two and a half years ' imprisonment.
The cases involve two separate victims, Smith said in the statement. Mr. Jeffs will not come to Mohave County to face these charges or have an initial appearance in them until his Utah case is resolved.
Jeffs, 51, is awaiting trial in Washington County, Utah, accused of being an accomplice in rape by organizing the marriage of a 14-year-old girl to her 19-year-old cousin.
The trial began in April, but Fifth District Judge James Shumate postponed it to the beginning of this year, and no new date has been set. At that time, Shumate said the delay was due to recent information in the case, but did not explain.
The judge in March rejected a defense request to move the trial out of Washington County due to press coverage, but said he could reconsider whether lawyers encounter difficulties during jury selection.
Utah prosecutors say that because Jeffs forced the underage girl to marry, and therefore forced her to have sex with the adult man, and because Jeffs insisted that she stay married, he is an accomplice to rape.
During his preliminary hearing in December, Jeffsdefense lawyers said he never knew whether the marriage he had arranged had been completed and, if so, whether the sex was consensual.
The girl, identified only as Jane Doe, testified at the preliminary hearing that she was so scared during the forced wedding.
The whole time I was crying, he said. I wanted to die.
Rape as an accomplice is a first-degree crime in Utah, with a prison sentence of five years to life imprisonment.
Jeffs was previously charged in Arizona with two counts of sexual conduct with a minor for allegedly presiding over arranged marriages, along with an additional conspiracy charge.
Those charges, in 2005, were suspended while Jeffs was facing trial in Utah.
Jeffs was captured on August 28, 2006, at a traffic stop near Las Vegas, Nevada. By that time, I had been on the FBI's top 10 wanted list for months.
FLDS freely practices polygamy in the cities of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona, which extend along the state line. The sect maintains groups of followers in Texas, South Dakota, Nevada, British Columbia and Mexico.
The sect separated itself from the main Church of Jesus Christ from the Latter-day Saints, based in Salt Lake City, Utah, on the practice of polygamy.
The Mormon church, which renounced plural marriage more than a century ago, has no ties to Jeffsgroup. E-mail to a friend

"When it comes to deciding where the money goes, the Lotus Formula 1 team says that their top priority is the car, not the star driver sitting in the cab.
Kimi Raikkonen said last week that he decided to leave and return to Ferrari for the 2014 season because Lotus doesn't have my salary.
But the team, owned by the Luxembourg-based investment group Genii Capital, has now responded by explaining that it prefers to focus its finances on car development, even if this means seeing how its driving talent moves away.
Raikkonen has published Lotusonly's victory this year, with him and the team in fourth place in the respective classification of drivers and builders.
Our suppliers and key car developers were our priority -- perhaps not Kimi, Lotus team manager Eric Boullier, told the F1 official website.
Kimi was in a similar position last year and everything was settled by the end of the year. And Genii had a plan to do the same this year.
It's public knowledge for now that we're late to pay him, and he got angry.
To manage the cash flow -- and I don't mean the money itself or the budget we have, which is guaranteed by Genii, or at least most of it, since we don't have the revenue stream to allow us to live independently of Genii -- this cash flow is a problem if you have fixed costs and want to maintain the level of development.
You have to decide where you want to spend your money.
Genii Capital took full control of the team, which has run in F1 since 1981 under his former Toleman, Benetton and Renault costumes, from the former owner Renault in 2011.
The ownership of a private investment company, rather than car manufacturers such as Mercedes and Fiat, which owns Ferrari, or a global company such as Red Bull, can provide a more risky financial backdrop for an F1 team.
But Boullier says that the Lotusalternative business model does not mean that it is plunged into a financial crisis, as rumors circulating in sport would suggest.
Red Bull or Mercedes, those companies are sponsoring the teams, said Boullier, whose driver management company Gravity also has connections with Genii. Genii has a different strategy: they lend the money.
It is part of the strategy for partners to join the team and Genii will recover their investment.
Seventy-five percent of Lotus's debt comes from Genii. They could cancel it tomorrow by saying that this money is a sponsorship, and then our debt would be drastically reduced. Our normal debt is similar to that of most other teams.
Genii's strategy of choosing to fund the team before seeking sponsorship agreements to recover your investment is a bet.
Having world champion Raikkonen on board in 2007 would inevitably have helped attract sponsors, but now Boullier is looking for alternatives.
He says the team plans to emulate the business strategy of some rivals, including Red Bull and McLaren, looking for a sponsor of the title.
“It is no secret that for quite some time Genii has been looking for partners to make sure we can bring more money to the team and have access to a larger portfolio of sponsors,” the Frenchman added.
We must assure the sponsors, as this is the only way forward.
Formula One depends massively on people, and to attract the best people to a team you need to have money, so you can build something in the long run.
Genii's plan was to bring the team in five years -- what we're trying to do -- but to move on to the next step it takes another five-year plan instead. And that's what we're working on.

"One of the darkest days in American history was September 11, 2001. This is ""a day that will live in infamy"" for most Americans. It was the most tragic day in the country's history since December 7, 1941, when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. September 11 was the day when Muslim extremists hijacked four commercial planes in an attempt to destroy the American spirit by hitting those planes in four buildings. Three of the four aircraft reached their targets, while one was stopped by a group of everyday heroes who gave their lives for their country.

In the early hours of the morning of September 11, 2001, American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York. A few minutes later, flight 175, also an American Airlines flight, hit the south tower. Both suicide attacks knocked down the towers, but not immediately. It took time for the extreme heat of the burning jet fuel to weaken the towers until their eventual collapse. At the same time, American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon, which is a government building in the country's capital, Washington, D.C.
The fourth flight, United Airlines Flight 93, was also on its way to the capital city. Most people think his target was the Capitol building, or the White House, the president's house. A group of brave passengers, hearing the news of what was happening in the country, decided to shoot down the giant plane even though they knew they would not survive. They raided the cabin and took control of the kidnappers. The plane flew out of control, colliding into a camp in the state of Pennsylvania, where all passengers were killed.
In total, some 3,000 Americans lost their lives that day, but the American spirit was not suppressed. Those responsible for the attacks quickly faced each other, and the country soon began its path to recovery. September 11, 2001, a day America will never forget.",B2
"Police arrested a rich boy driving a yellow Lamborghini in Miami Beach and arrested him on suspicion of driving under influence as he allegedly ran down the street. It happens, but when it happens to Justin Bieber, it's beyond a big problem.
The teenage idol is only the last young star who has problems with the police and public relations people. But is it to be expected when a teenager has fame and access to so much wealth?
Tons of young stars with more money than years ago have encountered such problems before. For many, standing on the precipice of adulthood or something beyond that line, it has seemed to trigger a lot of problems
In recent years, Lindsay Lohan, Chris Brown and Amanda Bynes have dominated headlines with legal issues and rehabilitation periods.
These children do not have their identities established and no one says no, said Sherrie Campbell, a psychologist and author of the book, Love Yourself: The Mastery of Being Your Own Person.
These kids get all this money and stop feeling like they act and act until they get into trouble, almost having to lose everything to experience what they have, he said.
Bieber's had both.
According to Forbes, in June 2013, the 19-year-old had income of $58 million. Since it was discovered on YouTube in 2008, the singer had enjoyed an almost clean image until last year.
Then the dogs of bad publicity hell were unleashed.
Of being accused of publicly urination the rumors of a visit to a Brazilian brothel and the running of the bulls with the police - LRB- authorities recently swarm their mansion is Calabasas, California, as part of an investigation of vandalism -RRB-, Bieber spent most of 2013 in the news for alleged misconduct.
His musical mentor Usher Raymond, a former teenage star, told MTV in December 2013 that her young protégé was experiencing the pains of growing up in the spotlight.
Successfully comes a great responsibility. And being able to grow in it and unfortunately be analyzed in front of the world for just growing up, I think they will be able to see the truth, Usher said. And they can make an evaluation based on what their reality looks like.
Lately, Bieber's reality doesn't look so good.
Meet Justin Bieber's inner circle
Former children's star Danny Bonaduce said on his Seattle radio show at KZOK-FM Thursday that Bieber's recent arrest could be just what the besieged teenage star needs right now.
This is the best thing that could have happened to him, said Bonaduce, who in the past has struggled with addiction and legal problems. Speaking from personal experience, this could save your life.
Some of her fellow celebrities have condemned her behavior while others have offered support. Psychologist Sherrie Campbell noted that fame is her own addiction and said celebrities are often under the pressure of public expectations.
I think sometimes these stars think they have to live up to their own image to the point that they almost become fans of their own image, he said.
Bieber Arrest: Celebs offers sympathy, but jokes, too
For some famous young people, this kind of skates is almost a rite of passage at this point. Britney Spears moved from the pop princess to the investigated mother when in 2006 she was filmed driving with her son Sean on her lap. A deputy was sent to Spearshome to investigate, although there were no charges for the incident.
What followed was a year of scandalous behavior including the infamous incident of shaving her hair, and Spearsfather was awarded guardianship over her fortune. Since then, Spears has managed to turn his life around, got a concert as a judge at The X Factor for a season, as well as a new boyfriend, album and residence in Las Vegas.
Other celebrities haven't bounced as much as Spears.
See Britney Spears through the years
Lindsay Lohan recently announced that she will star and produce a new film, and there is a series of six-episode documentaries on the way. But his last film was bombed and his career is nowhere near what it was once. Also, Chris Brown's reputation has never fully recovered from his 2009 arrest following the attack on the then-girlfriend Rihanna just before the Grammys. In October 2013, Brown was arrested in Washington on suspicion of beating a man, and then expelled from a rehabilitation center for acting violently.
Now Bieber is a member of the young, rich and infamous Hollywood club whose photos join his paparazzi photos. His being accused of drag racing in a sports car arrives only months after an outpouring of pain for the star Fast & Furious Paul Walker, who died in an accident where speed was a factor.
It remains to be seen what the singer's response to his latest problems will be. In the past, he's been less than sorry, telling The Hollywood Reporter in November about those who criticize his behavior, I don't care a *** f.
“I don’t mind being reckless and doing anything, but I don’t give a damn what they say,” Bieber said.

"Is this the moment when transmission becomes truly ordinary?
According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), in 2014 there were only 41 million subscribers using music streaming services worldwide. It may be the largest revenue growth area for the record business, but it's still incredibly niche. Not only that, but a significant number of those subscribers come from agreements with mobile phone operators, so it is questionable how “active” their users are. Apple's biggest conjuring trick is to take something that already exists on the market – downloads (iTunes), digital music players (Ipod) and smartphones (the iPhone) – and adapt it to make it irresistible to the main consumer. The leaked information recently suggests that Apple is trying to reach 100 million subscribers, which, based on a subscription fee of $120 per year, would generate $12 billion annually. To put it in context, the entire world value of recorded music in 2014 was just under $15 billion. Apple is good at mainstreaming products, but it's not that good.
Is this the end of the discharge?
The iTunes Store arrived in 2003 (2004 in Europe) at a time when MP3 piracy seemed insurmountable. Apple succeeded in persuading consumers to pay for the downloads and grew a huge, dominant business with an estimated 70% market share. The downloads still have most of the digital revenue for recorded music, accounting for 52% of the total digital income in 2014 according to IFPI numbers. Apple has most of this, making it the largest music retailer in the world. But discharge revenues peaked in 2013 in the UK at £283 million and fell to £249 million in 2014. The decrease in download sales hit the US. in 2013 so Apple bought Beats in 2014 for $3 billion, not only to enter the premium headphones market, but also to make the transition from music ownership (downloads) to music access (subscription transmission). Apple, and the record industry, cannot afford to get rid of the download market for the moment, so transmission and downloading will have to coexist under the Apple brand, one that represents the future while the other becomes slower and sicker. The vast majority of people like music, but they don't like it enough to pay $120 a year to listen to it; a sporadic download purchase here and there is good for them. The average cost of a music buyer in the UK in 2014, for example, was only £39.52, according to the investigation. Expecting most of them to triple their annual spending on recorded music is something even Apple is going to fight seriously.
Has Apple Connect made Apple the most artist-friendly service?
Apple has previously tried to build an artist-friendly platform through iTunes. They called it Ping and it didn't work. Apple Connect is something very different, somewhere in the middle of YouTube, Facebook and SoundCloud, letting artists post music, videos, photos and more on their profile pages. It couldn't be more 2015 if I tried. Apple, partly because of its scale and also partly because it treats music as “art” rather than “content,” has generally had strong relationships not only with the music industry but with the artists themselves and, in general, has a good reputation among artists. Compare that to Spotify, which has been criticized by Thom Yorke's Radiohead artists with Taylor Swift. In contrast, Apple is like a benevolent guy. There's the smell of revolution in the air and Apple is making sure it's on the right side of the battle lines when they're drawn.
Where are the artist's exclusives?
This is going to be the interesting part when the service actually goes live. Getting exclusive to big albums is going to be crucial to the broadcast. Spotify paid a lot of money to get Led Zeppelin and Metallica exclusively. Apple will have been watching this carefully and making its own notes. You already have AC/DC and Beatles catalogs exclusively to download to iTunes, but it remains to be seen if you can persuade these two to make the jump in streaming. He also managed to get Beyoncé's surprise album in 2013 before anyone else, so it's inevitable that he wants more like this. There is a lot of speculation about Apple seeking exclusive rights for Adele's new album.
Giving iTunes the exclusive download on an album wasn't a big leap of faith for acts given how much of the download market it controls, but trying to do that on streaming isn't the same. Add to this the fact that streaming now counts towards the album's chart in markets like the UK and USA. and artists, who still see the letter as a measure of success, will not want to limit their audience by restricting themselves to a single service.
Is this gonna kill Spotify?
Some people are already saying Apple Music will destroy rivals like Spotify. However, it is not that simple. Apple is entering a market where others have been working and gaining experience for many years. He's got a lot to do to catch up. The winner of this battle will not be the company with the best service; it will be the company with the most money. Apple's competitors have an advantage in the market, but they are losing huge amounts of money. Spotify, for example, lost €93.1 million in 2013. Apple, on the other hand, began 2015 becoming the most profitable company in corporate history, with $178 billion in the bank. If Apple Music loses money from Apple, the company will not continue for long, but will not stop the investment without at least trying to beat the competition.

"At the age of 16, my innocence was shattered when two gunmen murdered 13 people in my school and injured many others.
Columbine High School promised to be a safe place to learn. And that promise was broken on April 20, 1999.
That morning, I went to school worried about my tenth grade math exam and my next track meeting. Useless concerns: The test was never given and we never held the meeting.
The scars have remained since that day that no one can see. Scars that made my concerns about math tests or follow-up performance pale compared to whether my scientific partner would live or whether my classmate's speech would be affected by the shrapnel lodged in his skull. Today, those mental scars are pounding in large crowds and forcing me to scan the room for exits. They make my heart beat faster when I hear the blades of a helicopter above it.
Now, as a teacher in my eighth year in the classroom, I consider every day I'm going to work a privilege. I appreciate the joy and enthusiasm of my students, and most importantly, their innocence.
I think it's our job, as a society, to protect these virtues in our young people. I want you to worry about math tests and follow-up meetings and science fairs and student council elections, the kind of normal school stuff that builds character. But our epidemic of armed violence is creating a culture of fear in our schools, where students are anxious for safety and intruders. These are concerns that no student should have.
This becomes even more evident when we perform our monthly emergency drill at our school. It's a way to be prepared for the worst, so we practice closures, fire drills and evacuations.
The other day, I was explaining to my third graders that we were going to practice a lockdown just in case a bear was in the playground... a real setting for our Colorado school. I have used this example all my teaching career because it is an easy and non-threatening reason to practice a blockade.
A girl raised her hand and asked: Is this what we would do if a bad boy came with a gun to hurt us? I felt kicked in my stomach when I heard this question. A bear is no longer the worst thing students can anticipate: they fear what is happening in our nation.
It is a shame that my students learn these exercises at such an early age, a shame that they learn them at all. I thought, this is the result of the Columbine shootings, along with many other acts of violence. This is my reality, and now it's theirs too.
It's a sad reality, but we're not helpless. I teach at a wonderful school, which has done everything within its resources to keep our students safe. But it's not enough. If there was a simple solution, then this epidemic of violence would have ended. The solution is complex, multifaceted and achievable. I believe that a global approach can help ensure a safe learning environment.
â $cents Our children deserve more mental health resources to identify, treat, and track people who need help.
â $cents Our children deserve greater school security: This includes identifying who is in school and sensible steps to keep the building safe -- without bringing weapons to the learning place or turning it into a fortress.
â $cents Our children deserve common sense weapons legislation: I think this should include a ban on high-capacity magazine clips. And at the very least, it should include comprehensive and mandatory background reviews to help keep weapons out of the hands of dangerous people. Unfortunately, our Congress refused to take this step of common sense and rejected this legislation.
The shooters at my school got their guns illegally, through private sales and straw purchases. Today they could easily go online and buy those same weapons without a background check. What is it to stop the next person who chooses to do exactly that?
We can do better.
I think I can speak on behalf of all of us that the murders at Columbine High School, Aurora cinema, Sandy Hook Elementary, and so many others surprised us to the bottom and created lasting feelings of sadness. But we cannot let these events create feelings of vulnerability. We have the power to work together to create a safer world for our students.
Learn from my experience -- don't wait until you experience first-hand violence to realize that we need to take action. We have to take action now.

"Seven police officers were killed and nine injured on Tuesday in a series of attacks on security checkpoints in the western Iraqi province of Anbar, police said.
The attacks occurred in the city of al-Rutba, a predominantly Sunni Muslim community that for a few years was an al-Qaeda stronghold after the U.S.-led invasion of the country in 2003.
In Tuesday's first attack, a suicide car bombing at a police checkpoint in the north of al-Rutba killed four police officers and injured three others, police officers said in Ramadi, the provincial capital.
Later, armed men attacked several security checkpoints in the city, killing three police officers and wounding six, the police said.
No information was available on the accidents of the attackers, beyond the suicide bomber. Al-Rutba is about 435 kilometers - LRB- 270 miles -RRB - west of the country's capital, Baghdad.
Also on Tuesday, a car bomb exploded near a crowded market in the centre of the Iraqi city of Musayib in Babil province, killing one person and wounding 11, police said in Baghdad.
Musayyib, a largely Shiite village, is about 70 kilometres (LRB-43 miles) south of Baghdad.
Iraq has seen a sharp increase in tension between its Shia and Sunni populations since April, when security forces raided a place used by Sunni protesters to protest against the Shia-led government.
The Sunnis, who represent a minority of Iraqis, have felt politically marginalized since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003. Shia make up the majority of Iraqis.
So far in 2013, more than 6,000 people have died in Iraq. More than 350 of those deaths occurred this month, and nearly 1,000 occurred in September.

"Maria is sitting in a black plastic chair in a community center in a cold Tuesday afternoon waiting for them to call her number. She's number 34.
When it comes to her, Maria is called to pick up a bag of brown paper full of essentials, including pasta, eggs and corn flakes, and is invited to choose between pumpkin or carrots like this week's vegetables.
Maria is the 34th “client” to date in East Hampton Food Pantry, a community initiative set up a few blocks away from some of the world’s most expensive and exclusive properties. At the end of the day, the pantry organizers expect more than 400 families to have followed Mary through the gates to pick up their weekly meal package to help them overcome the cold and dark winter of Long Island.
In summer, the Hamptons, a collection of historic seaside towns and villages 100 miles from Manhattan, is a multimillion-dollar playground. But, Labor Day comes in early September, when the rich and famous close their mansions and return to Manhattan or Beverly Hills, the glow gives way to the sandy reality of life for the mostly immigrant community living here all year round. “The people who come here are rich and famous, but we who live here are not,” says Maria, who works 14 hours a day in summer cleaning mansions but spends months without any work in winter.
Maria laughs when asked if she has enough money. “There is no work in winter, only in summer,” says Maria, who, like many workers in Hamptons, is from Latin America. “Here, many people live in a single room because they can’t afford the rent.”
She says that some families with up to five children are crowded in basements and still pay more than $1,000 a month for rent. “People come here looking for work but, in winter, there is nothing.”
Many of his friends can't afford heating or medication and many would starve if it wasn't for the East Hampton food pantry, he says, which is just one of several food pantryes in the city.
Vicki Littman, president of the East Hampton food pantry, which provided more than 31,000 food parcels in 2015, says the number of people looking for food pantry is increasing. “Once Labor Day arrives and the season ends and people’s hours begin to shrink, our numbers amount to about 400 families a week,” he says. “When they come to us on Tuesday, they receive two to three days of food. Without us, they would fight much more.” Littman says it can be difficult for outsiders to realize that there are people struggling to survive in a place known to the world for their excess.
“When I discuss with the summer community that comes here about food breads, they are always surprised because there is that glamorous side of the Hamptons where there are galas and the beaches and mansions that are here. “But what people don’t realize is that there is that service industry. It's the landscapers, the nannies, the waitresses, they all depend on that summer income to spend the winter, but people don't see it when they go on vacation.
“There are older people who sometimes have to choose between paying for their medicines or paying their bills or buying food, and that shouldn’t be the case.”
Littman says the city has lost too many people working on key jobs – such as teachers, police, and even doctors and dentists – because they cannot afford to live in the community and the pantry board is determined to do more to ensure that people have a better chance of staying. Housing is by far the highest cost in the Hamptons. At $147m, the nation's most expensive property is 18-acre Barry Rosenstein hedge fund manager facing the sea at 67 plus Lane, a stone's throw from Maidstone Golf Club, which is considered ""the most elite, prestigious and difficult to enter"" of all Hamptons clubs.
Larry Cantwell, an East Hampton city supervisor and a lifelong resident, says that households regularly switch hands to more than $25 million and the rapid price inflation at the top end has been reduced to the city's most modest floors.
“Finding your first home is a challenge in an area like this,” says Cantwell. “Not only the people you would characterize as poor, working and middle-class families are also having a hard time. If you can find a house to buy anywhere in East Hampton for $500,000, you are very lucky.” Cantwell says that more than half of the city’s houses are empty for most of the year, which makes the population decrease to just 10,000 in the winter months compared to 80,000 in August. “It’s kind of a history of two cities. There is certainly a lot of wealth here, but almost all that wealth is in second homes only used in the summer,” says Cantwell, the son of a fishing father and a house cleaning mother. “But, the rest of us live here all year.
“There are famous and very rich people, but then there are working and poor people who struggle to survive. It should be remembered that this community was founded as an agricultural and fishing community of people living on land and water, a true working class community.”
Cantwell says saving enough money to buy his first home while working as a farmer or fisherman is almost impossible in East Hampton today “and it’s not just the poor – cops, teachers, young professionals and others all struggle to find a place to live here and many of them can’t afford to have their own home.”
Being homeless in the Hamptons means spending a lot of time on a bus. Several houses of worship have come together to make sure there is somewhere where homeless people can spend the night during the winter. Churches up and down the north and south fork of Long Island assume the burden one night at a time and approximately 50 homeless people are transported between them every day. Eddie Vallone, 22, is one of those on the bus every night. “People see the Hamptons as some kind of rich town and there are no problems. But there are a lot of problems here, especially drugs.
“It’s hard to understand –”OK, summer is coming to an end. What am I going to do for winter?'' Vallone says in Maureen’s Haven, a charity that coordinates the homeless shelter program. “I want to work, but there is no work to do.”
Vallone, who works cleaning pools and doing occasional jobs on luxury estates, says that if she saves well and doesn't buy by impulse, she can make her summer profits extend until November. “But the work doesn’t start again until May or early June.”

"Why do it? Talking to men destined to be the elite referees of the future, the question provokes a conscious smile. This season, criticism of referees has increased to the point where some former referees have felt compelled to complain about the rules. That is quite surprising because, the more you talk to referees, the more obvious it is that leaning on each other through thick and thin is fundamental.
Then why do it? Why spend countless hours driving around the country to eliminate the rules, some of which are inevitably going to bother people, trying to climb the ladder until you have the opportunity to make decisions on television in front of millions of people who examine you and your ability with the help of umpteenths of different angles and slow-motion reproductions?
A look at an answer appears on Lee Swabey's face moments after he blows the final whistle of a 2-1 victory for Grimsby over Woking, a match at level 5 of the English league system. He gets what all the referees expect every time they submit a game. Twenty-two handshakes, he then proudly explains. Symbolically, a complete set of handshakes, plus a “well done” of both managers, represents maximum satisfaction. “The buzz,” as he calls it, of a game that passes smoothly, is something he loves. “I wouldn’t spend so much time away from my family if this didn’t mean anything to me.”
As one of the groups that is highly regarded by the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) for its potential, Swabey knew it was being watched in that game. PGMOL chief Mike Riley was present, along with Steve Dunn, who is the coach of this level, armed with notes and chronometer to catalogue every significant movement that officials make.
A few weeks earlier, Riley, Dunn and another former referee, Peter Jones, made their way to another level 5 match to monitor another arbiter inclined to progress: John Brooks. “I hope to have the opportunity to ascend the Premier League and officiate some of the best games in this country,” Brooks says.
Most of PGMOL's delegation could observe, however, was the way Brooks handled the somewhat complicated situation of cancelling the game due to a frozen pitch. It's all part of the experience Brooks needs to acquire before more high-profile games are entrusted to him, the different problems they need to deal with – often, clubs are very reluctant to have a late postponement, especially when they have to pay for all the staff that has appeared but won't receive any door money.
Brooks called his coach to ask for advice and made the difficult but correct decision. A little later, the secretary of the football club arrived with envelopes to pay officials for their time – the match rate at level 5 is £95, so it is safe to assume that these men do not do it for cash.
Brooks, like Swabey, has clear ambitions for progress. It is under no illusion that developing thick skin and perfecting strategies to deal with disappointments is a large part of that. How does it feel to watch football on TV when a referee is vilified? “Erm... it’s not great,” he admits. “I have been in that situation once I have made an incorrect decision and was a decisive target that was out of place. Your heart is sinking. You can't stop thinking about it.
“Sometimes I want people to understand the time and effort we put in. It is very easy to criticize a decision, but we do everything we can to make these decisions right. In certain situations, you’re going to be unpopular but, if you’re uncomfortable with that, you’re probably in the wrong job.”
The former referees agree that the support, education and tools that referees have today is a world far from what they experienced in their own days. Riley, as a young referee, went out and bought books on psychology and nutrition, as there was no information offered to him.
Contrast this with Brooks, who has a coach at the end of the phone. They consult weekly, discuss how their games have gone, study images of key decisions and discover how to improve. It also has the support of a sports psychologist, Liam Slack, for regular guidance and an exercise regimen to help you manage the 11 km you run during a game.
Brooks says psychology is vital in its development. “One of the things we’ve talked about is forgetting decisions and moving forward,” he explains. “There can be a big decision to make in the first 30 seconds of the game. Once you have done that, you need to stay focused for the next 89 minutes and not be wondering if that was right or worrying about that decision. Liam has taught us some techniques to release that decision. Working with the sports psychologist is very important for mental hardness.”
Jones believes that the whole approach can only help. “I referred to professional football but, looking back, I was an amateur,” he says. “I was going to work – I worked for British Telecom – and I could be a referee in Newcastle on a Wednesday night and, at 9 a.m. the next morning, I was in Leicester trying to talk to customers. Maybe I hadn't slept. The training was special. We were amateurs in a professional environment compared to now.”
When the issue of technology arises, the three former referees are unanimous in their support for it. “We are all in favour of anything that improves the referee’s work and makes them more effective in the field of play,” Riley says. Minimizing errors is the goal. After all, a bad decision can stay with you for a while. “The rest of your life,” Jones says with a laugh.

"Yesterday Stephen returned from a trip to Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States. His visit took place during the week before 4 July. Logically, there were many activities and celebrations in the city in preparation for Independence Day. During his stay in the city, Stephen visited many historic sites and important monuments, and left with a deeper understanding of the political history of the United States.
Stephen spent a lot of time outdoors exploring the important monuments surrounding the Capitol. Of course, he saw the White House from his outside door on 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Stephen also visited the Washington Monument, the Jefferson Memorial and the Lincoln Memorial. These statues and pavilions are dedicated to former American presidents. They commemorate the contributions these leaders made throughout American history. Washington, D.C. also has several war monuments dedicated to fallen soldiers during the major wars of the 20th century.
Far from the Capitol Hill area, Washington, D.C. has many museums and art galleries that are worth visiting. Stephen enjoyed his visit to Washington, D.C. because he learned much more about American history after going through every major milestone.",B2
"One of the most beautiful and recognizable monuments in California is the Golden Gate Bridge in the city of San Francisco. The bridge crosses San Francisco Bay, and is part of a network of five main bridges that cross the bay in the San Francisco and Oakland area. The region with its bay has one of the most impressive views in the world, and part of which is the historic Golden Gate Bridge.

It is perhaps the most emblematic and recognizable landmark of all the United States. The construction of the bridge began in 1933, while the country was deeply immersed in the Great Depression. Many people think that the bridge was largely responsible for the economic recovery of the country due to the number of workers employed. The material used to build the bridge also contributed to manufacturing, distribution and transportation.
The bridge connects San Francisco with the San Francisco Peninsula in Marin County via California State Route 1 and United States Route 101. Before the bridge was built, the only way to get from one place to another was to surround the bay or take a ferry. The construction of the bridge was controversial at the time. Many thought the project was simply too complex, expensive and dangerous to build. The approved construction plan focused on the safety of workers who would be involved in the construction, and worked well until 17 February 1937. Notably, only one worker had died by that date, but on that date, a scaffolding collapsed killing 10 men in the tragic accident.
The bridge was completed at the end of that year, and has been in use ever since. It's one of California's big milestones with people all over the world attracted to seeing it.",B2
"One of the biggest barriers during the childhood of air travel was the speed of sound. It was considered impossible to build and fly a plane that could exceed this speed, but that was before the world was introduced to Chuck Yeager. Yeager was already a combat pilot consummated in World War II, but his greatest achievement was after the war when he served as a test pilot for the United States Air Force. It was thought that it was impossible to fly faster than sound during that period, and no one knew if a pilot could survive flying at that speed, or how it would affect him if he survived. But that didn't deter Yeager.

Yeager was born on February 13, 1923 in Myra, West Virginia. He served during World War II as a combat pilot. However, he did not start as a pilot. Yeager enlisted as a soldier who worked as an airplane mechanic in the former Army Air Forces, where Yeager enrolled in a special program that trained enlisted men to become pilots. Yeager benefited greatly from having a higher view. He was considered a natural pilot at the beginning of his flight career.
As a fighter pilot at the European Theatre, Yeager was shot down in France by German fighter planes. He avoided capture, and helped a fellow pilot to be safe after the pilot had lost his leg in the accident. Yeager was awarded a medal for his actions. He showed exceptional talent as a pilot and once shot down five enemy fighters in one day. After the war, Yeager began a new race as a test pilot, where he flew the experimental Bell X-1 aircraft in the history of aviation.
On October 14, 1947, Yeager flew his X-1 faster than the speed of sound. He became the first human to fly faster than sound, and continued to break more records during his 60 years of flight history. Yeager retired from the army with the rank of Brigadier General, and has earned many honors for his contributions to aviation.",B2
"The American Revolution was a war of independence waged by those living in the 13 colonies of North America against Britain. Those who lived in the colonies were especially angry at the taxes the British were forcing them to pay. People felt that taxes were unfair because there was no colonial representation in the British parliament. One tax was the stamp tax, which taxed printed materials as newspapers. The settlers called this ""imposition without representation."" The settlers who wanted to free themselves from English rule were known as Patriots. Those who supported the British government were known as loyalists. Before the large-scale war broke out, there were many acts of protest by patriots, such as the Boston Tea Party when the Bostonians boarded British ships and threw 342 boxes of tea into the port due to a tea tax. On April 19, the first shots were fired in Lexington and Concord, Massachusetts, which officially started the war.

Many people participated in the struggle for independence. Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams worked together to write the Declaration of Independence. On July 4, 1776, the patriots declared themselves free. Most people know that George Washington was the first president of the United States. Before that he was the commander-in-chief of the patriot army. Most of the battles in the American Revolution were fought in the northeast in places near Boston and New York.
The British, known as red coats because of their red uniform jackets, were assisted by German mercenary soldiers called Hessians. The patriots had the support of other Europeans. France entered the American Revolution on the colonists' side in 1778. This helped force British surrender in Yorktown, Virginia, in 1779. However, the struggle would not formally end until 1783 with the Treaty of Paris, when Britain recognized the United States as an independent nation.",B2
"You could see it in his eyes.
Even before Pope Francis spoke his first words to the crowds of St.Peter's Square, he could look into his eyes and feel the wonder.
The world looked at him. But he also looked at something: on all those scrambled faces. With all eyes looking at him.
Nothing can prepare a person for such a vision.
In this life, there are moments, and then there are Moments. The first appearance of a new Pope on the balcony of St.Peter's Basilica has always been a moment like no other.
Before telegraphy, before radio, before television, before the Internet, before Twitter, the vision - the solemn orchestration - of a newly elected Pope standing on the balcony was the most dramatic way possible to bring great news to the world.
Somehow it still is.
“I would like to thank you for your embrace,” the new Pope said, looking into all those eyes.
When authors and speakers have sought ways to express the last example of reverential exaltation, the scene periodically repeated in St.Peter's Square, over the centuries, has often been the one they have addressed.
Tom Wolfe, in his book The Right Stuff, on Mercury's original astronauts, wanted to describe to readers the level of devotion that the newly appointed astronauts had received from the American people. The seven pilots had been precisely that -- combat pilots, test pilots -- before being selected for the space program. Suddenly, they were something else. People saw them and started crying.
Wolfe came up with the only ideal analogy to portray the phenomenon:
The kids wouldn't have cared about the following. They would not have cared to appear once a year on a balcony over a huge square where half the world meets. They greet each other. The world roars its approval, its applause, and it breaks in a storm of thirty minutes of cheers and tears... A little flattery in the order of the Pope; that is all the True Brothers at the top of the pyramid really wanted.
But humility is not required by combat pilots and astronauts. Nor is it required of rock stars or professional athletes or any of the many other public artists, in disparate places, who are regularly presented with carefully planned and commercialized majesty designed to elevate them in the eyes of their audiences.
A Pope is different, and his introduction to the world is like no other. When Wednesday morning dawned in Rome, a man named Jorge Mario Bergoglio was one of millions of people preparing to begin the new day.
When the day ended, he was no longer Jorge Mario Bergoglio, and he was no longer one of the millions.
As Pope Francis, he climbed that balcony and was received by that view.
From behind his glasses, he took everything.
The eyes of the world met theirs.
He asked for prayers.
The views expressed in this commentary are only those of Bob Greene.

"Thousands of people protested on the beaches of Australia against a shark massacre in Western Australia. They asked the state's prime minister to stop the sacrifice, and RSPCA Australia and Virgin Atlantic owner Richard Branson criticized him. The capture and killing of sharks over three metres began after several shark attacks on the west coast of Australia. A 35-year-old surfer, who was killed in November 2013, was the sixth person to die of a shark attack in two years.
But all of Australia has had, on average, a single shark-related death a year over the past 50 years. Kate Faehrmann of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society said of a protest in Perth, the capital of Western Australia: “We have always said that this idea will not work. The drums, used to catch sharks, kill sharks if they are one, two, three meters or more, and also dolphins, turtles and other things. That’s why we don’t want the sacrifice.”
Thousands of people protested on the beaches of Perth, Sydney and Adelaide, and on the beaches of Victoria and Queensland. Faehrmann said the protests showed that Australians wanted sharks to be protected: “The amazing thing is that so many people in Australia love sharks. This has shown that people are scared, but thousands of people are going across the country to say, ‘That’s the ocean of sharks.’ We respect them, we love them and we don’t want them killed.’ Anthony Joyce, a surfer who once had his foot stuck in a shark’s mouth, said: “The number of sharks they’re going to kill is not going to make any difference.”
The state government will not say how many sharks they have killed, but some people say that sharks under three meters were released after they were caught on drums, floating drums fixed to the seabed with bait on hooks under them. Conservationists say there is no evidence that the sacrifice reduces the number of shark attacks on humans, because no other sacrifice has only used drums. Researchers at the University of Western Australia say that the increase in the number of shark attacks in the state may be due to the fact that Western Australia has the fastest growing population in Australia, not due to an increase in the number of sharks.
Richard Peirce of the UK-based conservation charity Shark Trust said the sacrifice would not work and could bring more predators to the coast. “The activity in Western Australia is in addition to the human tragedy of shark attacks. It is very sad that a government has ignored the best advice and chosen an ineffective and counterproductive method,” he said, “and, although they monitor drum lines during the day, leaving the lines at night could attract other predators to the area, attracted by those sharks and other species attracted and injured.”
Around the world, in 2012, there were 80 shark attacks. Seven of the attacks were fatal. This compares to nearly 100 million sharks killed by humans each year. RSPCA Australia says she thinks the sacrifice is wrong. “There is no evidence that the increase in attacks is the result of an increase in the number of sharks. We believe it is the result of a change in the population and a change in human behavior; that is, there are more people in the water,” he said.
Richard Branson said the idea wasn't working. “I’m sure one of the reasons Western Australia’s Premier Colin Barnett did this was because he was thinking it would promote tourism. He's gonna do the opposite, I think. You are announcing a problem that does not exist in a big way and you will stop people from wanting to come to Perth and your beautiful field around you. All you’re going to accomplish, I think, is worry people.”

"One of the richest women in the United States is Meg Whitman, executive director of Hewlett-Packard. Whitman is an educated person from the Ivy League who is the fourth richest woman in the state of California, and is on list No. 20 on the Forbes list of the richest women in the United States. She graduated from Princeton University, where she earned her B.A. in Economics in 1977. After Princeton, Whitman obtained his MBA at Harvard Business School in 1979. She originally wanted to study medicine, but changed her specialty early in Princeton.

Whitman has found success wherever he has worked. She began her career working at Proctor and Gamble before joining Walt Disney Corporation, where she served as vice president of strategic planning in 1989. He also worked for Stride Rite and Hasbro Corporations. His greatest success was over a period of 10 years working for eBay.
When Whitman took eBay in 1998, the online auction, and the retail business was making about $4 million in annual sales. When he left the company in 2008, the business had grown to a giant of $8 billion. EBay went from employing 30 employees in 1998 to employing more than 15,000 during his tenure as CEO of the company. Whitman won several awards for her work on eBay, and Forbes Magazine placed her among the five most powerful women in the country.
Whitman is a moderate Republican who supported Mitt Romney's failed presidential campaign in 2008. He ran for governor of California in 2010, but lost to Jerry Brown. She hopes to run for president in the future, and is on the list as one of the most likely women to become president of the United States.",B2
"Kit Skogsbergh can see it now.
He'd be a buddy, he said. He'd have a soft, soothing voice... he'd be like Piglet in Pooh's movies because he'd be a little cautious and scared of things, but once he knew the plan and how things worked it would warm up and maybe at the end of the movie he wouldn't have to shoot in a ball - LRB- and hide -RRB-. He'd be able to face things head-on.
The 32-year-old boy from Pasadena, California, recently filed a petition at Change.org asking Disney to make an animated character from a pangolin, a little-known and scaled mammal that is notoriously shy and, according to Kit, can protect himself from almost anything in nature -- lions, tigers -- rolling in a ball.
Pangoline is being trafficked into extinction, sold for its scales, which are used in traditional medicine, and for its meat, which is a delicacy in Vietnam and China. The pangolins are exchanged for the ton.
Disney could give the pangolin the celebrity he needs to survive.
I encourage you to sign Kit's petition on Change.org.
If people care about pangolin the way they care about tigers or elephants, they could easily be saved from extinction. The problem: Few seem to realize that these incredibly introverted animals exist. They are poorly studied and barely understood. Nor are they conventionally cute, which makes it easier for conservation organizations and the public to cancel them as expendable. However, they are essential and valuable creatures.
I recently went to Vietnam and Indonesia as part of CNN's Change the List project to document the massive illegal trade in endangered pangoline species. I hadn't heard of the pangolins before readers voted for me to cover the illegal trade in animals as part of that project; and Kit hadn't heard of them until he read the story last week.
I came halfway - LRB- the story -RRB- and my stomach hurt so much that I couldn't finish it, Kit told me last week. I had a feeling I should do something about it.
Kit's petition -- titled Helping the beautiful and mysterious pangolins by presenting them in an animated movie! - I had 1,425 signatures on Monday morning. At least 13 other readers also started petitions urging Disney to put a pangoline character in an animated or short film, according to Pulin Modi, a senior activist on Change.org.
Disney and Disney Pixar have the power to make pangolin popular. And they don't have to do it because of the goodness of their hearts. It could be a success. Pangolins are the last losers... adorable and reserved, curious and little known.
The pangolin mothers carry their babies on their backs; the pangolin hang from the trees by their tails; and their tongues are longer than their bodies.
In addition, Disney already has a selection of names. CNN readers are voting on a name for Pangolin P26, which was rescued from the wildlife trade and recently launched back into nature in Vietnam. Some of the names would be perfect for an animated character: Pemalu, who is Indonesian for shy ; Bao, Vietnamese for protection. Or Percival, which is alliterative and fun.
When you introduce a character in a Disney movie the animal suddenly gets more recognition and people start talking about it, Kit said, who is a Disney fan.
That education and awareness is what will help shape future generations. Maybe we can start with younger people and they can grow up without wanting to eat pangolin.
It may seem crazy that any Disney spectator eats pangolin. But not for Kit, who is Chinese-American and who told me that his father has probably consumed endangered wildlife products while doing business in China, possibly including pangolin.
It has been a source of family conflict.
It's like talking to a piece of cheese, you don't get anywhere, he said of his conversations with his father about the welfare of endangered animals. It's funny for him that people are worried about what happens to an animal, because it's just an animal, it's nothing more than that. It offers nothing but food, nutrition or medicinal properties. He laughs and says it makes you live longer or makes your skin nice. And he'll say, ""You're crazy! Americans!
She doesn't think she can persuade her father to change, but younger generations may be the ones saving animals like pangolins and rhinos, she said.
And Disney could catch up with them.
Kit's story is proof it could work.
Kit was born in the United States, and developed a fondness for animals when he was young. Her parents valued the animals for their role -- Doom the Doberman's ability to protect their home, their ducklings -- but she saw them as friends.
Maybe he didn't have enough friends and animals were always super friendly all the time, he said. I feel it's very easy to make friends with animals. He now has three cats -- Cheezburger, Monster and Ninja -- and a rabbit named Bunny.
She became an animal advocate because she got to know them.
As a Chinese-American, I also want to talk because demand in China is helping boost demand for pangolins to be killed by meat and medicine, writes in the Change.org petition. I can tell you that many Chinese citizens do not support this cruelty, and I think we can bring together wildlife advocates from all over the world to ask Disney to take this simple, fun and positive step to help the pangolins.
It didn't cost me more than half an hour of my time, he said of the petition.
And it would take a lot less time to sign it.

"One of the most shocking television series in history on American television was Married to Children. The program was broadcast on FOX for 11 years, and many believe it was responsible for keeping the news station alive for the first few years.

In 1987, commercial television in the United States was dominated by the three majors: the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and the Columbia Broadcasting Company (CBS). When the FOX Channel appeared on the scene, few people gave it much opportunity to survive in the face of its tough competition, but Married with Children changed all that.
The show followed the exploits of a dysfunctional family living in a fictional Chicago suburb. The main character was the father, Al Bundy, who was an adorable loser who lived with his self-centered wife, and snotty children. Together, the family makes Al's life miserable as he stumbles, and he wobbles his way through life. Al works as a shoe salesman who pays very little, and has little chance of promotion.
Al is a loving character who won the worship of the American public for many years. Actor Ed O'Neil, who played Al, said that people are still approaching him this day by calling him Al, or Mr Bundy. O'Neil also said playing the character for so many years made it difficult for him to find work once the series ended because people associated him with Al.
One of the things that made the show so popular is that no subject was beyond the writers' limits. This is a controversial programme dealing with controversial issues. Many people boycotted the program because of its rabid content, but FOX continued. The show has cultivated a cult-following that began in the 1980s, and continues today.",B2
"The problem with Google Glasses, Takahito Iguchi says, is that they are not great. He's right. There is already a website dedicated to people who use them look ridiculous or cocky or, more often, both. It probably wasn't Google's smartest move to launch the first 10,000 pairs to software developers instead of, for example, supermodels or Scarlett Johansson. Google Images search and one of the first hits is an image of a big, naked man taking them in the shower. And this is what Iguchi, a Japanese businessman, hopes can be Google's Achilles' heel. He's throwing a competitor that's a little more stylized. A little more Blade Runner. A little more Japanese.
Iguchi's augmented reality goggles, which are actually not as much glasses as a single piece of metal with a camera and microprojector, are called Telepathy One, and after unveiling them at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, they have attracted $5 million venture capital. Like Glass, Telepathy One will be launched in 2014.
It's a stripped, simplified version of Google Glass. While Glass is, he says, “a selfish device” with a wide range of uses – it can navigate the network, read emails, take photographs, do unspecified things with yet unspecified applications – Telepathy will be “more than one communication device.” Connected via Bluetooth to your phone, it will focus on real-time visual and audio exchange. You can post photos and videos from your line of view on Facebook or send them as email. Or watch and talk with a floating video image of a friend.
“It will help you get close to your friends and family. We are very focused on the possibilities of communication and sharing,” says Iguchi, who has worked in the Japanese technology industry for 20 years, the most recent of which is developing a location-based telephone application called Sekai Camera.
Of course, not everyone wants to approach the man in the futuristic headphones, I point out. Iguchi shakes his head. “I am a visionary. I have a dream that people will understand other people. When I go to London, I'm a stranger. Sometimes I feel scared. But I think everyone wants to be understood and understand each other. And, with this device, you can learn more about people before you even talk to them.”
Compared to Google's tastes, of course, Telepathy is a minnow. Not that this seems to dazzle Takahito Iguchi. In his shared office space in San Francisco – a fresh and converted warehouse in the heart of the land of startup, full of 20-year-olds – he quotes Sun Tzu's Art of War and points out that even small armies can sometimes defeat powerful forces. When it was growing, Japanese technology ruled the world: the Sony Walkman was the iPhone of its time. Now, to compete, he had to leave Tokyo for Silicon Valley.
“Tokyo is very rich in fashion and culture, but it is still an island. He's isolated. There's no way to expand. Whereas, in Silicon Valley, they're all from everywhere. It’s where you come to connect globally.” Hardware will be done in Japan, while he’s gathering a team of software engineers in the US. to develop their applications. The day I meet him, a Japanese news crew is following him and is interested in the new wave of Japanese businessmen who are forced to leave their homeland.
We're losing our confidence, correspondent Takashi Yanagisawa tells me. “And we need to find a way to regain our power. Iguchi is like the new border. We hope it can be a new solution. Building the prototype of Telepathy One was easy, says Iguchi. “We have all kinds of technology in Tokyo. He is presenting it to the world that is the challenge.” The main manufacturers line up to work with him, he says, because they have the technology, they just struggle to sell it. “There has to be a story for the product. Like Apple did with the iPod – 1,000 songs in his pocket. And the way they positioned themselves against Microsoft and IBM was like the story of David and Goliath. And Steve Jobs was inspired by Akio Morita, Sony’s co-founder, and he inspired me, so he might come in a circle.”
Maybe. He certainly has the confidence of Jobs, although, with a strong Japanese accent, he sometimes struggles to make himself understood, a fact that may have contributed to the conception of Telepathy One. When he went to London to present the headphones at the prestigious Founders Forum, he stayed at an Airbnb. “The owner of the house was not my friend, but I talked to him for three hours, and now he’s my friend. That is the time it takes to understand, to share our feelings, background and career. Maybe telepathy makes it shorter. If you are getting information from the cloud and social media, that will happen more easily. And this man is involved in getting investments from the UK to Africa, and he was very excited about telepathy, which would be a way to educate people about Africa, to show them the point of view of other people.”
This is Iguchi's most affectionate hope – that seeing someone else's literal point of view will help you see his metaphorical point of view. As a student, he explains, studied philosophy by day and was taught to code at night. “And one day, I opened the door to my apartment and suddenly realized that everything is code. That was my enlightenment. Everything is encoded and shared among humans. And everything can be coded and decoded. And, if the code is interchangeable among humans, that will end all war between them.”

"Millenniums in the workplace
Background
The millennials (born between the early 1980s and the early 1990s) constitute a large part of our workforce, but seem to lack loyalty to companies and leaders for those who work. Multinational companies are seeing higher millennial turnover rates as employee retention rates decrease. This report analyses the results of two large-scale surveys on the mentality of the millennial generation and explores how organizations can strive to address these needs, increase employee engagement and encourage retention.
Research
In a global survey conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), more than 40,000 millenaries (born between 1983 and 1993) were collected and non-millenary responses on the themes of workplace culture, communication and working styles, wage structure, professional development, work-life balance, etc.
In a separate global survey conducted by Deloitte, more than 10,000 millennials participated in a study on their perceptions of threats and opportunities in the complex world of work.
Main findings
Millennials are as committed to their work as their senior colleagues.
The millennia value interesting work and a good balance between work and life. They do not believe that demands for excessive work are worth sacrifices in their personal lives.
Millennials want flexibility in their working hours and are willing to give up wage increases and promotions for flexible working hours. They believe that success should be measured by productivity and not by the number of hours seen in an office.
The Millennials want to feel supported and appreciated by their company and superiors.
Millennials want more opportunities to develop their skills. These include technological skills, teamwork and interpersonal skills.
Millennials believe that companies and business leaders should contribute to the improvement of society and are more likely to be loyal to a company with strong ethics.
Recommendations
Organizations and administrators wishing to retain millennials should consider:
Monitor your workload and levels of satisfaction with your work-life balance
create a flexible working culture in which employees have more control over their working hours and workplace location;
provide meaningful work and interesting opportunities
offer help and support in continuous professional development
change the organization's objectives from primarily profit-making to reasons that address social concerns and address broader social problems.",B2
"Robert Mysłajek stops dead. Between two footprints on a muddy mountain track, the scientist finds what he's looking for. Get down! He was excited. Wolf sightings are so rare that the sighting of his feces marks a good day, even for an experienced tracker.
But it's getting easier. It is estimated that there are now 1,500 wolves in Poland. The number has doubled in 15 years. Wolves are, along with the brown bear, the lynx and the worm, the last major carnivores in Europe. Conservationists in Britain, Germany and the Netherlands are beating a road here to discover how the country has saved this protected species, slandered even in fairy tales.
Pieces of bone and hair stand out from the precious black feces. “He ate a red deer,” says the University of Warsaw biologist. “In my lab, I can tell you all about this wolf, not only his diet, but also his gender, sexual habits, age, state of health and family connections.”
DNA tests have established that Polish wolves are travelers. “A wolf arrived in the Netherlands, where unfortunately he was hit by a car. They have tremendous reach. They need space. The average territory required by a Polish package is 250 km2,” Mysłajek said.
“Is there any chance that we can ever reintroduce wolves into Scotland?” asks student Alex Entwisle, 23, on a trip to southern Poland from his university in the UK. Animal science students have spent the day observing excrement and footprints in the Beskidy Mountains of the Polish Carpathians.
Their hot topic of discussion is whether to reintroduce wolves into the British Isles for the first time since the 18th century.
As a guest of a British charity, the Lobos and Humans Foundation, Mysłajek toured the Scottish Highlands in 2015 and took questions from the villagers about the Polish experience. “The big difference between Scotland and Poland is that we eat pork. We don't have many sheep here.
“The similarity is that we have many animals – 300,000 red deer and more than 800,000 deer. In Poland, we also have a massive overpopulation of wild boars – some 200,000 – and are devastating farmers’ cereal crops. Here, wolves are part of the solution,” he says.
The scientist, who is a familiar face on Polish television, says that wolves are exceptional animals that are able to move up to 30 km during a single hunt. “The Beskidy package is a strong unit, eight or nine individuals. This year, we have registered five puppies, two aged and two adults.
“We tracked them using motion-activated cameras in the forest and following their tracks in mud and snow. In each family group, only one pair is reproduced once a year. All the members of the herd care for the young with solidarity and devotion.”
Mys łajek, the son of a shepherd, is bewildered by the bad reputation of wolves. “Why is there talk of a lone gunman? Why did we have to have Little Red Riding Hood?""
He is fascinated by these distant canines that remained in nature 33,000 years ago, when others decided a much more comfortable existence as domestic dogs.
Wolves aren't faggots. Mysłajek says that only scientific arguments – the need to regenerate forests and control the wild animal population – can save Europe's wild carnivores, especially the unpopular wolf. “Natural predators balance the ecosystem. They keep the herbivores under control, thus allowing the trees to grow tall so that the birds nest in them.”
Shoot the deer? “It’s just a partial solution,” he says. “In a diverse environment, you have the so-called ‘landscape of fear’, where herbivores no longer spend all day grazing in the tender grass on the riverbank. They move away, as a precaution, to avoid being caught by a predator. This gives vegetation a chance.”
The ban on wolf hunting in the Western Carpathians came into force in 1995 and throughout the country in Poland in 1998. There are now resident packages in virtually every major forest in the country. Predators coexist with humans instead of being surrounded, as they are in African safari parks.
The Polish government pays compensation for cattle killed by wolves. Mysłajek advises farmers on the construction of electric fences. It has helped revive the use of two deterrent elements that, for reasons that no one understands very well, the wolves find particularly frightening: the red buzz (hanging around sheep pens) and the crust of the spongy white sheep of the Tatra mountain.
The survival and mobility of the wolves of Poland have been helped by the late development of the country's infrastructure. In 1989, when the communists renounced power, Poland had only one highway. Following Poland's accession to the European Union in 2004, major road projects were launched requiring impact studies on wildlife. The country now has one of the highest densities in the world of crossings and underground crossings for wild animals.
Attitudes have also changed. “For many years, hunting was cultural. In 1975, there were fewer than 100 wolves in Poland. Beginning in the 1950s, the authorities had encouraged wolf hunting. They paid a reward for killing a wolf that was worth a month's pay. It was a butchery.”
Mysłajek says that the improvement of the chances of survival of Polish wolves has been considerable, but remains fragile. The packages are mobile across borders and hunting still continues in neighboring Russia, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine and Slovakia.
He claims that Poland's new government, elected in October 2015, is hostile to wolves. “The Minister of the Environment, Jan Szyszko, makes no secret of being a hunter. There are 120,000 authorized hunters in Poland and they are influential in parliament.
“ Hunters claim that wolves are a plague and that there are 4,000 of them in Poland, which is a spurious figure based on a non-scientific recount. This government is capable of reversing.”
Being a wolf advocate isn't easy. “It’s not like you can argue to politicians that wolves are a great tourist attraction. Most tourists want to see animals but wolves stay away from humans. They have a tremendously sensitive sense of smell.
The 12 British students of animal science leave the Polish Carpathians without a sighting of wolves; only photographs of footprints and excrement. Entwisle is convinced that Scotland will never be able to match Poland's success.
“It would be amazing for the environment to have them back because of the problem of too many deer. But it would not be viable because of the roads and the sheep.
“There would be problems with farmers. We had our industrial revolution too long ago. We ruined it for ourselves. In Britain, we like predators to be far away and watch them on television, Entwisle said.

"The third Monday of January is an American federal party, Martin Luther King Jr. Day. It falls near the birthday of the civil rights leader, who was murdered in 1968. King, a minister, made himself known for protesting not violently against the treatment of African Americans in the United States and the laws that discriminated against Black people. Specifically, King protested the segregation that separated blacks and whites in public baths, public pools, public schools, buses and restaurants. King led many marches in the United States, especially in the South, where segregation was practiced and enforced, and in Washington, D.C. His march in Washington, D.C., was perhaps the most famous, where he delivered the speech ""I Have a Dream.""

On Martin Luther King Jr.'s day, federal, state, and local offices are closed, including public schools and post offices. During the holidays many people participate in marches and vigils remembering Dr. King. Others use the day as a day of service and volunteer in their community cleaning garbage in a local park or serving food to the homeless. However, the party was controversial. Some states did not want to honor Dr. King and tried to change the name of the holiday or combine the day with another holiday.
Only two other people have a U.S. national holiday, Christopher Columbus and George Washington. Martin Luther King Jr. Day became a party in 1983 after pressure from civil rights activists and marches, similar to what the king used to lead. Efforts to create a king's party began the same year King was murdered. The first state to recognize King's Day as a holiday was Illinois. The last state to recognize the party was Arizona.

"The first time I went to Libya in 2010, I was arrested two days after my trip. Filming a documentary for VICE, I was stopped for shooting where the authorities thought I shouldn't, starting endless rounds of questions, screaming emphatically and pushing my head with disbelief at my claims of innocence... and, of course, the necessary implications that I was a spy. When I was finally released, I swore I would never return to the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. But that promise quickly broke, and I found myself back in the country almost exactly a year later, in the midst of a chaotic and violent revolution.
My second trip to Libya was to travel from the Egyptian border to Benghazi and then to the front lines in Misurata, embedded with some different rebel groups along the way. I was surprised by the youth of many of them. Just after puberty and struggling with what they could find - LRB- a guy had a spear gun -RRB-, they showed so much heroism and courage that he broke me while talking to them. A rebel I spoke to had left the hospital that night -- despite losing a leg -- so that he could return to the front. An NGO offered him a flight to Germany and a new prosthetic member, but instead he snuck out of the hospital to meet with his comrades.
But the big question that was coming up above all was: Why are they fighting?
All those I asked -- bankers, shopkeepers, students, construction workers, oil engineers and former Gaddafi loyalists -- offered the same answer: Freedom. It was like the end of Braveheart every time a rebel looked into my eyes and said so. A 16-year-old boy told me he'd die so the others could at least breathe outdoors. Ugly things for a teenager, especially when most rebels are not old enough to have known a political system other than Gaddafism. Risking your life for freedom is one thing. But risking the concept of freedom is something else.
See the rest of Libya's rebels at VICE.COM
When we finally reached Misurata, he was surrounded by Gaddafi's troops and only accessible by sea. Little by little we head to the front, stopping periodically to talk to the rebels. A 15-year-old boy I met was preparing a Grad-missile truck for battle. Beaming wondered if he could ask Clinton and Obama for new weapons so they could beat Gaddafi and fulfill his dream of playing for the Miami Heat or the Dallas Mavericks. As we talked, I was surprised how much I had changed in such a short period. This was a different Libya than I experienced last year, a completely new country.

"As the outrage over a Sudanese woman sentenced to death for refusing to renounce her Christianity grows, the government defended the verdict, but said it is only preliminary.
Last week, a Khartoum court sentenced Miriam Yehya Ibrahim, 27, for apostasy or renunciation of faith.
Ibrahim, who is eight months pregnant, is a Christian, her husband said. But the court considers it Muslim.
I'm so frustrated. “I don’t know what to do,” her husband, Daniel Wani, said. I'm just praying.
100 tabs
The court also convicted her of adultery and sentenced her to 100 lashes because her marriage to a Christian man is considered null and void under sharia law.
Wani is an American lawyer, Ibrahim's lawyer, Mohamed Jar Elnabi, told CNN.
The lawyer said he'll file an appeal in a few days.
Fatih Izz Al-Deen, spokesman for the Sudanese parliament, said the verdict is not final and is in the hands of the judiciary.
The verdict will pass through all judicial stages to reach the constitutional court, the speaker told the radio station Um Dorman. His comments were quoted on Friday by the Sudanese official news agency.
Ibrahim says he was born to a Sudanese Muslim father and an Ethiopian Orthodox mother. Her father left when she was 6 years old, and was raised by her mother as a Christian.
However, the lawyer representing Ibrahim's family said on Sunday that the mother is a devout Muslim.
The court had warned Ibrahim to give up his Christianity by Thursday, but he held fast to his beliefs.
But the speaker in parliament said that the claims that she was raised as non-Muslim are false.
She is a Muslim raised in an Islamic environment and her brother, a Muslim, filed a complaint against her, according to Izz Al-Deen.
The complaint alleges that he disappeared for several years and his family was surprised to learn that he had married a Christian, according to his lawyer.
However, because her father was a Muslim, the courts also considered her one, which would mean that her marriage to a non-Muslim man was null and void.
Attempts to contact the Minister of Justice and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Sudan were unsuccessful.
Pregnant with a child in prison
Ibrahim's husband is struggling to survive.
He uses a wheelchair and depends entirely on it for all the details of his life, said Jar Elnabi, his lawyer.
In addition to her pregnancy, the couple's 20-month-old child is with her in prison, and he is receiving regular ailments due to lack of hygiene and the presence of insects, the lawyer said.
She is having a difficult pregnancy, and a request to send her to a private hospital was denied, the lawyer said.
There is also the question of the timing of a possible execution.
In previous cases involving pregnant or lactating women, the Sudanese government waited until the mother weaned her son before executing any sentence, Christian Solidarity Worldwide Kiri Kankhwende spokeswoman said.
Global condemnation
Foreign rights groups and embassies around the world condemned the verdict.
The fact that a woman can be sentenced to death for her religious choice, and to flogging for being married to a man of a supposedly different religion, is abhorrent and should never be considered, said Manar Idriss, an Amnesty International researcher in Sudan.
Katherine Perks of the African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies said the verdict goes against Sudan's own constitution and commitments under regional and international law.
The foreign embassies in Khartoum, including those in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, urged the Government to reverse the course.
CNN's Catherine Shoichet, Christabelle Fombu, Mohammed Tawfeeq and Mohammed Osman contributed to this report.

"Manchester City crushed Aston Villa 4-0 with Mario Balotelli scoring a hat-trick to temporarily reach the top of the English Premier League ahead of the city's rivals.
Although City was only in the lead for a few hours, the form of his victory suggested that they would be a factor in the title race, but for Gerard Houlier's Villa it was another discouraging defeat.
Tottenham Hotspur, who won 2-1 in Villa the day of boxing, beat Newcastle 2-0 at another launch in the afternoon to jump Chelsea in fourth place.
The goals of Aaron Lennon and Gareth Bale in the second half maintained Tottenham's impressive recent career and spurred a second consecutive defeat for Newcastle under new manager Alan Pardew.
Man Utd regain first place despite tie
Bale scored the second position after a brand race after Younes Kaboul had been sent home after getting tangled with Cheick Tiote.
In Eastlands, Balotelli turned out to be a real handful for Villa, winning an early penalty after being dragged by Eric Lichaj.
The Italian got up to convert the penalty and City was 2-0 ahead within the first 15 minutes as Joleon Lescott headed to Adam Johnson's house.
Balotelli scored his second close-up before the break-up and completed his hat-trick in the second half with his second successful penalty after Johnson was defiled by Marc Alrighton.
Manchester City Manager Roberto Mancini had a realistic view of its location in hgih.
I know we're at the top, but I think it'll only be for three hours. It is important to be there at the end of the season, the Italian told BBC Sport.
In another place, Blackpool's promotion continued its remarkable season under Ian Holloway with a 2-0 victory in Sunderland to reach the eighth, having been the favourites to return to the start of the campaign.
Two second halves of DJ Campbell gave Blackpool three points in his first match since December 11 after his own Bloomfield Road pitch was not suitable to play due to a frozen pitch.
Chris Baird scored two first goals while Fulham relieved some of the pressure on manager Mark Hughes with a 2-0 win at Stoke, while Blackburn fans will be happier after Nikoli Kalinic scored twice in a 3-1 win at West Brom.
Kalinic erased his copybook by being sent for a wild challenge in the second half, but it was the first victory for the new manager Steve Kean, who took over the fired Sam Allardyce.
At the beginning of Tuesday night, West Ham missed the opportunity to leave the last three when they were held 1-1 at home by Everton.
The Hammers took the lead when Tony Hibbert diverted Radoslav Kovac's cargo to his own network.
Everton leveled right before half-time through Seamus Coleman, before Carlton Cole missed a great opportunity to seal the win for the home side after the break.

"Julie was tired of living with her parents. He was 22 years old and just finished college. She started a new job in an office, and she didn't want her parents to tell her what to do more, so Julie decided to start looking for an apartment. He started by looking at classified ads in the paper and reviewing websites like Craigslist.

The first apartment he went to see sounded perfect in the paper. It was announced as a cozy one bedroom apartment with views. He made an appointment to see the apartment. When the landlord opened the door, Julie was very disappointed. The cozy bedroom barely fits a double mattress and a bedside table. The window really offered a view of a brick wall.
Julie didn't lose hope. The next apartment you saw was announced as having a renovated kitchen. Since Julie loved cooking, she imagined cooking gourmet meals in shiny new kitchen appliances. However, the corridor that showed Julie explained that the only renovations were new knobs in old wooden cabinets. Julie was starting to lose hope. He then saw a list of an apartment in the basement with access to a low maintenance yard. Julie imagined organizing barbecues for her friends until she saw that the low maintenance yard was a small slab on concrete.
Julie decided to stop looking for apartments that had characteristics she liked. Instead, he was going to look for an apartment near his job. He read a list of a studio near a highway. This meant a shorter journey. When he saw the place, he found that the studio really overlooked the highway, and traffic could be heard from the bedroom.
Julie was discouraged. She decided not to move yet.",B2

I work in a pretty traditional office setting doing a typical nine to five job. I like my job, but it's annoying that my trip to work takes an hour and a half each way and most of my work could really be done online from home. But my boss doesn't seem to trust that we're going to do any work if they leave us to our own devices, and everyone in the company has to go in and out every day. It is frustrating that they feel the need to monitor what we do so closely rather than judge ourselves on the basis of our performance of tasks, as most companies do these days.
Jo
I used to do a typical five-day week, but after leaving my maternity leave, I decided I wanted to spend more time with my kids before they started school. After negotiating with my boss, we decided to reduce my workweek to three working days. This, of course, meant a major cut in my salary as well, as I am paid pro rataly. However, since then I have realized that my workload has not diminished in the slightest. Now I'm doing five days of work in three days, but I get paid a lot less for it! I find myself having to take the work home just so I can meet the deadlines. I'm getting tired of trying to juggle about taking care of my kids and my family, but I don't dare talk about this with my boss because I think it feels like he made a big concession letting me come here just three days a week.
Marcus
I work for a global IT company, but because its headquarters is in the United States, I do all my work online from home. That means I don't waste time commuting or idle chatting with colleagues. I work on the basis of a project, and this flexibility is very valuable to me because it means that I can easily take time off when my children need me to go to their school performances or if I need to schedule an appointment with the dentist. The disadvantage is that without clear office hours, I tend to work well into the night, sometimes skipping dinner to finish a task. It can also be pretty lonely working on my own, and sometimes I miss sharing ideas with colleagues.

I'm a freelancer and I work for myself. This is great because I have control of what I do and how I spend my time. At first, I was working from home, but I found it very difficult to concentrate. There were too many distractions around: household chores I needed to do, another cup of tea, family members who wanted my attention for various things. So I started going to a café close to work, but the Wi-Fi connection was not ideal and I found myself drinking too much coffee. In the end, I decided to rent a desk in a coworking space with five other freelancers like me. I liked dressing to go to work in the morning and be able to concentrate on an office environment. Other freelancers do similar types of web-based work for me and so it's good to have coworkers to bounce ideas off too.",B2
"The small space is configured to resemble a classroom. Its corrugated iron walls are hung with educational letters – illustrated letters from the alphabet and a map of Bangladesh.
But, the constant sound of hammering and chemicals in the air that trap in the back of the throat and irritate the eyes make it difficult to concentrate. However, the children who learn in this three-square-meter room are the lucky ones. They've escaped working in factories across the street.
For 14 years, SOHAY, a grass-roots non-governmental organization funded by the Global Fund for Children and Comic Relief, has been working in slums in Dhaka to get working children to attend school. It focuses on children working in dangerous conditions: in aluminium and plastic factories and in tannery.
The classroom is one of the 23 urban development centres that SOHAY has established throughout the capital. The centres prepare children for primary school with classes that help them catch up in their education. Once they are in primary school, children can do their homework in the centers, with the help of their peers.
Ten-year-old Alamin, who worked in a plastic factory, attends one of the centers. Her father is a street vendor and her mother is a part-time domestic worker. Everyone is happy that he is now in school and away from dangerous work. His friend Rabi says he wants to forget his past at the factory. “I like school,” he says.
“Urban development centres aim to create a favourable educational environment in communities and change their cultural mindset towards children,” says SOHAY program director Mohammed Abdullah al-Mamun. SOHAY also organizes sessions for parents and employers to discourage child labour and provides training to increase family income.
“Introducing child workers into formal education is really a challenge,” says Mamun. “His psychological and physical condition is not like the other children in society. After leaving work, they sometimes find it difficult to make friends and adapt to school. It is also very difficult to make sure they stay in school – the dropout rate is very high for these children. In this context, it is important to work with schools to make them more sensitive and concerned about them.”
Zhorna Akter Sumayya, seven years old, has two older brothers, both at work (one at a restaurant and one at a local club). But, after being introduced to education in one of the SOHAY centers, now he goes to a state primary school. His family lives in the poor neighborhood and his parents cannot survive without the income their children bring home. Her father works in a rickshaw garage and her mother is a domestic worker, but they were interested in her daughter going to school.
In 2015, SOHAY helped 1,540 children leave hazardous jobs and 2,125 vulnerable children – those at risk of entering work – at school. Some 780 more children are preparing to enter school in 2017. The organization is also helping 635 children working in hazardous conditions to know their rights under the Bangladesh Code of Conduct for the Elimination of Child Labour 2010. The policy aims to eradicate all forms of child labour by 2015, but this goal has not been achieved.
Bangladesh ' s Labour Act 2006 prohibits children under the age of 14, but according to the UN Children ' s Agency, UNICEF, 4.7 million children under the age of 14 work in the informal sector and 1.3 million children between the ages of 5 and 17 work in hazardous industries.
“It was difficult to take them to school without any compensation for their time,” says Sadia Nasrin, who runs Sonjag, another grassroots NGO in Dhaka. “To overcome this challenge, Sonjag began working closely with the community in the slums where children live.”
The organization talked to community members about why it was important for children to enter school. They selected community volunteers motivated to change children's lives and formed groups with social workers, community leaders, mothers, youth volunteers and local government.
“Groups play a vital role in motivating employers to let children drop out of school for two or three hours a day and to ensure a safe workplace for children. The main agents of change are the people of the community,” says Nasrin.
He adds that people living in slums face threats of eviction, police raids and displacement. “The national plan of action for children does not recognize the needs of street children,” says Nasrin. Legislative measures are limited.
When children have lost school at the age of five, it is a race against time to prevent them from growing up without education. “After crossing school age, it’s really very difficult to admit them to school,” says Mamun. “Children are spending their time without education and waiting to participate in dangerous jobs. We are working to block the flow of child labour.”

"Carl Sagan was possibly the most famous American astronomer in history. He was an astronomer, scientist, author, cosmologist and television presenter. His historic show ""Cosmos"" was one of the first scientific shows to win acceptance by the general public in the United States. Sagan challenged Americans to think of their place in the universe as no other person before him. Using the scientific method, Sagan challenged long-standing beliefs about the genesis of life on earth. This has been done to the enlightened scientific community, and to the wrath of the religious community. Many of Sagan's teachings contradict the creationist belief of the beginning of life. He was also interested in the search for life beyond planet earth, and participated in the only human message sent to space destined for an alien race.

Sagan was born in Brooklyn, New York on November 9, 1934. His interest in science began at an early age. He wrote and co-wrote 20 books, and published over 600 scientific research papers. His most popular work was ""Contact"", which tells the story of the first contact with an intelligent alien species. The book was made in a 1997 film starring Jodie Foster. The book and film irritated many religious groups because of their message that humans are not alone in the universe.
Sagan obtained his bachelor's and master's degrees in physics from the University of Chicago in the 1950s. His scientific curiosity led him to develop the television series ""Cosmos"". It was one of the most watched scientific series, and has been recreated and is currently in the air. His work on the Galileo project continues today. The spacecraft is accelerating its way through infinite space today with its message of greeting to any race of beings that finds it. Sagan died at the age of 62 from complications resulting from pneumonia.

"America is known as the land of opportunity, where you could accomplish whatever you propose, no matter who you are. Thousands of people migrate to the United States every year from different parts of the world to have access to such opportunities. This is what is known as ""the American dream."" One of the many reasons America is such a big country is the diversity seen everywhere. The United States is a great melting pot of citizens of different origins.

The United States is also home to many of the best colleges and universities in the world. The California Institute of Technology is a world-class university that focuses heavily on science and engineering. It is located in the city of Pasadena. Harvard University is another world-class university you might be familiar with. The Harvard buildings date back to 1636, making Harvard the oldest university in the United States. It is located in the state of Massachusetts. University of California, Los Angeles is another recognized institute. Located next to Hollywood, UCLA has distinguished itself as a prestigious and selective university due to the number of people applying for admission across the United States. The above-mentioned universities are just some of the many other excellent schools that make America so outstanding.
America is also known for being at the forefront of freedom and equality. Although our history may be contradictory to these ideals, we have progressed and now live in a land of equal opportunity. Whether you want to become a doctor, lawyer, or librarian, America is the best place to be in achieving these dreams.",B2
"The worst secret kept in Formula 1 is finally out, Fernando Alonso leaves Ferrari and will be replaced by Sebastian Vettel.
Red Bull's four-time world champion has signed a three-year contract with Scuderia, F1's oldest team, starting in 2015.
After finishing his five-year period in Ferrari, Alonso remains shy where he will drive next season.
The double movement of two of the world's high-profile sports champions is the most significant in this season's driver market.
But in the fickle world of F1 there is no guarantee that it will work for any of the ambitious runners.
There are still seats to fill in McLaren, Force India and Toro Rosso. With the curtain about to fall in the 2014 season in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Sunday, hopeful drivers only have one more chance to bet on the remaining seats.
Where's Alonso going?
Alonso is considered to be the best driver of the entire route today at the elite level of motor racing, a fact that many of his companions are even happy to recognize.
The Spanish, the world's double champion with Renault in 2005 and 2006, is considered the key to the F1 driver market.
The 33-year-old made it clear that he wanted to leave Ferrari, although he had two years left to run in his contract with the Italian team, but he has not yet confirmed where he will go next.
A return to McLaren seems very likely, despite his bitter departure from the team after a single season as a teammate of Lewis Hamilton in 2007.
McLaren is about to embark on a new phase after restarting its relationship with the Honda engine manufacturer.
Alonso is expected to lead this new era in McLaren, although the fiercely ambitious driver may first want assurances that the Honda engine will be a success.
Keeping the media guessing about their future -- and perhaps also their future employers -- seems to have provided Alonso with a lot of off-track sport.
Speculation in the media has seen Alonso linked to the purchase of the Lotus team, joining forces with German specialists in Audi sports cars and even evicting Nico Rosberg or Hamilton in Mercedes.
Alonso remained typically tight about his future plans when he was interrogated by the media at the end of the Abu Dhabi season.
Has Vettel made the right decision?
Vettel has endured his worst season at Red Bull in 2014, failing to win a race compared to three wins for his novice team-mate Daniel Ricciardo.
Since his full season debut with Toro Rosso in 2008, the German has won at least one race a year, not to mention winning four consecutive world championships between 2010 and 2013.
The 27-year-old now hopes to succeed where Alonso failed in Ferrari by adding to his collection of world titles.
The next stage of my Formula 1 career will be spent with Ferrari and for me that means that the dream of a life has come true, Vettel said.
When I was a kid, Michael Schumacher in the red car was my biggest idol and now it's an incredible honor to have the chance to drive a Ferrari.
I'm very motivated to help the team get back to the top. I'll put my heart and soul into making it happen.
Vettel will partner with Kimi Raikkonen, the last man to win a world title with Ferrari in 2007, but there is no guarantee that the car and its Ferrari engine will be any match for the power of Mercedes.
Who's driving for McLaren?
McLaren has tried to dampen speculation about who will be in their cars in 2015 in the accumulation of this weekend's end-of-season race.
We know you're expecting news from our driver alignment. We'll announce it after December 1. They'll hear it here first, the team said on Twitter.
Alonso is still the hot-red favorite to take one of the seats, but the future of the current drivers Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen remains unclear.
Button, the 2009 world champion with Brawn Grand Prix, who has since become Mercedes, has remained optimistic about his future and has even explored the idea of moving on to sports car racing.
Danish rookie Magnussen is fiercely passionate about staying with McLaren, the team that gave the 22-year-old his F1 debut in 2014.
There is no Plan B, the Danish told CNN when asked if he had explored his options if he was not held back by the eight-time world champions.
What other teams have seats to fill?
Mercedes, Red Bull, Ferrari, Williams, Lotus and Sauber have confirmed their pilot pairs for 2015. There are still seats in McLaren, Force India and Toro Rosso.
Force India has already announced that it will keep the German Nico Hulkenberg by 2015, but Mexican Sergio Pérez has not confirmed his position with the team.
There is also a single seat for sale in Toro Rosso, which blooded 17-year-old Max Verstappen as the youngest F1 driver in history next season.
Red Bull Junior driver Carlos Sainz Jr is in pole position for the second seat -- and the Spaniard has been named as a test driver for Red Bull at the end of the season test in Abu Dhabi -- although Toro Rosso can still retain French driver Jean-Eric Vergne.
Sauber announced Swede Marcus Ericsson and Felipe Nasr as his 2015 pilots in November, to the great displeasure of the current driver Adrian Sutil, who believed he had a contract with the team for the next season.
Ericsson and Nasr are payment pilots, backed by sponsors who provide an estimated $30 million funding to the Swiss team.
Is the grid reduced to 18 in 2015?
The F1 market may be flooded with a lot of anxious runners, but the number of seats has been tightened.
Financial pressures on Caterham and Marussia teams, which entered the administration in October, mean, in theory, that there are only 18 points in the F1 network in 2015.
After missing the Great United States and Brazil Prix, Caterham has used crowdfunding to help fund a return in Abu Dhabi.
Japanese Kamui Kobayashi retained his driving while the team has also given British and former Will Stevens his F1 debut.
Both Caterham and Marussia remain on the official entry list for the 2015 season, but their future depends on a harsh winter getting funding to stay in the sport.
With teams spending a minimum of $70m per season, employing a driver who offers pace, performance and a pot of personal talent is more important than ever for those teams to not afford super-talented like Alonso.

"The largest boxer in the modern era is Muhammad Ali. There is usually no doubt about this in boxing circles. However, some would argue that there were others who were just as great. Ali was born in Louisville, Kentucky, and was first named Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr., but changed his name in the late 1960s after adopting Islam as his religion.

Ali was not only one of the greatest heavyweight boxers to enter the ring, but also a deeply spiritual person who challenged the U.S. government in defending its ethics. He was a controversial and divisive man who caused great emotion from those who loved him, and from those who wanted him imprisoned.
Ali was at the top of his profession in the late 1960s when his draft classification was changed. He was ordered to join the army, but refused. He claimed that he could not go to war because of his religious convictions. Many saw this U.S. government movement as a way of silencing the frank boxer because it was far beyond the age that most American youth were being recruited at the time. Ali was stripped of his title, and was banned from boxing, while his case went through the U.S. judicial system. Ali was inactive during his last years, from 25 to almost 29 years. It is not known how many more wins and titles he could have won during his stolen cousin.
Eventually, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in an 8-to-0 decision in favor of Ali, overturning his conviction for recruitment evasion. His position was not popular at the time among conservative Americans; many people disliked him very much, but his determination and moral principles defended his decision. He is now considered one of the most influential people in U.S. history. He was named ""Sportsman of the Century"" by Sports Illustrated magazine, and ""Sports Personality of the Century"" by the BBC.",B2
"The era of the great British summer music festival, including Glastonbury, is coming to an end, according to lead rock promoter and manager Harvey Goldsmith.
The man who has produced and worked with most of the largest musical stars in the Western world, from The Who, the Rolling Stones and Queen to Madonna, Bob Dylan and Luciano Pavarotti, said the biggest problem was the lack of large new bands to succeed the old ones.
“The festival circuit has reached its peak,” he said, speaking at the Hay Festival of Literature and Arts in Powys, Wales. “It really peaked about two years ago. There are too many of them and there are not enough great acts to lead them. That's a big, big problem in our industry. And we are not producing a new generation of such acts, such as the Rolling Stones, Muse, not even the Arctic Monkeys, which they can headline.”
There were about 900 music festival events in the UK between May and September 2014, he said, and there is no way everyone can continue. “Musical festivals have probably followed their course. What is going to happen is a growth in events where it is not just music but, like this one, with poetry or books or magic shows. There will be a lot of small combined festivals that give something more, not people standing in a large massive field unable to go to the bathroom because they could miss the band.”
Clearly, the way the music is being delivered has changed, he said. “People don’t seem to want to hear a body of work anymore, an album. And, most rock bands built a reputation in a body of work – they could take three albums to really perfect their art, to become great, but young people don't want that. They arrive on a track, a sound, then, ping, again to the next. Pop penetrates, not that there's anything wrong with pop. I think it'll happen again, but it'll take time.
Goldsmith, 69, also revealed that he has partnered with Robin de Levita, the Dutch rock producer Tommy of Who’s 1970, in a new 1,100-seat theater in Wembley, which is about to finish in time for the first stage adaptation of the phenomenally successful series of teen films and books The Hunger Games in June 2016.
From Levita, Goldsmith said, he would take his experimental concept of SceneAround to London – theatre that places the audience sitting on a rotating table that revolves around a series of scenes built around its circumference, accompanied by projections on panel screens. The concept was a pioneer in an airplane hangar outside Amsterdam and has been a great success.
Goldsmith, who is already planning to take a production of Anne Frank’s story to the nameless place, said, “It’s a completely different way to produce shows.”
During his appearance in Hay, the businessman also revealed some of the secrets of “access to all areas” of his long career in the music industry, talking about Keith Moon putting dynamite in a toilet in Sydney’s hotel room in an effort to unlock it and witness the paralyzing stage scare that gripped John Lennon just before an appearance at Madison Square Garden in 1974 and led him to be dragged, vomited, out of his dressing room and pushed onto the stage. “It’s the strangest thing, really, how common that is among artists. It’s strange what’s affected by the fear they’re going to put on, but as soon as they hit the first chord, they’re fine,” he said.
He also put to rest a long-lasting rock and roll mystery: why Elvis Presley never acted outside North America. Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker, admitted to him during tea, said the real reason Goldsmith tried to take the singer to London had failed was Parker's uncertain immigration status.
“He explained that it was because he was an illegal Dutch immigrant. He didn’t want to risk leaving the United States, it was him, not Elvis,” Goldsmith said.
So, your best rock and roll artist? “Freddie Mercury had to be our most powerful stage actor, the best live actor we ever had. On Live Aid, she went out and saw that audience and grabbed it.”
But the next Queen was still far from being formed, she said. “We are not producing a new generation of such acts. Coldplay is probably the last one to show up and that was ten years ago. There's not much out there that seems to be forming the next generation of heritage artists.
“So, without great acts for headline, there are no great shows. Glastonbury has reached the point where he can't find any bigger acts and that's the pinnacle of festivals. They’re really done.”

"The chart illustrates trends in music buying habits between 2011 and 2018. It presents three different methods: streaming, downloading and buying CDs.
In general, both downloads and physical music sales have steadily decreased. The latter has plummeted since 2011, while the decline for the first began in 2014. However, there has been a sharp increase in people broadcasting music since 2013.
In 2011, most music sales were from CDs, with 55% of all sales. On the contrary, streaming was not at all common at only 5%. In addition, although people had started downloading music, it represented only 35% of sales. As CD sales began to fall, downloads began to increase. They rose constantly and the discharges exceeded physical sales in mid-2013. During the same period, transmission doubled to 10%, but then began to grow more dramatically.
The downloads reached their peak in 2014 in about 43% of sales, but fell to 30% in 2018. This was slightly higher than physical sales, which were reduced to 25%. On the other hand, Streaming surpassed both and accounted for just over 40% of sales in 2018.",B2
"Fashion during the recession
Current economic trends offer an opportunity
so that many people look at fashion in a way
They haven't done it before.
Many consumers are looking for fashion that is
not only affordable, but stylish as well. Okay.
to some fashion experts, this has forced
designers and retailers to lose excess fluff
and return to the meat and potatoes of your
lines and offerings. That can mean clothes with
better fit and designs that are more in tune
with its target markets, says Amanda Lovell,
Department of Fashion Design in El Arte
New York City Institute.
“By doing less and offering less, there is a
greater concentration in the production of articles that are
known vendors,” says Lovell. “Designers and
retailers need to make the most of each
buys a customer does, because of the fact
that customers are thinking twice before buying
excess parts.”
Every fashion brand, designer and retailer has
articles that are known sellers, Lovell explains. “For
example, the Gap probably sells its short sleeves Crewneck or V-neck, black T-shirts
for men and women season after season
regardless of the economy or the forces in the trend
cycle”, it offers.
Designers have also responded by offering
lower priced bridge lines, adds Mary Hall,

“There are fewer and fewer high-end collections
with the high prices that come out,” says Hall, a
Angel marketing manager. “Now we have
Norma Kamali in Walmart, Vera Wang and
Dana Buchman in Kohl, and the annual H&M
designers. Makes fashion a lot more
accessible to consumers”.
And as fashion focuses on getting more bang for
the male, the buyers are in search of versatile
clothing items that have a long service life.
“We all got a little wiser and started
exercise the power of the purse,” says Hall.
“We’re buying smarter. The New Differentiator
is the value along with the best price.”
Lovell agrees. “I believe from the consumer’s point of view
view, they're looking for pieces to add to their
cabinets that will take you further and will have
more power of permanence,” she offers. “Classic pieces
have been trending well.”
To keep them up to date, many
Designers give them a little newer twist.
“Pets like the basic cardigan are getting
a facelift with additional specks and trimmings, and
simple touches on the update of buttons, or the
cut,” says Lovell. “This is an example of
classic piece that women can use and depend on
throughout the year. I see customers buying these
pieces that can be worn out the most.”
Classic items are not the only popular things in the
in the economy. Many second-hand stores are seeing a
increase sales. According to a survey of members by
the National Association of Resale and Exploitation Stores,
little more than 64% of shops had an average
sales increase of 31%.
Lovell also says there's a resurgence of people
mending your clothes and accessories before
replace them with new elements. “For example,
shoe repair workshops have noticed an increase in
business, as consumers bring in their shoes to be
repaired instead of buying a new pair,”
She explains it.
“In general, trends in consumer purchasing behaviours
change with what is happening socially, politically,
and economically in the world. Fashion
the industry only has to endure this wave and
consumers will soon be spending too much, as
before,” Lovell says.
However, some say that the recession has caused
to be more responsible in their
spending habits – a change that could be
permanent for many consumers.",B2
"Ryan Braun must now sit at home ashamed. If the press reports are accurate, Alex Rodriguez and a dozen other major league cheaters could do that, too. But the houses you sit in are $1 million mansions. That seems to be the lesson young athletes learn from the latest steroid scandal.
Sure, they look bad. But both Braun and Rodriguez have millions of dollars to fall back. The most worrying thing about this issue is how many of today's youth believe that cheating could be the only way to break up in sports.
In a recent Zogby survey, nearly half of men aged 18 to 25 thought that taking performance-enhancing drugs is critical to doing so in professional sports or helping their athletic performance. And more than half of the respondents thought that at least a third of the major league players in the recent All-Star Game had used performance-enhancing drugs, often called PEDs, to get to where they are.
The problem is that, for every Braun and A-Rod, a thousand young people will never reach older ones, but they are willing to risk their health, even their lives, taking PEDs. These young athletes need to hear more about Taylor Hooton than Ryan Braun.
Taylor Hooton was a high school star pitcher who turned to steroids to reach the next level. Although steroids filled his body, they wreaked havoc on his emotions until one day he hanged himself. His father, Don Hooton, has committed his life to trying to help other young athletes stay away from steroids.
Tragic decisions come when you combine motive with opportunity. That's what we have here. Young athletes see athletes squeezed into a series of sports get fame and glory and multimillion dollar contracts. They want to be like them. You can go online and find dozens of websites that offer to sell anabolic steroids and other PEDs online.
You don't have to find a gloomy figure lurking in a corner in a long coat. Teenagers know how to find just what they think they need on YouTube, eBay, and other websites that parents haven't even heard of. But these children know nothing about the dangers of even the purest of steroids, not to mention those that are contaminated with dangerous substances. The Taylor Hooton Foundation has found PEDs containing pollutants such as lead and other heavy metals, liquid mixers such as cooking oil, horse urine and other dirty contents.
What can parents do to keep their children safe?
Pay attention to sudden fluctuations in weight and muscle growth. If your child suddenly accumulates, it may be cause for concern. Also, pay attention to an extreme change in personality. Teenagers are prone to mood swings, but if your teen athlete is suddenly filled with unexplained anger, talk to him or her about what may be causing extreme emotions.
It is also important to pay attention to the use of the Internet and credit cards. Many teens have credit cards, which can be easily used to purchase PEDs online. Recently, the group of consumers I led, Digital Citizens Alliance, made four purchases online, and illegal drugs arrived in just under a month.
Talk to your teens regularly about why they shouldn't use PEDs. Using them is cheating, they are illegal to own without a prescription, and they can do serious harm to teens and their minds. It is a sad fact that if you play high school or college sports, these young people probably already know about someone who has taken PEDs. Don't assume it's someone else's problem.
Most importantly, do not ignore warning signs, even if it leads to a difficult conversation. Make sure young athletes listen to the whole story.
Most of the media coverage around the MLB scandal is whether the use of PED is worth the risk of millions of dollars in lost wages and the shame that it entails being caught. But the real risk to young athletes is their health. Young athletes who appear to be our best health condition may be facing decades of health problems - including liver abnormalities and tumors, increased risk of heart attacks, depression, and more - from taking PEDs.
Make sure for every story about A-Rod, they find out about Taylor Hooton. Let them know that fame and money -- and the risk of shame -- are not really at stake here. When they use PEDs, they're risking their lives and their health. And that's never worth the risk.

"Martin Luther King Jr. is one of the most famous Americans in history. He was a pastor and humanitarian, but he is known mainly for being a civil rights activist. King was the leader of the African American Civil Rights Movement during the 1950s and 1960s. Their use of nonviolent protest to affect social change was based on their Christian beliefs. King was born Michael King, but his father changed his name in honor of the German reformer, Martin Luther.

King lived during the most divisive era in American history. White and southern culture in the United States wanted nothing to do with social change during the 1960s. There were segregation laws that prohibited Black Americans from eating in the same restaurants as whites, or traveling in the same section on public buses with white Americans. King led the famous Montgomery 1955 Bus Boycott in reaction to Rosa Park's refusal to deliver his bus seat to a white passenger as required by law in Montgomery, Alabama at that time.
King began his activism while serving as Baptist minister of the Baptist church on Dexter Avenue. He firmly believed in the Christian belief that loving your neighbor as yourself, which was a philosophy he used throughout his years of civil rights. He was also a great speaker. His speech ""I Have a Dream"" is considered one of the most famous oratorios in American history. In it, he talks about how his dream is for black and white Americans to walk hand in hand as brothers. The speech also stated how his dream was that all Americans would be judged, not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.
On 14 October 1964, King received the Nobel Peace Prize for his participation in the fight against racial inequality in the United States. He was murdered in April 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee, at the age of 39.",B2
"Fernando TorresA long-awaited change to English champions Chelsea was completed just before Monday's transfer window was closed in an agreement that his former Liverpool team said had broken the British record.
Chelsea's website reported that the Spanish striker had signed a five-and-a-half-year contract, but did not disclose the rate -- that British media speculated it would be about 50 million LRB-$80 million -RRB-.
However, it was still well below the $130 million world record that Real Madrid of Spain paid the English Manchester United club for Cristiano Ronaldo in 2009.
In another agreement confirmed at the end of Monday, Benfica said Brazil's defender, David Luiz, had joined Chelsea in an agreement worth $34 million that saw the signing of Serbian midfielder Nemanja Matic for the Portuguese club.
I am very happy with my move to Chelsea and I am looking forward to helping my new teammates this season and for many years to come, the 2010 Torres World Cup winner told the London side website.
Having played Chelsea many times since he came to England, and in some very big games I will never forget, I know there are many great players here and I will work hard to win a place on the team. I hope I can score some important goals for fans to enjoy this season.
The 26-year-old scored 65 goals in 102 Premier League games for Liverpool after joining Atlético Madrid in 2007 in an agreement #20 million, adding 81 in 142 matches in all competitions.
Torresmove followed the news that Liverpool had agreed to a club record quota for Newcastle English striker Andy Carroll, who delivered a transfer request in the afternoon after the 18-time English champions made an improved offer.
Just before the deadline of 2300 GMT, Liverpool confirmed that the 22-year-old had signed a contract until 2016. The quota was not disclosed, but supposedly exceeded the previous British record of 33 million - LRB- 53 million -RRB- that Manchester City paid for Brazilian Robinho in 2008.
Is it going to be time-day against the trend?
Chelsea's billionaire owner, Roman Abramovich, has been relatively calm in the transfer market over the past two seasons, but this time he has backed coach Carlo Ancelotti with two brand firms like his fourth languishing club on the table -- 10 points behind Manchester United leaders.
The London team also announced on Monday that Chelsea FC plc made a loss of #70.9 million - LRB-$113 million -RRB- for the year ended 30 June 2010.
The reduction in operating losses and the increase in sales in 2009-10 shows that we are moving in the right direction, especially when looking at the difficult macroeconomic environment, said Ron Gourlay CEO of Chelsea’s website.
The club is in a strong position to address the challenges of UEFA's financial initiatives that will be relevant to the financial statements to be published in early 2013.
Latest Twitter transfer rumors
Carroll joined Uruguay World Cup striker Luis Suárez in Liverpool, with the 24-year-old completing his transfer of $36 million from the Dutch club Ajax on Monday to become Kenny Dalglish's first majority signing in second place as manager.
The 24 year old has scored 111 goals in 159 games for the Amsterdam team.
Another high-profile striker on the move on Monday was Robbie Keane of Tottenham, who has agreed to a loan change to London's West Ham rivals until the end of this season.
It is likely that the movement will become permanent if the Hammers, currently at the bottom of the EPL, prevent the descent to the second flight.
Blog: Who will be the best signature in the transfer window?
Manager Avram Grant said after the FA 3-2 Cup won Nottingham Forest that he hoped the Republic of Ireland international would provide the spark to drive the club away from the fall zone.
He's not just a good player, he's a good character we need in the next 14 games, the Israeli told the UK Press Association.
Tottenham, who faces AC Milan in the last 16 of the Champions League next month, was linked to an offer for Atlético de Madrid Sergio Aguero.
But the Argentine striker has signed a further extension of the two-and-a-half-year contract with the Spanish side until 2014 and told the official La Liga team website: I stay here because I want to.
Spurs manager Harry Redknapp did not confirm his interest in Aguero or other targets reported in Spain when he arrived for Monday's training session, but told Sky Sports that former England defender Jonathan Woodgate would not go on loan.

"Born in the small town of Tupelo, Mississippi, Elvis Aaron Presley grew up in poverty. His working-class parents moved frequently throughout the state, going from work to work. Presley grew up to be one of the most recognizable and famous American celebrities the country has ever known. He recorded countless albums, starred in the big screen, and his songs were heard on the radio by more fans than any other artist in history.

Presley received his first guitar at the age of 10, and soon began a musical career that would last more than 25 years. His first success was winning a high school talent contest in Memphis, Tennessee, while he was still in school. Shortly after graduation, Presley was discovered by Sam Phillips, owner of a record company. His first commercial success came in 1954 with his successful single that is fine. Much of Presley's success could be attributed to his unconventional dance, and to his live acting style. Her hip movements and sexually suggestive movements won Presley much praise and controversy.
In 1956, Presley recorded his first No. 1 hit Heartbreak Hotel, and its first No. 1 album, self-titled Elvis Presley. He also signed a contract with Paramount Pictures Studios, which was, and remains, one of the largest Hollywood studios in the industry. He starred in several films with Paramount. In 1957, Presley was recruited into service by the United States Army, where he served abroad. His time in the army didn't hurt his career. Shortly after his service ended in 1960, Presley began recording music and starring in films.
Presley married in 1967, and had a daughter the following year. Unfortunately, his marriage ended in divorce in 1973. He fell into prescription drug abuse, and got into a lot of weight. He died in August 1977, due to complications of his drug abuse. It remains one of the most profitable artists in the world today.",B2

"The Duchess of Cambridge gave birth to a son on Monday, July 22. Third in line to the throne, the baby is destined to be monarch number 43 since William the Conqueror obtained the English crown in 1066.
Kensington Palace announced at 8.30 p.m. that the baby was born at 4.24 p.m. at the exclusive Lindo Wing in St Mary’s Hospital, Paddington, West London. “We couldn’t be happier,” said the Duke of Cambridge.
In a statement, Kensington Palace said: “His Royal Highness the Duchess of Cambridge was delivered safely from a son at 4:24 p.m. The baby weighs 8 pounds 6oz. The Duke of Cambridge was present for birth.” The Duchess experienced at least ten and a half hours of work, which Kensington Palace said had “progressed as usual.”
The Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Harry and members of both families were informed and delighted with the news that His Royal Highness and his son were well.
It is understood that the couple delayed the announcement immediately so that they could enjoy some private time with their newborn. William telephoned his family to give them the good news, talking to the Queen, her father, Charles and her younger brother, Prince Harry.
The birth of the little prince means that the monarchy has three generations of heirs to the throne for the first time since 1894.
The baby is the first Prince of Cambridge to be born for more than 190 years since Prince George of Cambridge, a grandson of George III and the only son of Prince Adolf Frederick, the first Duke of Cambridge.
In a statement, Prince Charles said: “Both my wife and I are delighted with the arrival of my first grandson. It's an incredibly special time for William and Catherine and we're very excited about them at the birth of their baby.
“Paternity is a unique moment in anyone’s life, as countless kind people have told me in recent months, so I am enormously proud and happy to be a grandfather for the first time and we are eager to see the baby in the near future.”
The new royalty will be named H.H. Prince George of Cambridge. When Kate was three months pregnant, a decree issued by the Queen said: “All children of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales must have and enjoy the style, title and attribute of the Royal Highness with the titular dignity of Prince or Princess prefixes their Christian names or those other titles of honor.”
Following tradition, a formal notice was published on an ornate rococo-style easel, which was used to announce the birth of Prince William in 1982, in the front yard of Buckingham Palace shortly before 9:00 p.m. Within an hour, the number had increased from hundreds to thousands outside the palace, with locals and tourists alike eager to share the historical moment.
New Yorker Sharon Surloff was delighted with her photo of the real newsletter phone, which broke after she and her niece and mother had squeezed into the crowd to take a picture of the easel.
“The police were saying to everyone, ‘OK, 20 seconds and then the next person.’ It's just great to be here, though. We arrived this morning, at nine in the morning, so everything worked out very well.”
The palace announced the birth in a press release. Minutes later, while the crowd of well-desired outside cheered, “It’s a child,” the formal medical bulletin was taken from the hospital to a waiting car by Prince William’s press secretary Ed Perkins. He handed it over to a soldier, who then took notice, who was signed by Marcus Setchell, the Queen's gynecologist, to Buckingham Palace under police escort.
The Prime Minister was one of the first to congratulate him. Speaking on the outskirts of 10 Downing Street, David Cameron said: “It’s wonderful news from St Mary’s, Paddington, and I’m sure that, across the country, and indeed across the Commonwealth, people will be celebrating and wishing the best for the real couple.
“It’s an important moment in our nation’s life but, I guess, above all, it’s a wonderful time for a warm and loving couple who have a new baby. It has been remarkable years for our royal family: a royal wedding that captured the hearts of the people, that extraordinary and magnificent jubilee and now this royal birth – all from a family that has given this nation such incredible service.”
Congratulations also came from the White House, Barack Obama and his wife. The president said: “Michelle and I are very happy to congratulate the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on the joyful occasion of the birth of their first son. We wish you all the happiness and blessings that paternity brings.”
The Archbishop of Canterbury, the most Reverend Justin Welby, tweeted: “Delighted for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. May God bless you all with love, health and happiness.”
Labour leader Ed Miliband said: “Many congratulations to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. I wish them and their child all happiness and good health.”
The campaign group, Republic, which launched its Born Equal initiative calling for all children to be born equal in political status and rights, said that real birth raised questions about Britain and democratic values. Chief Executive Graham Smith said the baby should be able to grow without “constant interference and intrusion.” He said: “Here is a new baby whose career, religion, even personal relationships have already been traced. In the meantime, this is an opportunity for the rest of us to consider whether this circus is the best way to run things.”

"It was Tuesday rush hour, and Dorothy Otto was sitting in traffic at her Pontiac Bonneville on the lower level of the Cypress Highway in Oakland, California, when the voice on the radio said, ""We're having an earthquake.
Suddenly, the concrete around her began to wave.
There was a giant accident, and a big heavy beam fell on the front of his car, crushing the engine, barely missing his face. The car fell 20 feet, and when it settled, Otto's left foot was trapped.
The two-story highway had collapsed, driving motorists into their cars.
Otto found a pen and decided to write a note to her husband, just in case.
Jack, the earthquake hit while I was under concrete, the worst happened, he wrote. It collapsed in the car. I'm alive, only my left foot is stuck under the car. I hope they don't kill me to get me out. I love you so much, good luck to both of you.
Fireman Lorenzo Frediani was running out of time as he struggled to free Otto's foot and put it to safety. Each replica lowered the top deck, approaching it to crush Otto and Frediani. So Frediani was able to push the crushed dashboard enough. Otto was free.
His section of the Cypress collapsed 20 minutes later.
That was October 17, 1989. The 6.9 magnitude earthquake, now called Loma Prieta, killed 63 people, 42 of them on the Cypress Highway. The earthquake caused damage of $10 billion, ultimately inspiring California and the rest of the region to re-examine their earthquake security measures.
Near Oregon it is located on a huge line of faults separating two of the Earth's tectonic plates. A plaque is located below the Pacific Ocean, off the Oregon coast, and is being pushed under the North American continent, according to Ian Madin, geologist and chief scientist of the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries.
Is the earthquakes on the rise?
The fault line, known as the Cascadia Subduction Zone, could cause an even greater earthquake.
As the two plates collide, says Madin, the failure gets stuck, eventually slipping when enough stress accumulates to produce a big earthquake.
With an ultra-exact GPS, Madin says scientists know that the collision continues to occur because they can measure motion. Oregon actually moves around 1Â 1/2 inches each year, typical of a region near a subduction zone.
These mega earthquakes can cause strong tremors over large areas for several minutes. They can also lead to landslides, tsunamis, and widespread liquefaction, turning the soil into soup.
After the deadly 9.0 magnitude earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan in March 2011, Oregon lawmakers commissioned a study on the impact a comparable earthquake could have on the state. Madin was one of the authors of the Oregon Resilience Plan, which aims to reduce risk and improve recovery for the upcoming Cascadia earthquake and tsunami.
Oregon is not ready for a mega earthquake, and few areas are, says Madin. He says Japan is the most prepared, and look at the results of his mega-earthquake. The 2011 earthquake and tsunami caused more than 15,000 deaths.
Prior to 1974, there were no specific construction requirements in Oregon to ensure that structures were built to withstand major earthquakes, and design codes have only been suitable for the mega earthquake since 1993, so many structures are not designed to withstand such a large earthquake, Madin says.
Rapid events of the earthquake
In addition, we have a lot of mountainous terrain that is highly susceptible to landslides, large areas that are susceptible to liquefaction, and 300 miles of coastline that will be flooded by tsunamis that will arrive within 15 to 20 minutes of the earthquake and can locally reach 100-foot elevations above sea level, he says.
It is these factors that led the Oregon Resilience Plan to conclude that in the worst case scenario, 10,000 people could be killed, and large areas of Oregon could be without transportation, electricity, water and sewerage for several months to several years. The damage could result in an economic loss of $30 billion. Madin says $30 billion is almost certain to be understated, and death estimates might also be out.
Based on the study of geological characteristics that record prehistoric earthquakes, scientists generally agree that there have been 42 mega earthquakes along the Cascadia fault in the last 10,000 years, with the most recent in January 1700.
Using historical data, scientists such as Dr. Chris Goldfinger, marine geologist and professor at Oregon State University, can predict the probability of another major earthquake.
The Cascadia Subduction Zone is actually composed of different clusters, according to Goldfinger. At the southern end of the fault, data show that every 250 years an earthquake occurs with a magnitude between the high sevens and the low eights.
We are 300 years in a 240-year cycle, says Goldfinger.
On the other hand, the northern end, with large population centers, sees a great event closer to every 500 years.
But before the Oregonans panic, consider Goldfinger's assessment of statistics. For the southern end of Cascadia, there is approximately 35-40% chance of having a major earthquake in the next 50 years. At the northern end, there is only a probability of 10-15 %.
Even if there's still a lot of time before the next big earthquake, there's a lot of work to do to make sure Oregon's ready.
The most important thing is to strengthen or replace the infrastructure to ensure that our lifeguard systems such as energy and water are not so damaged that it takes years to repair them. We also need to strengthen or replace critical facilities such as hospitals, police and fire facilities and schools, says Madin.
Following the publication of the Oregon Resilience Plan, the Oregon Legislature established a working group to present specific recommendations for action at the 2015 legislative session.
Oregon has already turned the corner because the institutions are no longer asking, why should I do anything to prepare and now they are asking, how do I pay for the preparation I know I need?

"The second Monday of October is celebrated Columbus Day in the United States and in other countries around the world. For a long time it was observed on a specific date, October 12. It bears the name of Christopher Columbus, the Italian sailor who led three Spanish ships to reclaim new lands in 1492. There's even a poem about a child remembering the date. It says, ""In 1492, Columbus sailed through the blue ocean."" Some people say that Columbus ""discovered"" North America, although not everyone agrees with this interpretation. For example, Columbus never came to North America properly. It only reached the islands of the Caribbean Sea.

Columbus Day has been a federal holiday since 1937; government offices, schools and post offices are closed. Many Italians take the day as a day to celebrate their own ethnic heritage since Columbus was born in Genoa, Italy. Columbus' explorations, however, took place on behalf of Spain. Major cities, such as New York and San Francisco, host large parades. Some cities, such as New York City, also hold a parade to celebrate the Hispanic or Latino community.
Not everyone thinks Christopher Columbus should be honored. Some states like South Dakota don't watch vacations at all. Instead, they call Native American Day or Indigenous Peoples Day. In Hawaii holidays are also known as Landing Day or Discovery Day. This is because the arrival of Europeans in North America meant the loss of land and lives for many indigenous people. Many people hold protests or vigils on this day to remind Native Americans that they were killed or enslaved as a result of the arrival of Europe. Another name for the party is ""Dia de la Raza"", which is translated into English as Carrera Day.",B2
"Johnny Carson served as host of the iconic night television series The Tonight Show for 30 years. During that time, Carson entertained generations of American viewers with his realistic style, casual focus, and quick-minded humor. The Tonight Show was already a great success when Carson took over from retired Jack Paar, but Carson took the show to the next level. His style, and grace on camera, has been imitated by many evening talk show hosts, who have credited Carson as their mentor.

Carson was born thousands of miles from the brightness of New York City, and Los Angeles, in Corning, Iowa, in 1925. Carson began his entertainment career at the age of 14 when he appeared at the county fairs as a magician, which was his first love. His family moved to the state of Nebraska when Carson was a young man, and served as a communications officer for the United States Navy during the end of World War II. His career in broadcasting began in 1950 in Omaha, Nebraska, before moving to Los Angeles, and getting a job at a local television station.
Carson officially became host of The Tonight Show on October 1, 1962. The show was based in New York City until 1972, when, at Carson's request, it moved permanently to the Los Angeles area. Carson organized his show in Burbank for the next 21 years, where he perfected his style and approach to his guests. It was considered an honor to be invited to The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson.
Carson was a real artist. During his reign he made many sketches, where he dressed up in disguise, and played ridiculous characters, which is something that the night hosts today do not do. Carson was never afraid to laugh at himself.",B2
"Dear Professor Henley,
I am writing to inform you that, unfortunately, I cannot continue to attend Logic II this semester. I would like to request permission to postpone, as I understand that this is only possible with your approval.
The problem is that I am currently doing an internship with ABC Ltd. It started in July and will continue until the end of the semester. The internship lasts 25 hours a week and I'm worried you won't leave me enough time to study. I've already asked if I can reduce my hours there, but this is not possible.
With your approval, I could take Logic II next semester instead. I realize that this would mean a heavier workload than usual next semester, but I assure you that I will be able to manage my time and keep up with it.
Thank you for considering my request and I would be pleased to enter and discuss the matter further.

"Being controversial is a right that every American has, and William 'Bill' Maher uses that right as much as anyone else in the country. Maher is an actor, comedian, political satirical and talk show host. He was born in New York in 1958 in a Roman Catholic family, but today he calls himself agnostic. One of the first cases in which Maher questioned Catholicism was when his father stopped taking it to him and his sister when he was 13. He discovered that his father was angry with the church because of his stance against birth control. His father has become a frank person against all religions organized since then.

Maher is currently hosting the HBO ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" program. It is a highly valued show, at night that has received many Emmy nominations for excellence. It's a controversial show where emotions run high between Maher and his guests. Maher says what he thinks, and this has been a source of trouble over the years, but he has also deserved praise.
In 2001, Maher was criticized for his comments on the terrorist attacks against the United States in September 2001. President George W. Bush had publicly called the attackers ""cowards,"" whom Maher opposed. Maher stated on his show that the real cowards were the Americans. ""We've been the cowards,"" Maher said. ""Steal cruise missiles 2,000 miles away; that's cowardly."" He later said that he did not criticize the U.S. military, but only pointed out that the U.S. plays an important role in Middle East politics.
Maher has also made enemies among religious organizations. He says he doesn't like religion, which he calls an unnecessary bureaucracy between the people and God. He was once very liberal about all religions, but has changed his view of Islam by saying that he knows no other religion that calls for the death of anyone who criticizes his religion. He also called the Mormon church ridiculous.",B2

"Anna woke up late one morning. He was supposed to meet a group of friends that morning at 8 o'clock. He woke up at 8:15 instead. Anna hastened to prepare herself. He quickly bathed, put on his clothes. Then he grabbed his toolbox and went on his bike.

Anna and her friends were asked to paint two murals for the city library. One of the murals was to be located on the outside, and the other on the inside. The owner of the library was the one who requested these murals. The reason was because he was a fan of Anna's art, and he was planning on remodeling the library.
Both murals were to be painted with a similar theme. Both were to be paintings intended to inspire people to read. Anna had already planned her ideas for both murals. It was going to be colorful. His friends were going to be there to help paint the large areas of the mural.
Once Anna arrived, she noticed her friends waiting outside the library. Anna apologized for being late. He took out his ideas to show them to his friends. His friends were impressed and excited to start painting. They began by sketching the images of ideas on both walls. Then they mixed their colors and began to paint. Painting the mural was much faster when you had the help of your friends. They finished both murals in two days.
The new murals attracted the attention of local visitors to the library. The library owner was impressed and pleased with the new look of his library. He recognized Anna and her friends and paid them for their work. Anna was happy.",B2
"Two mothers in South Africa have discovered that they are raising each other daughters after being mistakenly changed at birth in a hospital in 2010.
But while one of the women wants to correct the mistake and claim her biological son, the other refuses to return the child she has raised as her own, which poses a huge legal dilemma.
Henk Strydom, a lawyer for one of the mothers, who cannot be identified due to a court order, described the inadvertent exchange as a parody and tragedy that is unlikely to have a happy ending.
Both mothers gave birth at Tambo Memorial Hospital in Boksburg, east of Johannesburg, on the same day in 2010. “No one suspected anything,” Strydom said.
But in 2013, one of the mothers, who is 33 years old and unemployed, sued her ex-partner for the maintenance of her daughter. Strydom continued: “The man denied that he was the father. He ran a DNA test and found that it wasn't his baby and not his baby. I was devastated. She didn’t know what to do.”
Finally, she met the other mother and, since December 2013, they have attended joint counselling sessions organized by the hospital. This has included meeting her biological daughters.
Strydom said of her client: “She said there are similarities with herself. She told me it was traumatic. You can see it's not easy for her. She has to take care of a child who is not her own while her child is with someone else.”
The woman was reportedly dissatisfied with the process and went to the juvenile court in an attempt to obtain custody of her biological child, but the other mother refused. Strydom agreed to represent the woman, who has an older son, pro bono.
“It’s a tragedy. He wants the baby back, but it looks like the other mother is reluctant. It’s four years later: you can understand that she doesn’t want to give up her baby.”
The Pretoria High Court has appointed the Centre for Children ' s Law at the University of Pretoria to investigate what will now be in the best interests of children, which is the guiding principle of South African law. It must be reported within 90 days.
Strydom added: “Your guess is as good as mine what the court decides. It's a parody. How is it rectified after four years? The longer you wait, the more traumatic it will be. But no matter what happens, someone will not be happy.”
He said that at this time, he and his client do not want to sue the government's hospital or health department, which is currently helping with the case and providing advice.
The Child Law Centre will now interview mothers and fathers, as well as any other person who has a “significant relationship” with any of the girls. Children and mothers will be subjected to “full and comprehensive” clinical assessments and can be seen by a psychologist.
Karabo Ngidi, a lawyer at the center, said: “What is going to happen must be in the best interests of the children. Biology is an important aspect, but not the only one.”
The families are of Zulu ethnicity, so Zulu tradition, culture and customary law will be a factor, he added. It is also possible that the former partner of the mother taking legal action could be the biological father of the girl who was changed.
This is not the first case of children's exchange to come to light in South Africa. In 1995, two mothers received damages after their children, born in 1989, were accidentally changed at the Johannesburg hospital where they were born.
In 2009, in Oregon, in the United States, Dee Ann Angell and Kay Rene Reed discovered that they had been mistaken at birth in 1953 when a nurse brought them back from the bathroom. In 2013, in Japan, a 60-year-old man, exchanged at birth from his wealthy parents to a poor family, received compensation. He grew up in welfare and became a truck driver, while his biological brothers – and the child raised in his place – attended high schools and private universities.
Bruce Laing, a clinical psychologist in Johannesburg, said the long-term effects of a baby change could be “deep”, “terrible” and “unbelievably traumatizing.” He told The Times in South Africa: “An increasingly complicated situation is that some resentment may occur towards a child who is not his. Parents could always be thinking, ""What if? '""

"A Cleveland police officer shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice about two seconds after the officer and a partner stopped in a car to investigate reports that someone was wielding a gun in a park, surveillance video that the police posted on Wednesday shows.
Tamir, who had what the police said was an air pistol that looked like a real gun, died on Sunday, the day after he was shot outside a recreational center.
Police also released two audio recordings on Wednesday, a 911 call that preceded the shooting and a tape from a dispatcher asking officers to go to the park.
The shooting occurred after a person called 911 to report that a black man -- probably a minor -- was pointing a gun at people outside the recreation center. Twice the caller said the gun could be fake.
The dispatcher spoke over the radio to the officers about a black man pointing a gun at people, but he did not mention that caller's belief that he could be a minor and that the gun might not be a real gun, one of the footage published shows.
The police previously said it was unclear whether the responding officers received information about the age of the suspect or whether the weapon was possibly false.
Authorities are investigating the shooting, and the two officers -- identified on Wednesday by the police as Timothy Loehmann, 26, and Frank Garmack, 46 -- are out of work.
Loehmann joined the department in March, Tomba said.
Police Deputy Chief Ed Tomba noted that his department published the video at the request of Tamir's relatives, who had seen it privately with the permission of the authorities.
“We are honoring the wishes of the family,” Tomba said. This is an obvious tragic event.
In a written statement obtained by CNN affiliate WWS, the family thanked the police for making the video public.
“We believe that this situation could have been avoided and that Tamir should still be here with us,” the family said. We ask that the community remain calm. Please protest peacefully and responsibly. Your prayers, your kind words and your condolences have meant a lot to us.
Video shows official shoot Tamir
The video shows Tamir walking down a sidewalk and finally sitting on a picnic table under a gazebo on Saturday afternoon, sometimes pointing out what appears to be a gun.
Eventually, Tamir emerges from the bench and walks to the edge of the vantage point. A police car drives to the lookout, leaving the road and rolling over the snowy grass to do so.
One of the officers, the one in the passenger seat, told Tamir three times to show his hands, Tomba told the journalists.
“The officer’s door was open as they stopped,” Tomba said. He screamed three times as they stopped.
The eight-minute surveillance video has no audio.
The police said Tamir got in his waist and pulled out the gun. The video shows Loehmann, the officer on the passenger's side, leaving the car, and Tamir falls, apparently shot.
Between 1.5 and two seconds passed from the moment the car stopped until the moment Tamir was shot, Tomba said. At that time, only the passenger side officer was out of the car, the video shows.
One of the officers, radioing the office, reported that a black man, perhaps 20, was down, according to the radio traffic released between the officers and dispatchers.
The driver was Garmack, a six-year veteran of the force, according to Tomba.
Chief Calvin Williams said four minutes after Tamir was shot by an FBI detective and agent were at the scene. The FBI agent started first aid and the paramedics arrived three minutes later.
Investigators determined that Tamir's gun was an air pistol, and that an orange tip that is intended to indicate that it is not a real firearm had been removed, police said.

"Bill Gates is an American inventor, computer programmer, philanthropist, and entrepreneur born in Seattle, Washington. It is said to have a value of nearly $80 billion, making it one of the richest people in the country. He founded, and was head of Microsoft Corporation for years, and is still on the board for the computer software giant.

Gates was born into a upper-middle-class family. His father was a lawyer; his mother was a banker, who worked for United Way for many years. He is credited for being the father of the modern computer, and for almost just starting the revolution of the personal computer. He studied at Harvard University, but did not graduate because of his desire to develop new software.
As a 13-year-old student at Lakeside School, which was an exclusive college high school, Gates was introduced to computer programming. That year he developed a program that allowed users to play tic-tac-toe against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the computer's ability to play software code. In 1975, Gates approached a company called Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS). He convinced the owner that he had written a program that would work with his platform. The owner of the company bought Gates' innovations, and the two men reached an agreement to develop MITS software. The Microsoft Company was born.
Gates continued to develop the Windows operating system with IBM Corporation. However, the two companies had differences, and their association quickly ended. Gates left Microsoft in 2000, but remains on its board of directors. He remained active with the company for several years before resigning in February 2014, becoming a technical advisor to the company.",B2
"Halloween is October 31st. It is also called Vesper of All Saints or Vesper of All Saints. This is due, according to some, to the fact that the feast has its roots in a Christian feast reminiscent of the dead. Others say the holiday has its roots in the ancient traditions of Ireland's harvest season. In the United States, however, the focus is less on the memories of the deceased or agriculture. It's about kids getting dressed in scary costumes and going door to door asking for candy. This is called trick or deal. When children knock on a house door or ring the doorbell, they usually say ""Trick or Deal."" The ""trick"" part is a false threat that indicates that children will make a joke if they are not given something delicious. Homeowners give sweet children, raisins or some other food delicacies. Many homeowners decorate their homes to prepare for the holidays and let the children know that they are participating and can ring the bell for the sweets. Traditional decorations often include jack-o'-lanterns, which are pumpkins with carved faces on them and candles on the inside. Jack-o's lanterns were thought to frighten evil spirits when Halloween was celebrated for the first time among ancient Christians. Turnips, not pumpkins, were also used originally. People often decorate using the colors black and orange.

Halloween is not just for children; adults have fun attending costume parties. There are often contests for who has the best suit. There are also bobling games for apples, where people have to get an apple using only their teeth from a large bucket of water. Other people celebrate scaring themselves by going to haunted homes, homes where people dress up as ghosts, zombies and werewolves and jump to scare the guests. People also tell scary stories or watch horror movies.",B2

"Scarlett Johansson sues a French novelist for 50,000 euros in damages, claiming that her fictional work makes fraudulent claims about her personal life.
The Premiere chose qu’on mirae (the first thing we looked at) by Grégoire Delacourt tells the story of a French model that looks so much like the American actor that the main male character in the book thinks it is Johansson herself. In the novel, the appearance of the model means that men only see it as a sexual object, while women are jealous of it. She has a series of adventures like Johansson until she finally discovers herself and eventually dies in a car accident.
Johansson herself is not flattered by the best-selling literary work. His lawyer, Vincent Toledano, told Le Figaro that Delacourt’s novel constituted “a fraudulent and illegal violation and exploitation of his name, reputation and image.” He said the novel contains “defamatory claims about his private life” and has now gone to court to try to stop the translation or adaptation of the film book. The trial began in Paris on Wednesday afternoon, although neither Johansson nor Delacourt were present.
“The freedom of expression he defends as an artist is not in doubt,” Toledano said. “Such activities for purely commercial purposes have nothing to do with creativity.”
Delacourt has tried to explain that she chose to refer to Johansson because she is “the archetype of today’s beauty.” He said: “I wrote a fictional work. My character is not Scarlett Johansson.
The author recently confronted the actor on French radio, saying that the legal action was ""rather sad"". He said: “I’m afraid to think that when you talk about a character in a novel, judges can get involved.”
Delacourt has become one of the most beloved authors in France; his previous novel, My Wish List, was translated into 47 languages and is now adapting to a film. But he said he was ""no talking"" when he found out that Johansson was suing him.
“I thought she would contact me to ask me to go have coffee with her. I didn’t write a novel about a celebrity,” he said. “I wrote a true love story and a tribute to feminine beauty, especially inner beauty.
“If an author can no longer mention the things around us – a brand of beer, a monument, an actor – it will be difficult to produce fiction.
“It’s shocking, especially because I’m not sure I’ve read the novel, as it hasn’t been translated yet.”
Emmanuelle Allibert, spokesman for editor JC Lattès, said the legal action was “crazy.” “We have never known anything like this. It is even more surprising by the fact that the novel is not even about Scarlett Johansson. This is a woman who is twice Scarlett Johansson.”
Delacourt’s lawyer, Anne Veil, who also represents editor JC Lattès, said the charges were “totally scandalous.” “This is a literary, not a commercial approach. She has not been used as a product,” she said. “Grégoire Delacourt is not a paparazzo, he is a writer!”
Ironically, the author's legal situation would be much easier if he had published the book in the country of origin of Johansson, rather than France. Lloyd Jassin, a New York intellectual property attorney, told Time that the case would be unlikely to be considered in the United States because the book would be protected by the First Amendment.
“The First Amendment does not see most books as commercial uses or commercial proposals,” he said. “If his name or likeness is relevant, literaryly, if there is meaning and literary merit to use his name among the covers, the First Amendment comes into action.” However, in France, the legal position is more complicated and personality rights are taken “much more seriously,” says Jassin.
“I thought I could send flowers because it was a declaration of love for her, but I didn’t understand,” Delacourt said. “It’s a strange paradox, but very American.”

"Indignant waiters are asking for public support in a battle to hold on to their tips. PizzaExpress branches will be targeted by protesters as part of an attempt to get the restaurant chain to stop frizzing a proportion of tips for staff who have been paid with credit and debit cards. Activists have also launched an online petition in the hope that restaurant visitors will support their demands.
In a policy that has outraged some employees, PizzaExpress maintains, as an administrative fee, 8p of each £1 paid when tips are given by card. The chain, which has 430 branches throughout the UK and is particularly popular among families, makes an estimate of £1m per year of practice, according to the Unite union.
“We believe that this 8% rate is unfair and that, if the chain values its staff, it should be paying them the total advice given to them by customers,” said Chantal Chegrinec, Unite’s campaign officer. “We started with PizzaExpress, but they are not at all the only criminal and after this we will be focusing our attention on other companies.”
The protests are being organized by local Unite branches, and the first takes place at the branch office of the British PizzaExpress Museum in London. The union has also written to the CEO of the restaurant chain, Richard Hodgson. Unite started the campaign after a survey of its PizzaExpress members after the chain was sold to a Chinese private equity company, Hony Capital, in 2014. One of the main problems was the deduction of 8% of their advice.
A disgruntled PizzaExpress employee, who wants to remain anonymous, said the administration fee was costing him £3 per night. “I’ve worked at PizzaExpress for 15 years,” he said in a letter to Unite. “After all this time, I still get paid only the national minimum wage of 6.50 pounds an hour. So you see that my colleagues and I rely heavily on customer tips to supplement our low wages. I work hard and I’m good at my job, but when PizzaExpress thinks she can get away with taking a percentage of the tips we have left on a card, I get angry.”
PizzaExpress joins the Restaurant Chains Ask and Zizzi to extract 8% of the tips paid by card, but other chains deduct even more. Café Rouge, Bella Italia and Belgo deduct 10%, as do Strada and Giraffe, owned by Tesco.
A PizzaExpress spokesperson said his administrative position was to cover the cost of running a “tronc” – a standard payment arrangement used to distribute tips to staff. “We do a lot of work to establish this log system, which is chaired by a troncmaster and led by a committee of waiters and pizziers who decide independently how tips made by paying for electronic cards are then distributed to teams of front and back restaurants; a system run by employees for employees,” he said.
The chain, which sells 29 million pizzas a year through its UK restaurants, denied that it benefits from the administration fee. But other groups of restaurants do not deduct a board administration fee. Wagamama, Pizza Hut and TGI Friday don't drink anything. The Restaurant Group, owner of Frankie & Benny’s, Chiquitos and Garfunkels, used to charge 10%, but abandoned this policy several years ago.
Unite recently focused on ten PizzaExpress restaurants in southern London, distributing brochures to customers who were “disturbed and disgusted” by the practice. PizzaExpress says the charge is mentioned in small print at the bottom of its menus, but the employee who wrote to Unite said that, when she mentioned the charge to customers, it was always a surprise. Most would pay the cash tip. Almost 6,000 people have so far signed Unite's online petition.
A waiter, who does not work for PizzaExpress but has worked for 11 years for another chain of restaurants, said that at least a third of his income comes from tips. He doesn't want to be identified for fear of retaliation. “I work at a busy branch in London and, on a half-night, I will serve 150 people and take home 40 to 50 pounds in tips,” he says. “That may sound a lot, but that money is crucial to me, as my basic salary is only £6.50 an hour.”
Conservative MP Andrew Percy, who has asked for a change in the law that would give restaurant staff more control over tips, said he plans to raise the issue in parliament after the summer recess.”

"Afghan President Hamid Karzai said on Sunday that his country would join the strategic review of the U.S.-led war on terror.
Afghan President Hamid Karzai, on the right, meets Richard Holbrooke in Kabul on 15 February 2009.
Speaking at a joint press conference with U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke, Karzai said he is very, very grateful that President Barack Obama has accepted his proposal to join the review.
Holbrooke is visiting Afghanistan after a trip to neighboring Pakistan. Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took advantage of Holbrooke as a special representative for the two countries, a sign of how the new administration considers Afghanistan and Pakistan to be intertwined in any solution to the war in Afghanistan and the terrorist threat along its shared border.
At the Kabul press conference, Holbrooke said on Sunday that he conveyed the administration's support for the upcoming elections on 20 August, a date recently set by the Afghan electoral commission.
President Obama and Secretary Clinton and the U.S. government were very pleased to hear President Karzai reaffirm their support for the August 20 decision, Holbrooke said.
Holbrooke's visit comes as Obama plans to send another 30,000 troops to Afghanistan to fight what he has called the central front in our long-lasting fight against terrorism and extremism.
In an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria GPS, which aired on Sunday, Karzai said that, with a resurgent Taliban, a still flourishing drug trade and a border with Pakistan believed to be the base of al-Qaeda, his country cannot afford to allow American troops to leave soon.
“American forces will not be able to leave Afghanistan soon because the task is not over,” Karzai said. We have to defeat terrorism. We will have to allow Afghanistan to stand up. We will have to allow Afghanistan to be able to defend itself and protect for its safety...
Then, the United States can leave and, at that time, the Afghan people will give them lots of flowers and gratitude and send them home safely.
At the same time, Karzai said that the actions of the troops currently in Afghanistan have turned some of the citizens against them.
It is the question of civil cases. It is a matter of risk for Afghans. It's the question of home searches, he said. These activities are seriously undermining the confidence of the Afghan people in the joint fight against terrorism and undermining their hopeful future.
We'll still be friends. We'll remain an ally. However, Afghanistan deserves respect and better treatment.
Although he said he welcomed additional U.S. troops, Karzai suggested that they should work along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and in poppy fields that feed a drug trade that threatens to turn the nation into a narco-state, not in the villages where most Afghans live.
We've traveled many years. “What should have happened at first did not happen unfortunately,” Karzai said. Now, the country is not in the same mood as in 2002. Therefore, any addition of troops must have a determined objective with which the Afghan people agree.
The Obama administration is conducting several reviews of U.S. policy in Afghanistan, including a review of General David Petraeus, the commander in the region. Defense Secretary Robert Gates has said that the original mission in Afghanistan was too broad and needs to be more realistic and focused for the United States to succeed.
If we look at the goal of creating some kind of Central Asian Valhalla there, we will lose, because no one in the world has that kind of time, patience and money, Gates said during a recent Senate hearing.
He called for concrete targets that could be achieved in three to five years.
Speaking via satellite from Kabul, Karzai called former President George Bush a great person, but said he can work with Obama, despite the president's remarks as a candidate that Karzai had not left the bunker to improve security and infrastructure in Afghanistan.
President Obama is a great inspiration to the world, he said. The people of the United States have shown that they can really be the bearers of light for change and the will of the people in the world.
And his coming to power by the vote of the American people is a manifestation of that great power of the American people.
Karzai also recognized corruption in the Afghan government, but defended the work he has done to combat it.
Of course, corruption in the Afghan government is both there and in any other third world country, he said.
Suddenly this country received so much money from the West, suddenly so many Afghans came from all over the world to participate. Suddenly there were projects -- suddenly there was this poverty that became a kind of prosperity for this country, he said.
He said that a government department has been created to deal with corruption and that corrupt judges, administrators and other officials are fired daily on corruption charges.

"The Grand Canyon, one of the Seven Wonders of the Natural World, is located in the state of Arizona. It is also a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Formed by over 70 million years of erosion from the Colorado River, the Grand Canyon offers a spectacular view. The canyon spans 277 miles long, up to 18 miles wide, and measures more than a mile deep at its deepest points. Carlos always wanted to visit the Grand Canyon, and recently received the opportunity to tour some of the trails and take several panoramic photographs during his visit.
When Carlos arrived at the visitor centre, he saw a short film that taught tourists about the Grand Canyon National Park and the geological history of the canyon formation. Later, Carlos followed a hiking route to become even more familiar with the canyon. While walking along the trails, Carlos saw some tourists riding donkeys to cross the ridges of the canyon. Along his hiking expedition, Carlos used a map to find some of the best hot spots for photos inside the canyon. He reviewed some areas at different points of the day because solar angles and lighting can make a big difference in the quality of a photo.
Carlos was very happy to have traveled to the Grand Canyon. He loves hiking and photography, so this was the perfect outdoor experience for him. He put all his best photos on social media, and his friends were surprised by his stunning panoramic photos.",B2
"William Jefferson ""Bill"" Clinton was the 43rd U.S. President, presiding over the country for eight years between 1993 and 2001. He was the third youngest president to hold office, behind Theodore Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy. Clinton was a very popular president, who led the country during one of the most successful times in American history. Its economic policies greatly contributed to the country's economic strength during its term of office. Clinton is a member of the Democratic Party, and served as governor of the state of Arkansas for two five-year terms. He is credited with reviewing the state's education system during his term of office.

Clinton presided over the longest economic expansion in American history in times of peace. He is married to Hillary Clinton, whom he met at Yale Law School. Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013, after serving as Senator of the State of New York from 2001 to 2009. In addition, Hillary Clinton is considered one of the best prospects for winning the Democratic nomination for the 2016 presidential election. When Bill Clinton left office in 2001, he enjoyed the highest approval of the American public in U.S. history, but his presidency was not without controversy.
Bill Clinton's presidency was tarnished by the Monica Lewinsky affair. Lewinski was a White House intern who engaged in sexual activities with the president. Bill Clinton denied any misconduct, but his political opponents, the Republicans, pursued Clinton in an effort to damage his reputation and the Democratic Party in general. Republican politicians tried to remove Clinton from office and pursued him for years. In the end, Clinton survived the controversy, and completed his successful term as president. Hillary was at his side during the dark times, and the couple remains united to this day.",B2
"Hugh Hefner is one of the most controversial public figures in the United States. He is the founder, and president of Playboy magazine, which is a magazine for adult men. Since its humble beginnings in the 1950s, Hefner has grown its pornographic industry to become the multimillion-dollar company, which includes its magazine, television and Internet publication.

Born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1926, Hefner led a half-life growing in the big city. He graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and specialized in psychology. After serving two years in the U.S. Army, he began working as a copy editor at Esquire magazine in the early 1950s. Hefner quit his job to get out on his own. I was determined to start a magazine similar to Esquire, a men's magazine. His first Playboy was published from his home in 1953, with no publication date. He did it because he didn't know if there would be a second edition.
Hefner had bought a nude photo of the famous actress Marilyn Monroe, and used it as the central role of her first issue. The 50,000 copies were sold quickly, and Hefner became an instant success story. During the 1960s, Hefner and Playboy were at the peak of their popularity. His circulation was now millions, and Hefner ventured into new areas for his company. He produced films, began modeling agencies, built hotels and resorts, and hosted two television series. However, its publication was not without controversy.
In 1963, he was arrested and tried for publishing a photo of American actress Jayne Mansfield. The charges were finally dropped, but it was clear that there would be challenges to its publication because of its content. Hefner moved permanently to Los Angeles in 1975 to be closer to the film industry. He's been married three times, and he has four children.",B2
"The Mexican football team has just won a match against Croatia in the World Cup. This meant that Mexico advanced to the next round. Mexican football fans around the world are known for their loyalty to their team. However, after this victory, some wonder if they took their loyalty too far.

In Huntington Park, California, fans took to the streets after the victory. The afternoon crowd grew to almost 200 people. Fans waved flags, shouted, honked in their cars and jumped down the streets. The crowd was so big that they blocked traffic. This caused traffic jams in the area. While most of these fans were too enthusiastic, a handful were intoxicated. Instead of celebrating, they started throwing bottles. Some of the fans even started rocking cars parked on the streets. The police were called to the scene. The local police department not only sent patrols, two police helicopters flew over, and some police on horseback began trying to disperse the crowd. Someone threw a bottle at a police horse. The police urged shop owners to close their businesses. The police arrested five people. Fortunately, no one was injured.
When Mexico returned to play the following week, police patrolled the streets in advance. This time they were going to be prepared if Mexico won again. Mexico was playing against the Netherlands. The Dutch team won 2-1. Mexican fans in Huntington Park still took to the streets despite the loss. This time the police were waiting on riot gear. Fans waved flags, sang, played horns, rocked cars and even lit firecrackers, but no one threw bottles. The police didn't arrest anyone. However, they had to shut down three blocks of traffic. The police were probably secretly glad Mexico didn't win. In four years, when the next World Cup happens, they will again worry about it.",B2
"Christina visited Miami during her winter vacation. She's from Boston, where it's cold during the winter months. Miami, however, has a very warm climate. There are many sunny days in Miami, and people can go to the beach all year round. Christina spent a good part of her trip on the beach to relax and sunbathe. However, he also explored Miami and its surroundings.
Inspired by Miami's proximity to the ocean, Christina visited the Miami Seaquarium to learn about marine life. There, he saw a show using trained dolphins, killer whales and other aquatic mammals. He took a lot of pictures of sea creatures jumping out of the water and doing tricks.
Christina also made an excursion to Everglades National Park. This park is a protected area covering 1.5 million hectares. Because the park is mostly swampy, it is home to many reptiles. Native animals include snakes, alligators and crocodiles. The park is also ideal for bird watching. Christina enjoyed walking the Everglades trails and observing wildlife in its natural environment.
When Christina returned to the city, she visited Little Havana. This is the Cuban neighborhood of Miami. Christina could see that the people of Little Havana showed great pride for their Cuban heritage. There were many outdoor shops and vendors, live musicians, and Cuban cuisine was delicious. Little Havana was Christina's favorite part about her trip to Miami. This neighborhood made Christina feel as if she had traveled to Cuba without having to leave the United States.

"Levi Aron was prosecuted in a New York court on Thursday for charges of murder and first-degree kidnapping in the murder of an 8-year-old boy and remained under suicide surveillance until a mental evaluation was completed.
Aron, 35, showed no emotion as he entered the court handcuffed and did not make a plea. He said earlier in a statement that he regretted the problems he has caused, New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said.
Defence lawyers Pierre Bazile and Gerard Marrone told the court that Aron heard voices and requested an examination to determine whether he understood the charges. The next appointment in Aron's court is July 28.
Charles J. Hynes, Kings County District Attorney, had said he would ask a grand jury for the maximum legal charges for the cruel and insensitive murder and dismemberment of eight-year-old Leiby Kletzky.
The police found human remains in Aron's freezer and a trash can that they think are the boy's, who disappeared Monday afternoon.
Kelly called the heartbreaking case.
Obviously there is a lot of violence in this business, but there is usually some kind of twisted irrational logic that is given to why a violent event took place, Kelly said.
Here, I mean, it's just, it challenges all logic and I think that's what's really so, so terribly disturbing about this case. There is absolutely no reason. There's nothing more innocent than an 8-year-old boy and being, you know, murdered this way is just... heartbreaking.
Police said 35-year-old Aron made statements on Wednesday involving himself in Kletzky's death. They are both members of the nearby Jewish Orthodox community in Brooklyn.
Kelly said the detectives found the remains in a freezer in Aron's third floor attic and in a trash can more than two miles away, wrapped in a black plastic trash bag inside a suitcase.
The cause of death has not yet been determined, but the police believe Kletzky was suffocated.
Kletzky was supposed to meet his parents after walking seven blocks from his summer camp, but he got lost and asked the suspect for directions, Kelly said.
The surveillance video showed Aron entering a dentist's office on Monday while Kletzky waited across the street for seven minutes, Kelly said.
Aron claims he took Kletzky to a wedding Monday night in Monsey, New York, and then brought him back, Kelly said. The police said Aron went to the wedding, but they couldn't confirm that Kletzky really went with him, since no one said they saw him.
According to Kelly, the police showed up at Aron's residence at 2:40 a.m. on Wednesday and asked him about Kletzky's whereabouts. The suspect pointed them to the kitchen, where the blood was visible on the freezer handle. Inside the refrigerator was a cutting board with three blood-stained cut knives, Kelly said.
Aron, an employee of a maintenance supply company, did not seem to have met Kletzky, Kelly said. His only known criminal subpoena was for urination in public last year.
Kelly said the statements made by the suspect indicated that he kidnapped Kletzky and, when the search for the child in the neighborhood intensified, panicked and killed him.
“We are all in shock,” State Assemblyman Dov Hikind said of the people in his district. What kind of people are able to create these crazy acts?
Aron's former wife, Debbie Aron from Memphis, Tennessee, said she's been in total shock since she heard the news.
She said that her children from a previous marriage lived with her when she was married to Levi Aron and that he helped them take care of them. He also enjoyed karaoke.
I can't believe it. She's definitely not in her character as... the person I met, she told CNN affiliate WMC. Even when I spoke to him not long ago, everything was fine, with no indication that something was wrong.
After Kletzky disappeared on Monday, residents joined local and federal authorities in a massive search effort.
FBI spokesman Jim Margolin said the FBI helped interview witnesses and deployed the FBI Children's Crimes Brigade in the case.

"Scott received a paintball gun and some paintballs from his mother for his 16th birthday. When her mother gave her the gift, she told her that she would take him to a range of paintball with some of her friends. The range was in an open field and the company that owned the range provided security equipment such as filling and face masks. Being hit by an injured paintball and could cause serious injuries. The paintball range was 20 miles away, and Scott had to wait until the weekend to try his new team. I didn't want to wait that long. He wanted to play with his new toy now.

When his mother was taking a nap, he sent a message to a friend who lived on the block to meet him in front of his house. ""I want to show you what I have for my birthday,"" Scott told his friend. He loaded the paintball gun with colored balls filled with brightly colored paint. He started shooting at the trash cans on the sidewalk. Just then a police patrol was driving down the street. Scott lost the trash cans and ended up shooting a paintball right in the police car. The police thought they were under attack. Scott knew he had done something wrong and ran inside the house with his friend. Soon a police helicopter flew over, and Scott could hear police sirens approaching his house.
The sounds of the helicopter and the sirens woke Scott's mother. He looked out the window and saw a spotlight on his house, and three police cars arrived. ""What's going on?"" He wondered out loud. She went to the living room and turned on the local news to see if there was any information about what was going on in her neighborhood.",B2
"The military released 77,000 of some 87,000 detainees locked up during the Iraq war because there was not enough evidence to hold them, CNN has learned.
“In most cases, if we have nothing, they will eventually be released,” Brig said. General David Quantock, who oversees the operations of detainees in Iraq.
Quantock said many cases are purely intelligence-driven.
Intelligence doesn't win a fight in a court of law. He doesn't win the fight in a court of law in the United States. He doesn't win in Iraq.
According to the U.S. military, 76,985 detainees have been released from the 87,011 captured during the Iraq war.
An investigation by CNN found that frustration with the Army's policy on detainees could have led to the death in 2007 of four Iraqi men by three army sergeants decorated on a Baghdad canal.
Former first sergeant. John Hatley, who led the mission that day, told CNN in a letter that the detention policy has extensive flaws that repeatedly frustrated the soldiers.
On the Army interrogation tapes obtained by CNN, other soldiers complained about Army standards for gathering evidence.
Despite the high rate of liberation, Quantock said he is confident that soldiers can take basic evidence from a crime scene in Iraq.
We ask them to take basic evidence, for which they have been trained, said Quantock, who oversees the operations of the detainees in Iraq. We have the best soldiers in the world. And I don't accept that they can't get basic evidence from the crime scene.
CNN asked Quantock to explain why, if it was so easy to gather evidence, so many detainees had been released.
It took us a while to realize, it goes back to my point that we were trying to make the fight fit into the Army instead of the Army fitting into the fight, Quantock said.
I think many times we thought the insurgency would dissipate, we were working closely with the Iraqi government, we were trying to improve the Iraqi security forces, but at the end of the day, it didn't work out very well. We had to get better to get evidence from the crime scene.
A memorandum of 9 January 2005 imposed detailed rules on the evidence that soldiers needed before they received alleged insurgents in Iraq. Quantock told CNN that the rules detailed in the memorandum were in force until the end of 2008.
The memorandum states that evidence of criminal activity should include photographs of physical evidence, the detainee at the crime scene or the place of arrest, as well as photographs of the detainee along with evidence. Other evidence must include statements written by first-hand witnesses of criminal activity, the memorandum states.
Earlier this year, the rules became even stricter. A security agreement with the Iraqi government now requires an arrest warrant signed by an Iraqi judge to arrest someone.
Asked about the murders on the channel, Quantock told CNN: There is never an excuse to execute anyone. They become judges, jurors and executioners.

"U.S. Representative Rahm Emanuel will bring a pragmatic, hard-thinking approach to the White House when he becomes the head of staff of President-elect Barack Obama, according to people who know the native of Chicago, Illinois.
Representative Rahm Emanuel has experience in the White House, Wall Street and Capitol Hill.
Emanuel, former assistant to President Clinton, has accepted the position in the new administration, Obama confirmed in a statement on Thursday.
I announce this appointment first because the chief of staff is central to the ability of a president and an administration to achieve an agenda, Obama said. And no one I know is better at doing things than Rahm Emanuel.
At work, Emanuel would supervise the White House staff. The chief of staff is usually involved in all the important decisions made by the president and is responsible for ensuring that the administration fulfills the president's wishes. Look how Emanuel calls himself lucky.
The chief of staff is also often involved in negotiations with Congressional leaders when important legislation is under consideration.
Jim Manley, spokesman for Senate majority leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, called Emanuel: An excellent election.
Rahm knows the hill. And he knows the White House. “He is a brilliant strategic thinker and someone who knows how to do things,” Manley said.
Manley also rejected the idea that Emanuel is a true partisan who could not work with the Republicans.
That's ridiculous. Rahm understands that politics is the art of compromise. He has a number of deeply rooted points of view but he also understands that to do things you have to come to an agreement, he said.
After leaving the Clinton White House, Emanuel, 48, was an investment banker on Wall Street and later elected to the House of Representatives in 2002 from a heavily Democratic Chicago district. He quickly rose to become the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House. Look what Emanuel brings to the White House.
It's Emanuel's combination of experiences, in addition to his strong personal relationship with Obama, that would make him a strong chief of staff, said CNN political analyst Paul Begala, a Clinton veteran.
He has spent more time in the White House than President-elect Obama. That matters a lot. “It is a special place with its own rhythms,” Begala said. See who Obama may be considering for his cabinet
But, perhaps most importantly, it has the relationship. He's known Barack and Michelle Obama for several years.
Before reports emerged that he had accepted the position, Emanuel told WLS-TV in Chicago that he had to consider the possible impact on his family. See how Obama is starting his transition
I have a lot to weigh: the basis of public service, to which I have given my life, a career choice. And most importantly, what I want to do as a father, Emanuel said in an interview that aired on Wednesday.
Emanuel added: This is not a professional option. This is a personal choice about what my wife and I want to do for our family, as much as what to do with my career.
Emanuel's strong focus would ensure that the White House works smoothly for the new president, said Mack McLarty, Clinton's former chief of staff. See how McLarty calls Emanuel an excellent choice
Rahm is high-energy. It's direct. He's a hard-minded pragmatist. So I think the years have been good for him in that sense, McLarty said. I think the high-energy steering will do you good.
Rahm, like many of us, made mistakes, but quickly corrected them.
However, the legislator's direct style has shaken several feathers in Washington, and Emanuel is known as one of the Capitol's toughest partisan fighters.
After reports that Emanuel had agreed to be Obama's chief of staff on Thursday, minority leader John Boehner of Ohio questioned the election of the elected president. Electoral T-shirt: Obama inspires historic victory
This is an ironic election for an elected president who has promised to change Washington, make politics more civilized and rule from the center, Boehner said.
According to a 2006 profile of Emanuel in Fortune magazine, Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma warned his Republican colleagues of Emanuel's ferocity in a letter two years ago.
It's dangerous, Cole told Fortune then. It has a closing intensity. When he has a political murder in sight, he is absolutely implacable.
But David Gergen, a senior CNN political analyst who has worked in five administrations, said contrasting styles between Obama and Emanuel could help the new president do things in Washington.
Obviously they're setting up a good police/bad police routine in the White House... Barack Obama may be the good guy, Gergen said. iReport.com: Who should be in Obama's cabinet?
Emanuel has made a career of being the tough guy.
In the profile of Fortune 2006, Begala described Emanuel's aggressive style as a cross between a hemorrhoid and toothache.
I love Rahm, but that's a small group of us, he told Fortune.

"George Zimmerman's father, the man accused of shooting and killing and unarmed black teenager, says the teenager threatened to kill Zimmerman and beat him so much that he forced Zimmerman to shoot Trayvon Martin.
Trayvon Martin said something in the sense that you're going to die now or you're going to die tonight, something in that sense, Robert Zimmerman told Orlando's WOFL news station. He continued to beat George. At some point, George pulled out his gun. He did what he did.
In the interview with Robert Zimmerman, his face was darkened because he says he fears for his safety, vehemently defended the shooting that has caused outrage across the nation, moved President Obama to call it a tragedy, and prompted a federal investigation.
Robert Zimmerman told the news station that Martin faced his son first and struck his son continuously.
He got punched in the nose. “His nose was broken,” Robert Zimmerman said. They hit him against the concrete. Trayvon Martin got on top of him and started hitting him. In the face. In his nose, banging his head in the concrete.
Robert Zimmerman wasn't there the night of the shooting and didn't say during the interview how he knew the details of the altercation.
The account of old Zimmerman was disputed by Martin's family lawyer and several other legal experts.
A surveillance video recorded on the night of the incident at police headquarters shows Zimmerman, handcuffed, leaving a patrol car.
The video, first aired on Wednesday by ABCNews.com, shows an officer looking at the back of Zimmerman's head. The video did not provide a close-up of Zimmerman's head, but some say it shows that Zimmerman had no significant injuries to his face.
The wounds that made it sound like I really should have been on a stretcher are not evident on this tape at all, said Marcia Clark, the ex-prosecutor at the O.J. Simpson trial. It moves freely. It moves smoothly, not like someone who just went through a beating in any form or form, someone whose head has been hit on the pavement as hard as described, someone who had a broken nose and bleeding. That tells you a lot.
Sybrina Fulton, Martin's mother, said the video is another compelling evidence that shows that her son was unjustly murdered.
I think this video is the icing on the cake, he said. This is not the first part of the evidence they've had. They've had the 911 tapes and they've also had witnesses. This is besides what the Sanford Police Department has always had. There's no problem with this case and he needs to be arrested.
The 17-year-old was shot dead on February 26 by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watchman, as Martin walked back to his fiancé's house in Sanford, Florida. He was wearing a hoodie and carrying Skittles candy and a can of iced tea he had bought at a nearby store.
Zimmerman says he killed Martin in self-defense after the teenager attacked him in the closed community. Zimmerman has not been arrested and authorities have said he has not been charged because there is no reason to refute his story of what happened.
The shooting has hit a nerve in the nation, sparked a debate about racial profiling and sparked protests and calls for Zimmerman's arrest.
Robert Zimmerman said his son is having a hard time dealing with criticism.
I've never predicted so much hatred coming from the president, the Black Congress Caucus, the NAACP. Every imaginable organization is trying to get notoriety or benefit from this somehow, Robert Zimmerman said WOFL. But there's so much hatred that I've never been involved in hatred and George hasn't. It's really amazing.
Robert Zimmerman said his son is not racist and that race had nothing to do with the incident.
I'd do anything to help anyone at any time. “He is blind in color when it comes to any race,” Robert Zimmerman said.
Tracy Martin, Martin's father, said Wednesday that the 911 tape shows that Zimmerman was profiling his son.
In a recording of Zimmerman's call to the police, some people have said they hear what sounds like a possible racial insult. CNN improved the sound of the 911 call, and several CNN editorial staff repeatedly reviewed the tape, but could not reach consensus on whether Zimmerman used an insult.
Angela Corey, the special prosecutor assigned to investigate the case, said Tuesday that investigators would investigate allegations that Zimmerman used a racial insult.
Martin, who lived in Miami, was visiting Sanford after receiving a 10-day suspension from school, a family spokesman said. An empty plastic bag found in his book bag was determined to contain marijuana residue.
Crump, Martin's parent's lawyer, said that information about the suspension was irrelevant and amounted to a smear campaign against young people.
Florida law allows the use of deadly force anywhere a person feels a reasonable fear of death or serious injury. It has been cited in a number of justifiable homicide cases in Florida.
But as more and more information becomes available, the image of what happened becomes more complicated.
Despite the twists and turns in the Fulton case, Martin's mother, says she still has faith in the authorities investigating her son's case.
“I am sure they will do a thorough investigation,” Fulton said. We're trying to be patient, even though it's been over a month. We're trying to be patient, and we're trying to move forward for justice.

Tony and Kevin had been very close friends in elementary school. They began their friendship while doing a little painting task. When Kevin noticed Tony painting a very nice rocket, Kevin congratulated him and the two began to talk about his interest in other things. What really kept them together at the time was when Tony recognized Kevin's reaction when Tony accidentally dropped his set of paintings on the floor of the class. Tony was embarrassed and terrified, but Kevin didn't hesitate to help him clean it up.
Growing up, Tony and Kevin shared similar interests. When they were in primary school, they both shared a dream of becoming astronauts and flying into spaceships to discover unknown galaxies and unknown life forms. In high school, they both shared the dream of becoming famous basketball players. So, in high school, they both had the urge to become famous rock stars.
It wasn't always a happy friendship. Sometimes, they both fought and shared different views on different things. Despite their differences, Tony and Kevin did not destroy their friendship. In times of pain and doubt, they were there to support each other.

"Mr. Rogers' neighborhood was one of the most successful and appreciated children's programs in the history of public television. Public television differs from the most common commercial television in that it is not financed by advertising revenue. Public television is a nationwide network of television stations dedicated to bringing alternative programs to the people of the United States.

Mr. Rogers' neighborhood ran from February 1968 to August 2001, and was presented by the program's homonym, Fred Rogers. It was a half-hour children's program that featured popular Rogers as host. He's often known as Mr. Rogers' show.
Rogers began his show in 1953 at a PBS station in the northeastern part of the country as the Children's Corner. He acted as a puppeteer, and was broadcast on live television. There Rogers developed many of the characters that would become famous as his show progressed. In 1967, his programme went on national television, and he remained there until 2001.
Rogers' style and calm made him an instant celebrity who liked both children and adults. In his early years, Rogers studied to become a Presbyterian minister, but he did not like the way children's programming was presented. He began writing children's songs, and soon began his own local program on public television. Over the next three decades, Rogers became a true American icon through his show. His great compassion, morality, and patience were possibly his most beloved characteristics.
Rogers was not only a great TV personality, he was also a human rights defender. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, as well as the Peabody Award for his meritorious public service. Rogers was included in the TV Hall of Fame, and has received approximately 40 honorary degrees.",B2
"Former F1 champion Michael Schumacher has been discharged from a Swiss hospital and is returning home, where he will continue his recovery from head injuries sustained in a ski accident last year, his spokesman said Tuesday.
Taking into account the serious injuries he suffered, progress has been made in recent weeks and months, Sabine Kehm said.
However, there is still a long and difficult way to go.
Schumacher, 45, suffered severe head trauma in a ski accident at the French Alps complex in Meribel on 29 December.
His research team said he believed that the experienced skier hit a rock hidden under the snow as he crossed an area between two marked tracks, catapulting him in front of another rock.
He was first treated in a hospital in Grenoble, France, and then in June moved to a hospital in Lausanne, Switzerland, near the Schumacher family home.
Kehm appealed, as he did before, to respect the privacy of his family while Schumacher continued his recovery.
The German national is a seven-time world champion whose F1 race ended in 2012.

"They call it the Robin Hood of the banks, a man who took out dozens of loans worth almost half a million euros, with no intention of ever paying them. Instead, Enric Duran handed over the money to projects that created and promoted alternatives to capitalism.
After 14 months in hiding, Duran does not apologize, even though his activities could lead him to jail. “I’m proud of what I did,” he said in a Skype interview from an undisclosed location. The money, he said, had created opportunities. “It generated a movement that allowed us to advance in the construction of alternatives. And it allowed us to build a powerful network that brings together these initiatives.”
From 2006 to 2008, Duran took 68 commercial and personal loans from 39 banks in Spain. He took the money out of social activists, funding anti-capitalist talk tours and television cameras for a media network. “I saw that, on the one hand, these social movements were building alternatives but lacked resources and communication capabilities,” he said. “In the meantime, our dependence on perpetual growth was creating a system that created money out of nothing.”
The loans he was swindling banks were his way of regulating and denouncing this situation, he said. It started slowly. “I filled out some credit requests with my real details. They denied me, but I just wanted to have an idea of what they were asking for.”
From there, the former table tennis coach began to weave a intricate network of accounts, payments and transfers. “I was constantly learning.” By the summer of 2007, he had discovered how to make the system work, applying for loans under the name of a fake television production company. “Then, I managed to get a lot.” €492,000, to be exact.
Duran was arrested in Spain in 2009, on charges brought against him by six of the 39 banks that had lent him money. He spent two months in prison before being rescued for 50,000 euros. In February 2013, in front of eight years in prison, he decided to flee instead of being tried. “I don’t see legitimacy in a judicial system based on authority, because I don’t recognize its authority,” he said.
His actions, he said, were at the forefront of a global debate on the economic crisis. Time brought the anti-capitalist movement to light, as many Spaniards sought alternatives to a system that had wreaked havoc on their lives.
Although the same actions are likely to be better understood in Spain today, he said they would not be necessary. The anti-capitalist movement has grown from a marginal movement to one supported by thousands of Spaniards, he said, evidenced by broadly supported movements such as the Indignados.
Success has helped make the movement self-sufficient. “We now have the capacity to generate resources,” Duran said, ironically adding that this is exactly what banks issue credit for – “to move forward and generate a situation that allows you to be independent.” Duran is expanding its approach to include the Spanish justice system, promoting restorative justice. “People in Spain who think banks don’t work, think I don’t owe anything. I’ve already done my job,” he said. “But there is a part of a population that disagrees with us and I think it should respond to that.”
In his case, he said, the element of reciprocity that he could offer to banks could be in the perception that he obtained of years of fraudulent bank loans. He could share his ideas about “what best practices work and which ones don’t,” he suggested, “for the general population and for the bank’s workers.”

"Boxing is great in America. The history of sport precedes the establishment of the United States for thousands of years. The ancient Greeks are said to have included a form of boxing up to 600 BC.The modern sport of boxing dates back to the 16th century when it became a popular sport in Britain. Today, the sport still uses a variation of the Marquis de Queensberry rules that were established in 1867. Boxing is the purest form of competition. He confronts one man, or woman, against another in a closed ring with only the person's fists as weapons. The first matches in the United States included fights with naked knuckles, but today boxers wear protective gloves.

One of America's most successful boxers is Mike Tyson. Tyson has several boxing records. The biggest is possibly when he became the youngest boxer to win the heavyweight championship in three different boxing organizations. Tyson was just over 20 years old when he accomplished this feat. He was one of the most feared fighters of his time. Tyson won a total of 50 fights with 44 of those knockout wins.
Twelve of Tyson's knockouts arrived in the first round, which earned him the nickname Iron Mike. Eventually, his advanced age and fast life charged his price at Tyson. By the early 1990s, his career was almost over. Although his boxing career lasted until 2002, Tyson was never the same. He went on to a short career as an actor, especially in the popular 2009 comedy The Hangover.
Tyson's post-boxing career had its ups and downs. He appeared on Barbara Walter's show with his wife, television actress Robin Givens, where Givens called Tyson manic-depressive, and that living with him was pure torture. Tyson was arrested in 1991 for raping an 18-year-old girl, and spent several years in prison. He has tried several reappearances, but has never regained his old glory.",B2
"Woodstock Music and Art Fair, commonly called Woodstock, was an American music and art celebration that took place from August 15 to 18, 1969. It was declared ""3 Days of Peace and Music"", and was a defining event for the young generation of Americans of the time.

The 1960s was a shocking era in American history. Many of the events that took place during those controversial 10 years deeply affect modern American society today. The war in Vietnam was raging in the 1960s, and popular president John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. These are just two of the events that defined the decade. There were many more historical events during that time that deeply divided the country. Woodstock was designed to show how the young generation can coexist with the older generation of Americans living in harmony with each other.
Although the event did not take place in Woodstock City, New York, the city has become synonymous with the celebration. More than 400,000 young people gathered at the dairy farm in the small town of White Lake, New York, to witness the history of music. Rolling Stone Magazine listed the event as one of ""the 50 moments that changed the history of rock 'n' roll"". Some of the biggest names in rock history were featured at the three-day event, including The Who, The Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin, Jefferson Airplane, and Jimi Hendrix. In total, 32 events were held at the open-air festival, and it was free for everyone.
Two soundtracks were released in the next two years. Both albums presented live performances with presentations. The documentary film ""Woodstock"" was released in 1970, and received an Oscar in the Academy Documentary category. It was also considered culturally significant by the United States, Library of Congress.",B2
"Nelson Mandela was an anti-apartheid South African activist and human rights defender whose life had a profound effect on American culture. Mandela was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999, but his history began decades earlier. The work of his life was to bring South Africa to the dominant thought of the 20th century by putting an end to Apartheid.

Apartheid is a South African system of government based on racial segregation between the minority white population and Black South Africans. It was a controversial form of government that was in effect from 1948 to 1994, and caused great social upheaval. The system was launched after World War II, but racial segregation began much earlier in the country. apartheid separated South Africans by race, placing people in four classifications: white, black, colored and Indian. Each group had different levels of privilege, with white South Africans being the most favored.
From 1960 to 1983, 3.5 million Black South Africans were forcibly expelled from their homes; in 1970, all non-white politicians were expelled from government. Mandela's movement to end apartheid began in 1949 when he supported and organized non-violent boycotts, strikes and civil disobedience. He was arrested and charged with treason in 1956 for his role in the social uprising, and was finally imprisoned for 27 years. During this time, most countries of the world called for their release and put trade embargoes against the white regime.
The country finally gave way to international pressure, and freed Mandela. It became an international symbol for peaceful demonstration, and for its humanitarian work and perseverance. He was elected President of South Africa in 1994, serving for six years. Mandela died in December 2013.",B2
"In the end, it was always Robin.
That was the big bomb of the last episode of Monday night's How I Meet Your Mother, which piled up in one surprise after another.
When Ted finally finished the story for his children, they called it: His story wasn't all about how he met his mother - LRB- she was just in the story -RRB-, it was about how much he loved Robin.
As many had theorized, the mother of Ted's sons - LRB-, whose name was Tracy McConnell, by the way -RRB-, had been dead for years at the time she told her story.
So, in the last of many flash-forwards in this finale, Ted went to the street in front of Robin's apartment and appeared with that blue French horn, the same one he stole for her in the first episode.
Robin, of course, had divorced Barney a long time ago... the first big surprise of the night.
Barney, however, would learn, became a father, and in one of several moving scenes of the episode, he finally found the love of his life in baby Ellie.
Marshall and Lily, pregnant with their second child today, went on to have a third, but Lily had a broken heart when Robin decided she could no longer be part of her gang, partly because Barney was still, well, Barney around her.
What about the mother, a.k.a. Tracy? We finally saw that moment of the meeting of the two at that train station, and it was performed perfectly by Josh Radnor and worthy Emmy Cristin Milioti.
They would not marry for several years, having postponed their wedding when Tracy became pregnant with her first child.
Ted shared with his children that he learned that he had to love his mother with everything he had in him, through the good and bad times, especially during his illness.
Needless to say, the show remained true to form, as it had in all its nine years, carrying its heart in its sleeve. And if your eyes remained dry throughout the episode, you're probably a stronger person than most viewers.
Of course, the big spin Robin did not sit exactly well with everyone online -LRB- people like Rocco Horvath @RoccoRacingAMA, who tweeted, It took me so long to overcome the fact that Ted and Robin were not going to end up together and now this?! Mixed Emotions -RRB-, and the end seems to have divided viewers more than any since Lost.
Other viewers were more indulgent. #HIMYM the creators remained true to the story, tweeted fan John Eisele. The end fits the show, even if it's not what I wanted. I can't stop thinking about it. #HIMYMFinale.
What do you think? I wish Tracy would have stayed alive and Ted wouldn't end up with Robin? Or do you think it was a proper ending? For the case, what do you think of Barney and Robin separating? Let us know in the comments and give yourself a self-five to do it all the way through nine stations.

"Gabriela worked for a multinational company as a successful project manager in Brazil and was transferred to manage a team in Sweden. She was excited about her new role, but soon realized that managing her new team would be a challenge.
Despite her kindness, Gabriela did not feel respected as a leader. His new staff openly questioned his proposals at meetings, and when he gave them instructions on how to carry out a task, they often did so in their own way without consulting her. When she announced her decisions on the project, they would continue to give their opinions as if they were still under discussion.
After weeks of frustration, Gabriela emailed her Swedish manager about the problems she faced with her team. His manager simply asked him if he felt that his team was still acting, and what he thought would help him to better collaborate with his team members. Gabriela found her manager lazy and didn't feel like she was managing the situation satisfactorily.
What Gabriela was experiencing was a cultural clash in expectations. She was used to a more hierarchical framework in which the team leader and manager took control and gave specific instructions on how things should be done. This more management style worked well for her and her team in Brazil, but it was not well transferred to their new team in Sweden, which were more accustomed to a more flat hierarchy where decision-making was more democratic. When Gabriela took the matter to her Swedish manager, instead of intervening with instructions on what to do, her manager took on the role of coach and focused on getting her to come forward with her own solutions instead.
Dutch social psychologist Geert Hofstede uses the concept of ""distance from power"" to describe how power is distributed and how hierarchy is perceived in different cultures. In her previous work environment, Gabriela was accustomed to a culture of high power at a distance where power and authority are respected and each has its legitimate place. In such a culture, leaders make great decisions and are not often challenged. His Swedish team, however, was used to working in a low-powered distance culture where subordinates often work together with their bosses to find solutions and make decisions. Here, leaders act as coaches or mentors who encourage independent thinking and hope to be challenged.
When Gabriela realized the cultural differences between her and her team, she took the initiative of having an open conversation with them about their feelings about their leadership. Delighted to be asked for their thoughts, Gabriela's team openly expressed that they were not used to being told what to do. They enjoyed having more space for initiative and creative freedom. When you told your team exactly what you needed them to do, they felt that you didn't trust them to do your job well. They realized that Gabriela was taking it personally when they tried to challenge or make changes in their decisions, and they were able to explain that it was the way they had always worked.
With a better understanding of the underlying reasons behind each other's behavior, Gabriela and her team were able to adapt their way of working. Gabriela was then able to make adjustments to her management style to better match her team's expectations and motivate her team more effectively to achieve her goals.",B2
"Abraham Lincoln is a name that is always embedded in the collective consciousness of all Americans. It is perhaps the most recognizable name in the history of the country, even when his death occurred about 150 years ago. Lincoln presided over the country during, perhaps, the most divisive era in its history. Lincoln served as president for only four short years, but his impact on the country at that time, and today, has been enormous.

During his presidency, the United States was in the midst of a terrible civil war. At the center of the division between the two sides was slavery. The north was a fast-growing industrial region that was more progressive than its southern counterpart. The economy of the South was based on cotton production that used forced labour for the most part. The north considered this unethical and immoral practice, while the southerners claimed that it was an integral part of their culture. When Lincoln won the elections, the southern states began to separate from the Union, and the war began.
Lincoln promised to end slavery during his campaign for the president, while never talking about how the country would maintain its relationship with the southern states when slavery ended. This angered many southerners who promised to rebel if Lincoln won. The war lasted four years, and about 620,000 soldiers died. In what is considered the turning point of the war, Lincoln issued his famous Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863. What he did was win the world’s international favor for his ethical qualities. Press countries that do business with the south to review their practices. It actually put an end to the war. Lincoln was murdered on April 15, 1865 by a Southern sympathizer while sitting in a theater with his wife.",B2
"He arrived – in his own words, in 2005 – as “a simple and humble worker in God’s vineyard”. And on a grey, cold and blush Monday in February, Pope Benedict XVI signed in the same way: as an old worker who can no longer ignore the pains on his back; who can no longer count on the strength of his arms. Characteristically for this more traditional pontiff mind, he made his excuses in Latin. The first German pope in modern times timed his departure until the minute. “From February 28, 2013, at 8 p.m.,” he told a meeting of cardinals in the Vatican, “the seat of Rome, the seat of St. Peter, will be vacant and a conclave to elect the new Supreme Pontiff will have to be summoned by those whose competence is.”
Among those present was a Mexican prelate, Monsignor Oscar Sanchéz Barba of Guadalajara. He was in Rome to be told the date of a canonization in which he has played a leading role. “We were all in the Concistor Hall in the third lodge of the Apostolic Palace,” he said. “After giving the date of canonization, on May 12, the Pope took a sheet of paper and read it.
“We all stayed...” – Sanchéz Barba looked around at Bernini’s colonnade that embraces St. Peter’s Square, clinging to the word, as mute as the “princes of the church” who had just heard the man they believe is God’s representative on earth quit at work. The cardinals looked at each other, said Sanchéz Barba.
Angelo Sodano, dean of the College of Cardinals, who should have been warned, gave a brief speech, perhaps in a hasty manner. Before assuring the Pope of the loyalty and devotion of the cardinals, he said that he and the others present “had listened to them with a feeling of bewilderment, almost completely unbelieving. ” At the end of his speech, the Pope blessed those present, and left. “It was so simple; the simplest imaginable,” said Sanchéz Barba. Then we all went quietly. There was absolute silence... and sadness.
John Thavis, who spent 30 years reporting about the Holy See and whose book, The Vatican Diaries, will soon be published, said he had had an intuition that the Pope might be about to resign and timed his return to Rome from the US. Consequently. A fellow Vatican surveillance officer confirmed that this is the case. Thavis pointed out that in the long interview Benedict gave to a German journalist, published as Luz del Mundo in 2010, he had made it clear that he felt it would be right to go if he felt he was no longer up to the job. “I wondered: if I was Pope and I wanted to quit, when would I choose? He has completed his series of books and most of his projects are under way. What's more, there were no dates in his calendar of events that he had to attend personally. I thought the most likely date was February 22, which is the feast of the Chair of Saint Peter. So I was wrong.”
The line that emerged from the Vatican within hours of the announcement was that the Pope's decision was courageous. For this reason, Benedict, who never retreats from the statements and decisions that shock him, had been in charge of addressing the reality of his Church: the reality that contemporary medicine can keep men alive well beyond the age in which they are willing to meet the demands of leading a vast world organization. Thavis agreed: “What I find particularly brave is that he is willing to say now, when he is not sick, that he is going; and that he is doing so because he is tired and not because he is particularly ill.” But is that the whole story? Do you know more about your state of health than the Vatican has made public so far?
Benedict’s own account of his reasons makes it clear that he took into account not only his physical condition, but also his psychological condition: “To govern the crust of St. Peter and proclaim the Gospel, both the strength of the mind and that of the body are necessary, a force that in recent months has deteriorated in me to the extent that I have had to recognize my inability to properly carry out the ministry entrusted to me.” Other theories will undoubtedly revolve around the Vatican in the days and weeks ahead, just as they did after the death of Pope John Paul I in 1978, 33 days after his election. There are already speculations that something was about to come out about Benedict's past. The Vatican will reject these notions with contempt in the same way that can be predicted. But they are understandable anyway, because the transcendental importance of what Benedict has done cannot be overstated.
From St.Peter's Basilica, Julia Rochester of London, who described herself as an expired Catholic, was still turning to the implications of the Pope's resignation. “If you are God’s chosen one, how do you choose not to be chosen?” he thought. It is a question that many practicing Catholics will be asking their priests in the coming weeks. In his first address as Pope, humbly renouncing his aptitude for the task, Benedict said: “I am comforted by the fact that the Lord knows how to work and how to act, even with insufficient tools”. Apparently, at some point in the last eight years, he stopped believing that was true.

"Austrian director Michael Haneke took home the prestigious Palme d'Or award -- his second -- at the Cannes Festival for his film Amour.
The film, according to the festival website, is about a retired couple in their 80s and how their link is severely tested after the woman, Anne, has an attack. It features actors Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva.
Haneke also won the Palme d'Or at the 2009 festival for The White Ribbon. That film described the cruel punishments inflicted in a German rural school before World War I.
The Palme d'Or is the best prize a filmmaker can win, Haneke said at a press conference after his 2009 award. I'm not proud, but I'm very happy. In my opinion, it's silly to be proud.
Another top prize candidate was Moonrise Kingdom, a Wes Anderson film that tells the story of two young lovers who gather and flee to the desert in 1965 after a year of difference.
The film stars Bruce Willis, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton and Ed Norton along with Anderson's favorite Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman. But it is the two young lovers, portrayed by newcomers Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward, who steal the show.
My point of view on that was the memory of feeling that way so strong for me, Anderson told CNN earlier this week. Instead of starting with an idea of a character or characters and a stage, instead of starting with a feeling. An emotion. A memory of an emotion I hoped to recreate in some way.
Photos of the 65th Cannes Film Festival
Moonrise Kingdom was one of a handful of American films in the 22-person competition section. Others included John Hillcoat's movement in the age of prohibition Lawless, with Shia LaBoeuf, Gary Oldman and Guy Pearce; Andrew Dominick's thriller killing them gently with Brad Pitt; Lee Daniels The Paperboy with Zac Efron, Matthew McConaughey and Nicole Kidman. Also presented was Jeff Nichols Mud with McConaughey and Reese Witherspoon and the adaptation Don DeLillo by David Cronenberg Cosmopolis starting Robert Pattinson from Twilight Fama and Juliette Binoche.
In addition, Kanye West also premiered a short film/art installation, Cruel Summer, at the festival, which began on May 16. He is the star of Kid Cudi as a car thief who falls in love with a blind Arab princess, but West also makes an appearance.
And the start of British rock Pete Doherty, the lead singer of the Libertines, also made his debut as an actor in the Confession of a Child of the Century, which was screened at the festival.
Last year's Palme d'Or award went to The Tree of Life, a film by American director and writer Terrence Malick.

"""Go ahead, make my day"" is one of the most famous movie lines ever spoken in Hollywood history. The actor was Clint Eastwood, and the film was the sudden impact of 1983. Eastwood's words became an instant phrase that many Americans can recite to this day. Eastwood is possibly the epitome of the American male. He has icon status among men for portraying the tough guy in almost all of his films.

Eastwood was born in 1930 in San Francisco before arriving in Los Angeles at an early age. He briefly attended Los Angeles City College, but soon abandoned his acting career. After appearing in a couple of low-budget movies, Eastwood got his big shot on the old West Rawhide TV. His character Rowdy Yates was an instant celebrity, and he launched Eastwood's incredible career. Eastwood first exploded on the big screen with his roles in three Western films in the 1960s. The so-called Spaghetti Westerns, who were named for their ties to Italian cinema, were very successful, and made Eastwood a family name.
Eastwood continued his success with a series of films that is incomparable in Hollywood history. He starred in Harry the Dirty's very popular franchise, where, once again, he played the tough guy. In this series, Sucio Harry is a San Francisco police officer who takes the matter into his own hands. This bothers your endless superiors, but Harry always wins. This person delighted the audience of American films, especially men.
The performance wasn't the only talent Eastwood would show over time. He also became an Oscar winning director. Probably, his best film as director was Million Dollar Baby, but it's hard to pick a movie from his impressive list of movies. He is still active in cinema at the age of 74.",B2
"A passenger aboard Continental Airlines Flight 1404 described a panic scene as the plane slid off the runway while attempting to take off and caught fire on Saturday at Denver International Airport in Colorado.
Passenger Gabriel Trejos says he saw a burning engine when the plane stopped.
Everyone was trying to get off the plane, passenger Gabriel Trejos told CNN KUSA subsidiary. Everyone was screaming, the plane is going to explode, the plane is going to explode!'
Only one of the 38 people taken to hospitals was in serious condition and none seemed to be burned, said Patrick Hynes, chief of the Denver Fire Department airport division. Bone fractures and bruises were the most common complaint, he said.
Trejos said that when the plane fell to the ground, he saw a burning engine and seats crouching towards each other.
“The plane seemed to take forever to stop,” Trejos said. On my side of the plane I could see the engine, I realized it was on fire. I could feel the heat coming from the window. Look Trejos describe seeing the engine in the fire
Airport officials said it was too early to determine the cause of the accident or fire.
The flight was headed for Houston, Texas, and took off around 6:20 p.m.
Firefighters found Boeing 737 on fire, with its wheels sheared, resting in a ravine about 200 meters from the track, Hynes said.
They described a surreal scene when they stopped, heavy fire on the right side of the aircraft, all parachutes deployed from both sides of the aircraft, people evacuating and walking down the slope towards them, Hynes said.
Hynes said the whole right side of the jet was on fire and a big shooting followed him.
There was a significant extension of fire in the part of the cabin, he said. There are significant fire damage inside with the baggage department described as melting and falling into the seats.
Hynes said the plane's fuel leaked for several hours after the accident, but the fire was off.
As far as we know, there were no deaths and we believe there were no critical injuries, Denver International Airport aviation manager Kim Day told reporters on Saturday. Look at the airport official describes the scene of the accident
Continental issued a statement on Saturday saying he was collecting information about the accident. The 112 people on the plane included five crew members.
The aircraft resumed take-offs and landings at the airport after the incident, although Day said a section of the airport will be closed on Sunday. He suggested that passengers call ahead for Sunday departure times, as many flights could be delayed.
A team from the National Transportation Safety Board - LRB- NTSB-RRB- was on their way to the scene to start an investigation.

"Easter is a Christian feast celebrating the resurrection of the dead of Jesus Christ as it is said in the Bible. Christians are in the church at Easter. Some Christians take part in an Easter vigil or evening mass, sometimes in the light of the candles. Easter is never on a set date. It is observed on Sunday between the end of March and the end of April. The exact date is calculated on the basis of a different calendar. Many public schools in the U.S. They have a week's vacation around Easter time. Sometimes this break is called Easter or Spring Holiday.

In the United States, Easter is also celebrated as a secular feast. It is associated with the beginning of spring and symbolized by stuffed bunnies, flowers and eggs. Many children in the United States believe in a fictional character called the Easter Bunny. According to the myth the Easter rabbit leaves baskets full of sweets for the children. Sometimes these baskets are hidden and the children have to find them on Easter Sunday morning. Candy that is usually inside an Easter basket may include chocolate in the form of rabbits or chicks, sweets and marshmallows.
Another activity associated with Easter is an Easter egg hunt. According to popular mythology, the Easter rabbit hides painted eggs and children need to find them. While real eggs used to be used, it is now common to use plastic eggs filled with candy. There are usually public Easter egg hunts in parks across the country. The White House even organizes an Easter egg hunt. Another Easter tradition associated with Easter is to die real eggs in different colors, usually pastries, such as light pink, blue and yellow.

"The 54 men and 14 children rescued after being found chained this week in an Islamic religious school in Pakistan have been reunited with their families or placed in shelters, authorities said.
The group was discovered in an underground room with heavy chains linking them together.
The school, Al-Arabiya Aloom Jamia Masjid Zikirya, which was also a drug rehabilitation clinic, is located in Sohrab Goth, a suburb of Gadap in Karachi.
The 14 children were returned to their families, Senior Police Officer Ahsanullah Marwat told CNN.
Of the adults, 47 had been released to their families, and seven had been handed over to a homeless shelter, he said.
Three people working at the facility were arrested, but the four men running the site were still at large, Marwat said.
Officials said that the facility was part of Madrassah and part of the drug rehabilitation center, and the captives were chained at night apparently to prevent their escape.
The operation was successful, and we plan to continue our work to ensure that places like this are closed, Marwat said.
Many of the captives told the police that their families sent them there because they were recovering the drug addicts. During the day, they worked and did religious studies.
But the future of the rescued children was unclear.
One woman told a local television station that she was willing to pay the police to support her troubled child. He said he would prefer the facility to remain open, regardless of how it treated children.
Many others, however, said they were shocked and unbelieving about the accusations.
One man complained that he was heavily indebted after paying the school a lot of money to approach his son.

"The Williams sisters continued their march towards more Olympic success with three victories among them in London on Monday.
The fourth seed Serena became the third round of the female singles with a 6-2 6-3 victory over the Polish Ursula Radwanska, whose older sister Agnieszka won her fifth Wimbledon title earlier this month.
The American will face the thirteenth Russian seed Vera Zvonareva, who knocked out the 2010 French Open champion Francesca Schiavone.
Zvonareva, the bronze medalist in Beijing four years ago, triumphed 6-3 6-3.
They were difficult conditions, a little windy. “I am glad I could make it,” Williams said, facing a possible quarter finale against the previous world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki or the Slovak Daniela Hantuchova while searching for the only important title missing in her collection.
His older brother Venus, who is in the same middle of the draw, bounced from his first departures at the French Open and Wimbledon by beating runner-up Roland Garros Sara Errani 6-3 6-1 in his delay in the first round match.
Another gold medal would be incredible, said the 32-year-old, who won the singles title in 2000 along with the doubles, which she and Serena won again in 2008.
I can't even imagine the feeling, I think my head would be too big and nobody would like it more. I have to get there first, I have two chances and I'll go get it.
Venus will play Canadian Aleksandra Wozniak, who progressed in the second round by winning 6-2 6-1 against New Zealand's Marina Erakovic.
If he wins that game, Williams will play the seventh German seed Angelique Kerber or Timea Babos of Hungary for a place in the quarterfinals.
That could mean a clash of the last eight with the world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka, who survived a second set of fear to defeat Romanian Irina-Camelia Begu 6-1 3-6 6-1 in her inaugural match at Centre Court.
The Belarusian, who lost to Serena in the Wimbledon semifinals, will face María José Martínez Sánchez of Spain.
Serena and Venus also won their opening doubles match, beating Sorana Cirstea and Simona Halep 6-3 6-2 from Romania to establish a clash with Kerber and Sabine Lisicki.
Lisicki also went on to the second round of the singles, coming from behind to beat Tunisian teenager Ons Jabeur, who took 297th place, and secure a match against Yaroslava Shvedova of Kazakhstan.
The winner of that tie will probably face the world No. 3 Maria Sharapova, who plays Laura Robson of Great Britain.
Old World No. 1s Kim Clijsters and Ana Ivanovic will meet in the third round, while the sixth Czech seed Petra Kvitova, whose defense Wimbledon was finished by Serena Williams in the quarterfinals, will face Flavia Pennetta from Italy.

"New Year's Day officially begins as soon as people shout ""Happy New Year"" at midnight. Most people still party well after midnight in the early hours of the first day of the new year. In fact, many New Year's parties include breakfast or brunch. Sometimes at midnight there will be fireworks and couples often kiss. One of the most famous New Year's celebrations takes place in New York's Time Square, where a huge cut crystal ball falls at midnight in front of millions of people standing in the cold. Many millions more watch on TV. Some groups, called Polar Bear Clubs, jump into the cold ocean water on New Year's Day as a literal way to start the fresh New Year.

New Year's Day, January 1, is a national holiday in the United States. This means that schools, banks, government offices and post offices are closed. Given the number of people who tend to drink alcohol on New Year’s Eve, many people wake up on New Year’s Day with hangover. The national holiday is a good day to recover.
Many people party with their friends on New Year's Eve; many people use New Year's Day to visit their family. New Year's Day is also when many people start with their New Year resolutions. A resolution is a promise to change a lifestyle habit. The most common resolution is to lose weight. Many people also join the gyms as part of their resolutions.
On New Year's Day there are also parades such as the famous Rose Parade Tournament in Pasadena, California, where all floats are made of roses of different colors and compete for prizes. Many people also watch professional and college football matches, including the Rose Bowl, which is also held in Pasadena, California.

Wait, Andrew.
Good. What's going on?
Tomorrow is Caroline's birthday.
Oh, yeah, that's right!

And I'm working late.
So...
Could you pick up a present today?

I just had an idea for a present.
Come on.
New headphones?
Nah. Jeremy said he was getting his headphones.

"Over the years, the Memorial Day weekend has become largely something that was originally not meant to be:
Seventy-two hours of barbecues and ball games, swimming pool openings, high decibel sales pitches by traders in hopes of charging at the unofficial start of summer.
Which, to some extent, is understandable. The climate is becoming warm, there is a sense of vacation for rest from work, and solemnity and mourning for those who gave their lives in search of peace seems sometimes to be cast aside.
But the search for peace, with all its contradictions and all its sacrifices, remains the centerpiece of the Day of Commemoration.
And this weekend might be worth stopping, if only for a moment, to reflect on a quote that has been attributed in various ways to Winston Churchill and George Orwell:
We sleep deeply in our beds because tough men are ready at night to visit violence over those who would hurt us.
Throughout history, peace in the world has often been achieved, by necessity, by the most brutal means available during military conflicts. There is an intrinsic dichotomy to wars that are waged in search of peace, an uncomfortable gap between lightness and shadows. Tranquility is born of bloodshed; happiness is the end result of horror. We don't like to think about it too much, and it's no wonder. The truth behind it goes against our best nature.
What is the most beloved image celebrating the happy end of World War II?
It's Alfred Eisenstaedt's picture of the sailor and nurse hugged in Times Square. Even now, more than 60 years later, that photo makes people cry with joyous emotion, makes them smile with exultation throughout generations. That photo, often declares, says it all.
But there would be no picture of the sailor and nurse except for the scenes that no one likes to see in the photographs: the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that put an end to the terrible years of war. It is perfectly explicable that we prefer to bathe in exuberant images of the first hours of peace, rather than the appalling images of the last hours of war.
One person who was present during the last hours of World War II was Paul Tibbets. During the many days and nights I spent with him during the last years of his life, there were times when the conversation focused on that picture of the sailor and nurse. Sometimes, when we traveled together and he attended a military meeting, someone approached him with a copy of the photo.
Paul would never say anything. He looked at me and just raised his eyebrows, almost imperceptibly. He wasn't the photographer, but Eisenstaedt wouldn't have had anything to photograph if it wasn't for him.
It was the man -- the military aviator -- assigned by the U.S. government to arm, in no way secret, the unity that would be carried out by atomic raids in Japan. When the day came, he did not delegate; he flew the B-29 called Enola Gay, his mother's name, to Hiroshima with a goal in mind: to stop the war. Let the soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines go home at last, to reunite with their families or to form new families, in order to somehow, after all the suffering and all the broken heart, find peace.
Of course, the sailor and nurse are the favorite visual representation of victory. What Paul Tibbets, sailor Dutch Van Kirk, bomber Tom Ferebee and his crew were invited to do about the skies of Japan is something that is hard to think about for many people; it is much nicer to smile at the kiss in New York.
Peace is the result starred by the sun, but getting there can be a path of darkness over darkness. Therefore, on the weekend of Memory Day, it is probably reasonable for some people to turn back thoughtfully from the thoughts of the battlefields and death. The people who turn away are not usually those whose family members have walked that dark and lonely path in times of war.
On occasions throughout the centuries when long wars have come to an end, many newspapers have chosen to go with the most glorious title of a single word, all letters of capital of all:
PEACE!
Is there a word in English that is more welcome, more appreciated? That is more likely to be received with joy and prayer relief by all who see it? Almost every desire a person, or a nation, can have is embodied in that syllable.
All the lightness and all the shadows, all the wars fought at terrible costs, all in search of peace. Reaching such a state of harmony has never been a peaceful journey.
That's why the word is so beautiful, so longed for:
Because it sounds so simple while it stays so weird.
The views expressed in this commentary are only those of Bob Greene.

"Chanuka, which can also be spelled as Hanukkah, is an 8-day Jewish holiday. It is known as the Feast of Lights, which celebrates the dedication of an ancient Jewish temple in Jerusalem thousands of years ago. According to the Hebrew, or Jewish, Bible, then a miracle occurred. A one-day oil supply miraculously lasted eight days. Hanukkah dates always change, but usually occur anywhere at the end of November at the end of December.

The main way to observe the holidays is to light a candle in a candlestick, a special candle holder with space for 9 candles in each of the 8 nights. This candlestick is called menorah. Now there are also electric menorahs. Some people also use oil lamps. The ninth candle space is generally higher than the others and lights up every night. This ninth candle is there so people can see the other candles they're lighting. So, two lights go on on the first night, three on the second and so on. Some families have the head of the house light the candles. Other families share responsibility. The menorah is supposed to be placed somewhere visible like in a window facing the street. The candles are supposed to remain lit at least 30 minutes after dark. There are also special prayers that people say and holy songs sung when the candles are lit.
Schools and government offices are open to Hanukkah as celebrations take place at night. Some families exchange gifts every night of the holiday. Some foods traditionally eaten in Hanukkah include latkes, potato pancakes and doughnuts. These and other fried foods are eaten because they are cooked in oil and remind people of the oil that lasted 8 nights. Children play with a special four-sided spin called dreidel.",B2
"In the central square, there was once an orgy of music, street dancing and unparalleled fun for any other nation in the Americas, Haitians say.
But where there was joy now lies a vast settlement of people without loved ones, without homes, without belongings of life.
Haitians have celebrated Carnival through dictatorships, military coups and bloodshed. The popular belief was that if a government failed to comply with Carnival, Haiti’s equivalent to Mardi Gras would surely fall, said Marie Laurence Lassegue, Haiti’s minister of culture and information.
But this year, the three-day festival has been cancelled, another indication of the enormity of the earthquake's devastation.
The musicians shut up, the seamstresses stopped sewing costumes and the ghost skeletons of unfinished floats lay scattered outside Port-au-Prince. One month after the devastating January 12 earthquake, the Champs de Mars square is home to the displaced people of the capital, where thousands of people have taken out a small space in which to survive.
Full coverage of the aftermath of the earthquake
This is the first time Carnival is not happening, said Roberto Martino, lead singer of the popular Kompa T-Vice band. I don't even think about music anymore.
Less than a week before the start of Carnival on Sunday, the fun is replaced by mourning. The nation's leading concert producer, Charles Jubert, died. So did the members of four bands who were practicing inside a studio that collapsed. Other musicians lost legs, arms and hands. They won't be able to play again.
“I don’t think we have time to think about Carnival,” Lassegue said. Maybe when we're done crying.
The three days of liberation and celebration of Carnival have an enormous importance in the lives of Haitians, Lassegue said. But this year? I don't even remember when it is.
Instead, the displaced are planning days of prayer.
“We are living in a city that is like a cemetery,” said Ronide Baduel, a nurse who lost her home and all her belongings in the earthquake. His brother died and suddenly found himself far from his middle-class existence, relegated to an improvised shop and burlap bags he used for pillows at night.
I had four good walls all around me. Now I have four sheets, he said. She's going to work with a big black fake leather bag that contains toothpaste, soap and a change of underwear. There, she can bathe properly.
“We do not know how many days, how many months, how long we will be like this,” he said. I'm always stressed out. It's like living in a jungle. How can I dance at Carnival?
Baduel and his neighbors in the shopping community said that the money that would have been spent on Carnival should be used to build houses.
Very close, the 44 members of Relax Band, who were usually revolutionizing their street performances in the days before Carnival, were concerned about their next meal.
They played Sunday before the earthquake, marching through the streets, preparing for the great performance. Now, everything was gone, including all of his instruments that were crushed when the band's coordinator Ernst Beauvaishouse collapsed.
A small setting with the red and white logo of Relax Band now houses a huge tank of water bladder dropped by a help group and mattresses to sleep under the stars.
“It is one of the greatest tragedies in our country,” Beauvais said, pointing to the rubble of his home. He said it was the band's 30th anniversary; the musicians were looking forward to showing their new song. Almost all bands in Haiti debut new pieces at Carnival.
Outside the city, the skeletons of three floaters feel like ghosts, reminders of what might have come next week.
One of the floaters belongs to T-Vice.
Bandmates Roberto Martino and Eddy Viau would have been practicing with the rest of the band for their performance at Carnival... it's an honor to win the first prize.
“If you have a good show at Carnival, you are ready for the rest of the year,” Martino said. This year, the band had planned a football program with a song called The End of the Match.
Instead, it recently launched Nou Pap Lage - LRB- We Won't Give Up -RRB-, dedicated to earthquake victims.
iReport: Looking for loved ones in Haiti
Martino tried to sing a few verses. There are so many things going through my head, he said. Overtaken by emotion, he had to compose and start again.
People say Haiti is finished, but no, no, no, we'll get up, he sang softly. We'll do our best. We will rebuild Haiti. We'll stick together.
Don't get discouraged. There will be light at the end of the tunnel. My Haitian people. I won't let him go.
The revenue from the song downloads goes to the non-profits Sow A Seed and MedShare. Music, Martino said, was so essential to Haitian life. But I didn't know when this weird silence would end; when I would be able to write lyrics, put them to the melody.
We're all so traumatized, he said. Carnival, he said, was Haiti's musical showcase. We've lost our greatest tradition. Carnival was part of us.

"On one of the most famous avenues in New York City, Fifth Avenue, is Museum Mile. Museum Mile is a 23 block stretch that houses some of the most famous museums in the world. Museum Mile starts on 85th Street and Fifth Avenue with the huge Metropolitan Museum of Art. There are thousands of years of art and artifacts inside. A visitor can visit an entire Egyptian tomb, sit in a Japanese-style garden, see Renaissance paintings and ancient Greek and Roman sculptures. There's even a gallery with musical instruments. In summer, there is a rooftop garden where there are spectacular views of the city, especially the Central Park.

The Guggenheim, on 88th Street and Fifth Avenue, looks a little like a snail shell from the outside. When it opened in the 1950s, the swirling architecture, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, was considered ugly by many. This museum focuses on modern art, but sometimes presents special exhibitions as one they had a few years ago of ancient Mexican ruins. The National Museum of the Academy and the School of Fine Arts on 91st Street and Fifth Avenue is the oldest school of art in the city, dating from 1825. The Jewish Museum on 93rd Street and Fifth Avenue, tells 4,000 years of Jewish history. Ten blocks from 103rd Street and Fifth Avenue is the New York City Museum, showing the history of the Big Apple since its colonial beginning.
One block from 104th Street and Fifth Avenue is El Museo del Barrio. This museum began as a space to reflect the great community of Puerto Rican migrants in the city. It now has exhibitions focused on art throughout Latin America. On the other side of the avenue is the Central Park Conservatory Garden, with a fountain that has a sculpture of three women dancing of life size.",B2
"Canadian tennis player Frank Dancevic beat Australian Open organizers for forcing players to compete in “inhuman” conditions after it collapsed on the court while temperatures rose to 41C.
Dancevic, who collapsed during the second set of his first round against Frenchman Benoît Paire on track discovered six in Melbourne Park and collapsed for a minute, said the conditions were clearly dangerous for players. He also said the heat had made him hallucinate: “I was dizzy from the middle of the first set and then I saw Snoopy and I thought, ‘Wow, Snoopy – that’s weird. '""
“I think it’s inhuman. I don’t think it’s fair for anyone – for players, for fans, for sport – when you see players break out of games, faint,” he added. “I’ve played five set games all my life and being out there for a set and a half and fainting with a heat stroke, it’s not normal.
“Having players with so many problems and complaining about the tournament is too hot to play; until someone dies, they simply go ahead with it and putting matches in this heat. I personally don’t think it’s fair and I know that many players don’t think it’s fair.”
Other participants generally agreed. Number one Britishman, Andy Murray, said: “It’s definitely something to look at. As easy as it is to say that conditions are safe, it only takes one bad thing to happen. And it looks terrible for the whole sport when people are collapsing, the guys in the ball are collapsing, the people in the stands are collapsing. That's not great.
“I know that when I went out to strike before the match, the conditions between 2.30 and 3 p.m. were very, very harsh. Whether it's safe or not, I don't know. There have been some problems in other sports with players with heart attacks.”
Caroline Wozniacki said: “I put the bottle of water on the court and started melting a little under the plastic. So, you know it was warm.
John Isner, who retired from his first round match with a right ankle injury, said: “It was like an oven when I open the oven and the potatoes are made. That’s how it is.”
defending champion Victoria Azarenka took the same line. “It felt really hot, like you were dancing in a frying pan or something,” he said.
The tournament’s “extreme heat” contingency plan was put into effect for women’s matches on Tuesday, allowing for an additional ten-minute break between the second and third sets. However, under a change in the rules for 2014, the decision on whether to stop matches in the tournament is now at the discretion of the tournament director, Wayne McKewen. Instead of using Celsius raw readings to assess heat, organizers prefer to use the wet bulb balloon temperature compound, which also measures humidity and wind to identify perceived conditions. Organizers said temperatures peaked at 42.2C in the early morning of Tuesday and conditions had never reached the point where the game would stop. “We have to reach a minimum threshold and have a forecast that it will remain for a reasonable time,” McKewen said in a statement. “That didn’t happen. While the conditions were warm and uncomfortable, the relatively low level of humidity ensured that the game would continue.”
Dancevic, who said he had felt dizzy since the middle of the second set, resumed after medical attention, but, as expected, ended up losing 7-6, 6-3, 6-4. “It was very close to stopping completely,” he said. “I wasn’t running too far toward the end. I wasn’t tired; I just felt that my body temperature was too high.”
A boy from the ball had previously required medical attention after collapsing during the victory of Milos Raonic 7-6, 6-1, 4-6, 6-2 over Daniel Gimeno-Traver on the equally exposed eight court and the tournament shortened the rotations for the boys from the ball to 45-minute shifts. Peng Shuai of China also said that the heat had made him twist and vomit, and had to be helped by the court after his defeat of 7-5, 4-6, 6-3 to Kurumi Nara of Japan. Officials played with health risks, saying that most of the matches were completed without calling for medical attention.
“Of course, there were some players who experienced heat-related illness or discomfort, but none required significant medical intervention after completing their match,” said Tim Wood, the tournament’s medical director, in a statement.
Most of the competitors, however, followed Roger Federer's line which, although the conditions were difficult, were the same for both players. “It’s just a mental thing,” the Swiss said, although before Dancevic collapsed. “If you’ve trained enough your whole life, or the last few weeks, and you think you can do it and get over it, there’s no reason. If you can’t deal with it, throw away the towel.”
Dancevic disagreed. “I don’t think it has much to do with the way players are. Some players are used to heat – their bodies can genetically handle heat and others’ can’t,” he said. “It’s dangerous to be out there; it’s dangerous. An hour and a half ago since my game and I still can’t pee.”

"The roof is plastic supported by a crooked tree trunk and desks just a gypsum of plaster chairs, but students within the Chemin des Dunes school are studying with the same intensity as they would be at a seminar at Oxford University. The hope of a new life in France is at stake.
“The French language is very difficult, but we work hard. If we come every day, we may be able to touch our dreams,” says Kamal, a Darfurian refugee devastated by the war in Sudan who comes to three or four hours of class every day. “It’s a good thing to keep your brain active.”
The 29-year-old electrical engineer is one of the tens, perhaps hundreds, of refugees living in the “jungle” camp outside Calais who have applied for asylum in France and are eager to learn the language of what they expect to be their new home.
Like many of his fellow students, he is frustrated that the media coverage of the extensive villa-shop has focused only on those who use it as a rally for risky night deals to board trucks or trains across the canal.
“I have to tell people in the UK that they think everyone wants to go there. But there are many people here who want to stay in France,” Kamal said.
According to United Nations data, France already has more than a quarter of a million refugees; the country has hosted more than twice as many as the United Kingdom, despite the fact that countries have similar populations.
There are another 56,000 asylum seekers waiting for their asylum application to be processed in a French safe haven, the second highest in Europe, while in the UK there are 36,000.
Although applicants await a response, France does not provide them with any financial support or allow them to work, and the slow process may take many months. The jungle camp offers a free meal a day and a plastic roof over their heads so many decide to endure basic conditions for a few more months, rather than potentially endangering their offer of asylum by working illegally.
The idea of the school was first promoted by some of that group at the beginning of the summer, when they were bored of sitting waiting and nervous about starting a new life in France totally unable to communicate. It was a reality in a few weeks, which opened on July 11.
“We did it to bring together the ‘brothers’ and, at the same time, they can learn French,” said Zimarco Jones, the Nigerian founder of the school, who arrived in Calais in 2013 and is still waiting for his asylum application to be processed. “Now, we have to build another,” he says with a smile.
In its most crowded classroom, the small classroom has 30 students, piled up in five rows of desks in front of a large green slate and pictures of cartoon animals for each letter of the French alphabet. There are also English, art and t’ai chi classes, but the most attractive are French classes, taught by volunteers from Calais and beyond.
“French isn’t as easy as English, but two weeks ago I decided there was no way to get to the UK,” says George, another Darfur refugee and dedicated student. He wanted to cross the Canal because he speaks English fluently but, with language classes, he says he is happy to settle in France.
“Anywhere there is peace, I can stay, there’s no problem,” he says, already waiting in the classroom for more than half an hour before his teachers arrive.
He admits that he doesn't know much about France, but he says the classes help him gradually to understand the country, as well as the language.
Many of the volunteers in the jungle school are local teachers who are giving up their summer vacation.
Jenny Flahaut, 33, who works in a children's home, was inspired to volunteer after seeing an ad on Facebook. “I saw these people in Calais every day and wanted to do something for them,” he said.
She is particularly frustrated by the representation of migrants in the media and by politicians who have never visited the countryside, most recently David Cameron, the British Prime Minister, who in a highly criticized speech spoke of “heating” of people trying to get to the UK.
“They don’t know them and they have a bad vision, but they’re not,” Flahaut said as he prepared for an afternoon lesson. “Most of them are very good people. They're cozy and friendly. They want to improve their lives and improve them, and learning is part of that.”
The teachers and Zimarco now focus on creating a separate classroom to cater for about 200 women and two dozen children. Women are outnumbered by about ten to one by men in Calais camp and most feel uncomfortable attending classes with male students they don't know, say volunteers.
When this ends, the former hotel worker whose work takes the school off the ground is remembered in his unofficial name – everyone in the camp simply calls it “the school of Zimarco” – has more dreams to make the camp a place to live, not just survive. He wants to set up a football team for migrants, explains through an instant cappuccino in the immaculate shop he calls home, and even dreams of changing the name of the camp. He hates “the jungle” because it implies that residents are not people.
“We have a discotheque, a house, a mosque, a school, shops,” he says. “We are not animals.”

"The director of a local university has asked him to write a report on the advantages and disadvantages of working abroad on summer holidays. He would like to know if the university should recommend ""work holidays"" to its students.
A report on students' experiences of working abroad
Introduction
Currently, approximately 25% of Hawthorne College students work abroad during summer holidays. This report aims to show the benefits and disadvantages of working abroad to decide whether the university should recommend the experience to its students.
In preparing this report, a sample of 100 students was interviewed, 23 of whom had worked abroad. This is a summary of his remarks.
Benefits
According to the students interviewed, working abroad during summer holidays can bring several benefits. Above all, students can improve their language skills by working in a non-English speaking country. This can help them get a better job in the future. In addition, learning about a different culture and way of life makes people more open-minded. Another advantage is that students can be more confident when learning practical skills to help them live independently later in life, for example, finding accommodation and cooking for themselves.
Inconvenient
However, a large number of respondents also mentioned drawbacks. Students who need to study during the summer will have difficulty doing so while working abroad. Most important of all are financial issues: only a minority of students can afford travel, accommodation and visa expenses. In addition, students may have to accept low-income jobs if they do not master the local language, so they may have difficulty covering their expenses.
Conclusion and recommendation
Working abroad can improve the language skills and confidence of students. However, students often need to earn money during vacation to support their studies and work abroad may not provide the opportunity to save. In addition, the cost of travel means that only students who are able to pay for it have the opportunity to do this. Therefore, the university should only recommend working abroad if there is financial support from the university for students who need it.",B2
"An atmosphere of melancholy and changing times permeates the opening to the final series of Downton Abbey. The year is 1925 and there are already the first noises of economic storms that will ravage the end of the decade. Neighbors are selling their own stately home, while Lord Grantham tries to trim the servants after declaring that the underdogs are no longer affordable.
But in the true abbey of Downton, the castle of Highclere – a stately house owned by George “Geordie” Herbert, eighth Count of Carnarvon – the financial perspectives have rarely been brighter. According to Lady Fiona Carnarvon, Downton's huge global success has funded a renewable building repair program designed to safeguard Highclere for the next generation.
“It’s been an amazing magic carpet ride for all of us,” he said. “It has given us a wonderful marketing platform, an international profile. I'm extremely grateful. My husband and I love the house, and the people here. Now, without a doubt, he is loved by millions of people.”
Currently, only the ground and first floors of Highclere are used at the borders of Hampshire. However, a project has been initiated to restore the rooms of the abandoned towers that will eventually allow visitors to climb to the tower to an exhibition showing the work of the architect of the Houses of Parliament, Sir Charles Barry, who rebuilt the house between 1839 and 1842.
When Downton Abbey producers first approached Highclere in 2009, the family faced a repair bill of nearly £12 million, with an urgent labour price of £1.8 million. But, by 2012, the Downton effect had begun to remove the pressure. Lord Carnarvon then said: “It was just after the banking crisis and it was gloomy in all directions. We'd been doing corporate functions, but everything got pretty thin after that. Then Downton arrived and became an important tourist attraction.”
The number of visitors doubled, to 1,200 a day, as Downton Abbey, written by Julian Fellowes, came to be projected around the world after becoming a success in the UK in 2010 and then in the United States. It is currently broadcast in 250 countries. The policy of ticket sales, which was previously a basic one, has become a computer-based early reservation system, which helps to guarantee the admission of foreign visitors. Highclere Enterprises accounts for 2014-15 show that current assets have nearly tripled to around £1m since 2012. Gareth Neame, the executive producer of the series, said, “I think Downton Abbey secured Highclere’s future.”
Peter Fincham, ITV's television director, remembers the moment Highclere was booked. ""I thought, 'So what? 'Cause I've never heard of Highclere Castle. One stately house looks just like the other. How wrong I was. The castle has also been a huge character.
Downton tourists are part of a growing phenomenon. VisitBritain estimates that almost 30% of foreign visitors, or nearly nine million people, include castles and historic houses in their itineraries. Nearly half of potential visitors to Britain now say they want to enjoy the “stage ” and visit places that appear in movies or on television. More than a million embark on a tour of historic buildings each year, spending more than £1 billion. From the largest emerging tourist markets, 51% of Brazilians, 42% of Russians and Chinese, and 35% of Indian visitors are likely to include a visit to a site of interest in their travels. VisitBritain’s director, Patricia Yates, said: “The links between tourism, film and television are powerful.” He added that the dramas of the time have also increased the popularity of regions outside London.
Neame is now the ambassador of the great British campaign, which is supported by government departments and the British Council, using it to promote the United Kingdom around the world. Events include special Downton theme receptions at British embassies.
Neame said: “They approached me by reach. A lot of people here think of it as soapy entertainment. In other parts of the world, people venerate our actors, our talent for writing and production. It's something I'm passionate about; I'm a very strong believer in soft power. We are not as proud of our achievements as we should be.
“The Downton Abbey is iconic to express the British. Really, it's a fantasy world, based on a particular moment in history. It is the first drama of the television period that has really jumped off the screen and become part of popular culture.”
Lady Carnarvon is still interested in emphasizing that Highclere's long-term future is not necessarily safe. “The conclusion is pretty thin,” he said. “The program has allowed us to spend faster on buildings, restore madness.”
In the pipeline there is an event of the centenary of Tutankhamon in 2022, 100 years after the fifth Count of Carnarvon, along with Howard Carter, discovered the tomb that revolutionized our understanding of Egyptology. Another opportunity to keep Highclere in the public mind is the 300th anniversary of the birth of Lancelot “Capacity” Brown, who designed the grounds.
What you do is never sit on your laurels. Every day, don’t take anything for granted,” said Lady Carnarvon. “For all these big houses, you have to invest in them. And, there's been a deficit since the 1930s. Perhaps, in the past, a farm and a house defined and supported the family and their lifestyle but, today, it is quite the opposite: the challenge is how Geordie and I seek to support and care for Highclere.
“From my point of view, I have tried to persuade people that it’s fun and to have specific events with which they can participate, not just a stroll through a dusty house. We have to compete with attractions like the London Dungeon.”

"""Look in the sky! It's a bird; it's a plane. No. It's Superman!"" This is one of the most emblematic lines in the history of television. This marked the beginning of a new episode of Superman's Adventures. The program of the 1960s is just one of a series of shows, plays, films and comics that represent the ""Man of Steel"". The most iconic actor who portrayed Superman was Christopher Reeve. Reeve starred in four films during the 1970s and 1980s.

In the 1978 classic movie Superman, Reeve was chosen as the legendary American hero based largely on his physical attributes, although he was an accomplished actor. Reeve had the classic Superman look. He was 6'4"" tall, he weighed 215 pounds, with a square jaw, and other manly features that made him perfect for paper. The film won critical praises and several awards, including a ""Special Award for Visual Effects"". One of the points of sale of the film was that the special effects were so good that the audience would believe that a man could fly after watching this film.
Reeve went on to star in three sequels to the original film, and had a very solid acting career in several films after that. Tragically, Reeve and his family were beaten with a devastating blow on 27 May 1995. Reeve was riding his horse through a course of bells jumping over obstacles. His horse suddenly stopped, throwing Reeve to the ground. Reeve suffered broken vertebrae, and instantly lost the use of his arms and legs.
Reeve refused to surrender. He spent the rest of his years advocating for the advancement of spinal cord injury in treatment and technology. He used his celebrity status to help the cause, but unfortunately, Reeve died at the age of 52 in 2004 due to the complications of his injuries. He will always be remembered to his fans as the Man of Steel.",B2

In February 2009, Obama was in an event room in Fort Myers, Florida, launching his stimulus plan. Rakovich was alone outside the room, speaking against. Therefore, she is considered a kind of godmother of the Tea Party movement.
Nine days after Rakovich's protest, CNBC business reporter Rick Santelli publicly staged his own campaign against the president's $75 billion plan to help struggling homeowners. It happened as Santelli reported live from the Chicago Stock Exchange floor on February 19, 2009.
The government is promoting bad behavior, he said in a diatribe, claiming that all Americans would be forced to subsidize loser mortgages.
The stimulus bill had nothing to do with job creation, Rakovich said in an interview with CNN last summer.
And while opposing government spending, Rakovich relies on one of the largest spending programs, Medicare, to take care of his two bad hips.
“I think there are times when we need the government to have some kind of interim measures to help people get back on their feet,” Rakovich said. Those kind of people need help. I also believe that as a general system, Medicare, as well as Medicaid, are broken systems -- they are systems that need to be revived and renewed.
You know, I'm really glad he was there for me and he'll be there for me.

"Andy Murray's first game since he underwent back surgery in September ended in a consecutive defeat to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at an exhibition tournament in Abu Dhabi Thursday.
The current Wimbledon champion dropped 7-5 6-3 to the Frenchman, who in turn was plagued with injuries at the end of this year.
Murray, he's down to No. 4 in the rankings, lacked sharpness after his dismissal and broke in the 12th game of opening game to stay behind.
The British star has been training at her base in Florida to prepare for the next season and seemed ready to match the match when she won an early interruption of service on the second set.
But Tsonga returned with two breaks to finish the win in 72 minutes at the Zayed Sports City complex.
“The courts here are very fast and you have to react quickly,” Murray, 26, said.
Jo was sharper than me today, he served very well.
It's always fun here. It is a great preparation for the season as you have to play against the best in the world.
The organizers of the Mubadala World Tennis Championship have attracted a stellar field with the two best players, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, in the line-up.
David Ferrer of Spain won the opening match on Thursday when he defeated Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland 7-5 6-1 to organize a semifinal confrontation against compatriot Nadal.
Tsonga's victory over Murray has won him a match against Djokovic of Serbia, while Murray will win the much-needed match practice against Wawrinka in the fifth playoff.
Murray, recently voted for by the BBC Sports Personality of the Year in the UK, became the first British man to win the Wimbledon title in 77 years when he won the All England Club in July, but his season got worse as he was worried about an old back problem.

"On Wednesday at the White House he said he was bewildered by the memoirs of a former spokesman accusing the Bush administration of being mired in propaganda and political twist and sometimes playing with the truth.
Former White House spokesman Scott McClellan attacks President Bush and his advisors in a new book.
In excerpts from a 341-page book to be published on Monday, Scott McClellan writes about the war in Iraq that Bush and his advisers confused the propaganda campaign with the high level of openness and honesty so fundamentally needed to build and then sustain public support during a time of war.
-LSB-I-RSB- in this sense, he was terribly poorly cared for by his senior advisors, especially those directly involved in national security, McClellan wrote.
White House spokesman Dana Perino called McClellan's description of his time in the White House sad. Read excerpts from the book
Scott, now we know, is unhappy with his experience in the White House, Perino said. For those of us who fully support him, before, during and after being press secretary, we are bewildered. It's sad. This isn't the Scott we knew.
McClellan's former colleagues at the White House had harder reactions to McClellan's book.
Frances Townsend, Bush's former national security adviser, said the president's advisors should talk when they have political concerns.
Scott never did that on any of these issues as best I can remember or as best I know from any of my White House colleagues, said Townsend, now a CNN contributor. For him to do this now seems selfish, dishonest and unprofessional.
Fox News contributor and former White House advisor Karl Rove said on that channel Tuesday that excerpts from the book he has read sound more like they were written by a leftist blogger than by his former colleague.
Rove refused to comment on CNN after the Fox News interview.
In a brief telephone conversation with CNN on Tuesday night, McClellan made it clear that he is behind the accuracy of his book. McClellan said he can't make appointments in the registry yet because of an agreement with his publisher. See more details emerge from McClellan's book
Another ex-aide-turned-critic Bush says that his former colleagues' reaction to McClellan's book has a familiar ring to it.
They're saying some of the same things about McClellan that they said about me, Richard Clarke, the former head of the White House against terrorism, told CNN.
Clarke left the government in 2003. The following year, he accused President Bush of ignoring the warnings about the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington and of using the attacks to push for the war with Iraq.
But Clarke gave McClellan little credit for talking now.
I think the difference with McClellan's book is that now he's telling us something that we all know -- that the war with Iraq was a disastrous war -- LSB -- and -- RSB -- was sold with deception. It's a little different when you say something like I did and some other people did it four or five years ago, when the war was popular and when we were unpopular for saying what we said.
In addition to his criticism of how the administration handled the pre-Iraq war period, McClellan also harshly criticized the administration for its management of Hurricane Katrina and its consequences in the book.
One of the worst disasters in the history of our nation became one of the biggest disasters in Bush's presidency, he wrote. Katrina and the failed federal response to it would largely define Bush's second term.
At the beginning of the book, which CNN got at the end of Tuesday, McClellan wrote that he believes he said falsehoods on Bush's behalf in the case of CIA agent Valerie Plame, whose identity leaked to the media.
Rove and his fellow White House advisors Elliot Abrams and I. Lewis Scooter Libby were accused of leaking the name of Plame, whose husband, former U.S. ambassador Joseph Wilson, had gone out to the public on charges that the Bush administration had misrepresented the facts to justify the war in Iraq.
Libby was convicted last year for lying to a grand jury and federal agents investigating the leak. Bush commuted his 30-month prison sentence, calling it excessive. At that time, McClellan called the three good guys and said he spoke to them before telling reporters they were not involved.
He had allowed me to be deceived into passing without knowing a falsehood, he wrote. It would ultimately be fatal to my ability to serve the president effectively.
McClellan wrote that he did not realize what he said was false until reporters began digging up details of the case almost two years later.
A former Bush spokesman when he was governor of Texas, McClellan was appointed White House press secretary in 2003, replacing Ari Fleischer. McClellan had been undersecretary of the press and was the traveling spokesman for the Bush campaign during the 2000 elections.
He announced his resignation in April 2006 at a press conference with Bush.
One of these days, he and I are going to be rocking chairs in Texas talking about the good old days of his time as press secretary, Bush said at that conference. And I can assure you, I'll feel the same way I feel now, that I can tell Scott, I work well done.

"Even in death, peace seemed to elude little Myls Dobson.
On Wednesday night, a week after the severely beaten and burned child was found in the apartment of the woman who cared for him, his body was claimed in the New York morgue.
Authorities said the boy was found unconscious and unanswered on the bathroom floor in The Ritz Plaza, a luxurious skyscraper in Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen section. He was later declared dead in a hospital.
Kryzie King, 27, was charged in connection with the death of the child in Manhattan criminal court on Wednesday.
She has been charged with assault in the first degree, reckless danger in the first degree, danger to the well-being of a child and unlawful imprisonment. A prosecutor told the court last week that King was also being investigated for suspicion of murder and faced additional charges. The indictment will be unsealed on February 5.
In a statement last week, King's lawyer, Bryan Konoski, said: My client is not charged with murder at this time and is presumed innocent of charges against him. I'd tell everyone not to come to any conclusions right now. On Wednesday, Konoski did not return a call for comments.
Mylsfather, Okee Wade, who has a long history of arrest, was imprisoned in New Jersey for conspiracy, theft, and money laundering charges just days after leaving his son with King in mid-December, authorities said. He pleaded not guilty.
The child's mother, Ashlee Dobson, who faced charges of abuse and neglect in both South Carolina and New York before losing custody of Myls in 2011, plans a memorial service for her son in Harlem on Tuesday night.
“We are trying to bury this child with dignity and respect,” said Tony Herbert, a Dobson spokesman.
In the last few weeks of his brief life, Myls suffered unspeakable acts of neglect and violence, according to a criminal complaint.
The child had burn marks and abrasions on the head, neck, face, and testicles, the court papers said. There were bruises and numerous marks made by an object in his abdomen and legs and wrists -- bruises consisting of being restricted -- lacerations on his fingers, abrasions on his armpit, and bruises and scars on his back. The child seemed malnourished, the complaint said.
King told the police that Mylspather left the child to be watched on December 17 and that she was the primary and sole caregiver of the child until the time of his death, the complaint said.
At a press conference on Friday, Herbert said Dobson lost custody of his son for financial reasons. Herbert and Dobson demanded responses from the child welfare authorities.
New York City put the child in the care of the father, who knew he was a criminal, Herbert said. You opened a case and then you shut it down thinking everything was okay? No. That has to be answered. Who did that, who authorized that?
Referring to the child welfare authorities, she added, She was in a shelter, they didn't think it was better that she would be in that shelter with a baby, so they gave it to the father.
David Bookstaver, family court spokesman, said Wednesday that the mother's financial difficulties or staying in a shelter had nothing to do with her loss of custody of the child.
The record reflected serious mental health problems that would have prevented him from taking proper care of the young man, he said. In fact, he consented to the father being Mylscustodian, as did the child ' s lawyer and the Child Services Administration.
At the New York family court hearing, it was mentioned that Ashlee Dobson was arrested after an emergency nurse in a South Carolina hospital detected lacerations on the child and called the police, according to a report from the Colleton County Sheriff's Office, on April 8, 2011.
He told the police that the injuries occurred when Myls encountered traffic in a supermarket parking lot. He said he scratched the boy when he grabbed him and then fell on him, the report said.
When they got up, she said she slapped the kid with a fist closed in her face because she was crazy, the report said.
Dobson told the police that Myls later fell down the stairs and hit his head. Philip Lights, Dobson's attorney, said the case was dismissed after his client accepted advice and treatment under the supervision of child welfare authorities.
Last week, Dobson told reporters that he was turning his life around in hopes of regaining custody of his son. He had weekly visitation rights, but the last time he saw his son was in November.
With tears, he said, I love my son. He always loved me. He always gave me kisses.
The complaint portrays the last few weeks of Mylslife as a living hell.
King, the nanny, told the police that on December 29 she pulled a hot coat rack out of an oven with a glove and allegedly placed it against the child's right leg, leaving marks of linear burns, the complaint said. The next day, he told the police, allegedly hit him five or six times with a belt, leaving bruises and scars.
The complaint said King admitted that between December 30 and January 4, he allegedly tied his wrists and feet with shoelaces and gagged him with a piece of cloth. He told the police that the treatment was scary on his wrists and ankles. The day he was released, according to the complaint, the king allegedly beat him 12 to 13 times with a belt.
On January 7, during sub-freeze temperatures, King told the police that he allegedly locked the child, wearing only a T-shirt and shorts, outside on a balcony from 20 minutes to an hour, the complaint said. That same day, he allegedly locked the child into a dark bathroom for about three hours.
King told the authorities that the child was being very difficult to eat and that the last full meal he ate was December 26, 2013; after that he would only pick up his food, the complaint said. The last time the child ate or drank something was January 3.
Apart from his comments that the child did not eat well, King gave no indication in the complaint of what might have motivated his alleged actions.
After arriving at King's house on December 17, the complaint said, Myls Dobson lost 20 to 25 pounds.
Julie Bolcer, spokesman for the city's medical examiner's office, said an autopsy was performed on Thursday, but cause of death is pending study.
New York Mayor Bill de Blasio called Mylsdead tragic and ordered a full report on what happened later this week.
Every one of these tragedies, it's our job to try to stop, he said. And God forbid that when they happen, it is our job to learn from them and try to do it better and better so that we can reach more children.

"Some of the most majestic views of the landscape in California are the large trees of Sequoia and Redwood of California. These trees can be seen closely in Sequoia National Park, in southern Sierra Nevada, in Visalia. This region of central California has more than 400,000 acres of natural beauty that is uniquely Californian. The park is known as the Land of the Giants due to its beautiful trees. The landscape has large mountains, foothills, deep canyons, a great cave system and, of course, the largest trees in the world.

The park is located next to King's Canyon National Park in the stunning San Joaquin Valley. Sequoia National Park was officially established as a national park in the 1890s. It has 14 campsites that include picnic tables, outdoor cooking fireworks, and food storage boxes. It is a great place for a family holiday with many of its campsites open all year round. But the most popular attractions are its forests. Ancient trees are some of the oldest living organisms on Earth, and attract millions of visitors around the world. Dry trees can reach heights of more than 375 feet. They are closely related to the trees of Sequoia Giante, and are often confused with each other. Both are exceptionally Californians, as they do not grow naturally in any other region of the world.
Dry trees live up to 2,000 years, and have branches that grow up to five feet in diameter. Its bark can grow up to 12 inches thick. The giant trees of Sequoia can live up to 3,000 years, and have branches up to eight feet in diameter. Its bark can grow to an incredible thickness of three feet. Both trees have dark brown bark, and look very similar, but the Secuoya thrives in the coastal climate, while the Secuoya exists in more mountainous areas. In any case, they're a must-have attraction to California.",B2

"Just when the cruise lines thought they could go to quieter waters...
At least 162 passengers and 11 crew members have reported being sick aboard Princess CruisesCaribbean Princess, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The institute said health officers would board the boat in Houston to investigate gastrointestinal disease, which is causing vomiting and diarrhea.
The news follows this week's illness reports on another cruiser, this one on the Royal Caribbean line.
About 700 crew members and passengers fell ill aboard the Royal Caribbean Sea Explorer, the largest number of patients reported on any cruise in two decades, according to CDC data.
That ship returned home on Wednesday, two days earlier than expected.
To compare the cruises, 5.22% of the passengers of the Princess of the Caribbean reported being sick, compared to 20.5% in the Explorer of the Seas.
The outbreak aboard the Caribbean Princess has been confirmed as norovirus, according to Julie Benson, spokesman for Princess Cruises.
Do cruisers float petri dishes?
Noroviruses spread easily and are a common cause of gastroenteritis, which causes vomiting and diarrhea.
Norovirus is also suspected aboard the Sea Explorer, although the cause of the disease has not been confirmed.
The Caribbean Princess is expected to be in Houston early Friday. The seven-day cruise is being cut off for a day.
Sick passengers are asked to stay in their cabins, while staff disinfect public areas, such as bathrooms and lifts.
The decision to cut the short trip was made on the basis of forecasts of heavy fog, not the outbreak, Benson said.
CNN first learned about the Princess's ship ravaged by a Twitter post from the Houston Chronicle.

"Paul Walker's brothers are helping fill small gaps in the unfinished Fast & Furious 7 action sequences before the actor's death, producers said Tuesday.
Walker died in a car accident during a Thanksgiving break in filming last November, forcing a stop to production.
We had to take the time to mourn Paul, the brother we love and lost, and to find out if we should move on with our film, producers wrote fans in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
The decision to resume filming was the only option, the note said. We think our fans want that, and we think Paul would want that, too.
Walker's dramatic scenes were completed before his death, but some action sequences were unfinished, they said.
“We have resumed the shooting and now welcome Paul’s brothers, Caleb and Cody, in our Fast family,” the post said. Caleb and Cody are helping us complete some remaining actions for their brother and fill small gaps left in the production. Having them on the set has made us all feel that Paul is also with us.
The film was to be released this summer, but Universal pushed it on April 10, 2015.
“This film is the most important we have made together,” the post said. It will allow Brian O'Conner's character to live and celebrate Paul in his most defining role.
Walker O'Conner's character is a basic element of the long-term and enormously profitable franchise.
Directed by James Wan, she also stars Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez and Jason Statham.
Walker's Death: The video shows the car burst into flames after 60 seconds
The investigators concluded in a report published in March that speed was the fault of Walker's death.
Investigators determined that the cause of the fatal collision of a single vehicle was an unsafe speed for road conditions, said Mike Parker, L.A. County Sheriff Commander.
The high performance 2005 Porsche Carrera GT was between 80 and 93 mph at the time the car hit a power pole and several trees, the final report said. The speed limit set on the street of the office park of Santa Clarita, California, was 45 mph.
Walker, 40, and his friend Roger Rhodes, 38, had no drugs or alcohol in their blood, the report said. Both men wore seat belts.
Airbags deployed as they should have when the car cut off a light pole and several trees, researchers said. Nothing mechanical went wrong to get the Porsche to leave the road wide. The investigators found no pre-existing conditions that would have caused this collision, the report said.

"Frederick Douglass was born a slave in Talbot County, Maryland, in 1818. His exact date of birth was lost in history. Many African slaves did not register their birth dates on official records during that period because they did not have basic human rights. They were considered the property of their white masters. It was a dark time in the country. Frederick Douglass helped change that.

It was illegal in the southern states to educate blacks at that time, but Douglass was lucky to have been educated by his teacher's wife, who began teaching Douglass the alphabet when he was 12. He continued his education on his own after that. With his new reading skills, Douglass began teaching other black slaves the New Testament. He had a nice owner, who saw no harm in this activity, but his neighbors didn't see him closely. It was not long before the lessons ended, after members of the white community took violent action.
Douglass finally escaped slavery, and settled in the state of Massachusetts, where he began his struggle to end slavery. Douglass became one of the most influential people of his generation. He made powerful friends in the U.S. government. During one of his lecture tours in 1843, Douglass was almost beaten to death by an angry mob, who disagreed with his message of abolition. He fled the country on a couple of occasions to avoid being subjected to slavery again. During his stay in Europe, Douglass spoke with enthusiastic crowds about the evils of slavery.

"No American sports celebrity is as controversial as Lance Armstrong. Armstrong enjoyed years of glory in worshipping the American public during his cycling career for nearly a decade. Between 1999 and 2005, Armstrong won the famous Tour de France road cycling event for seven consecutive years. This is a feat that no other person in the history of the famous race has ever achieved. He was an American hero who benefited greatly from his fame and fortune. During those years, no other athlete in the United States was more popular than Armstrong.

Armstrong was born in 1971 in Plano, Texas. At the age of 12, he had been competing in swimming competitions with great success. At the age of 16, Armstrong began to compete in the exhausting triathlon races, where contestants must ride bicycles, swim and run several kilometers. His Tour de France records were superior to any other racer in the history of the annual event, which began in 1903. However, Armstrong had a dark side.
After he withdrew from the competition in 2011, allegations of drug use began to surface. The United States Anti-Doping Agency began investigating the cyclist, and finally found that he had used performance-enhancing drugs during his years competing in the Tour de France.
Armstrong denied any crime, but the USADA stripped him of his titles. He was also banned from returning to professional competition. This was followed by a lifelong ban by the Cyclist Internationale Union, an international racing organization. Armstrong did not admit drug use until January 2013 at the Oprah Winfrey Show. He claimed that he was not the only athlete who used drugs on the tour, and that he was being selected because of his success. However, that did not matter; this American hero had fallen.",B2
"Much has been said about Kim Kardashian in the weeks leading up to her wedding, and now the reality star is speaking for herself.
The 33-year-old opened on Wednesday on topics ranging from the truth about her wedding dress to racism.
To begin with, she published on May 7, she and fiancé Kanye West are not married yet, despite speculation earlier in the week that the two had secured a marriage license.
They're not filming their next marriages for E either! He keeps up with the Kardashians. You'll see everything you take up and then! Kardashian tweeted. As much as we would love to share these memories on camera, we have decided to keep this close to our heart and share through photos.
There have also been talks about who will come and who will not to the Kardashian-West wedding -- People magazine has indicated that the Kardashian family will be there, but not friends of West Jay Z and Beyonce -- while others have gossiped about the details of Kardashian's wedding dress.
However, according to the reality star, your fans should not believe a word unless you hear it from us.
No guest list has been published. Seeing the fakes, he tweeted. Especially not 1600 guests as I just read. - LRB- The wedding is -RRB- VERY small and intimate. And for the case, she's seen fake photos of my wedding dress. No one's seen my dress! Those pictures are old or Photoshop.
After Kardashian took away those wedding-related thoughts, he turned to a more serious issue: how being the mother of a mixed-race child has affected his understanding of racism.
In a blog titled On My Mind, Kardashian talked about how welcoming the daughter North with West last June is like seeing the world again for the first time, but through someone else's eyes.
It's amazing how a little person and the love I have for her has brought a new meaning to every moment. What once seemed so important, now feels insignificant, he writes. To be honest, before I had the North, I never gave much thought to racism or discrimination. Obviously it's a subject that Kanye is passionate about, but I guess it was easier for me to believe it was someone else's battle.
But with the arrival of his daughter, Kardashian says he is more aware of one side of life that is not always so pretty.
I feel a responsibility as a mother, a public figure, a human being, to do what I can to make sure that not only my son, but all children, do not have to grow up in a world where they are judged by the color of their skin, or their gender, or their sexual orientation, Kardashian concluded. I want my daughter growing up in a world where love is the most important thing.

"Evangelical pastor Ted Haggard described Thursday as a fundamentally true statement that in 2006 he had an inappropriate relationship with a 20-year-old volunteer.
Pastor Ted Haggard recognized on CNN's Larry King Live that he had a second relationship with a man.
The incident occurred when the two men were in bed together, Grant Haas said in a videotaped interview with CNN's Larry King Live.
He asked me if it was okay if he masturbated in front of me or masturbated in bed next to me, Haas said. I said no, it would make me very uncomfortable. But he took a bottle of lotion and started masturbating.
Haas added, ""LRB-Haggard-RRB- used to tell me, ""You know what, Grant, you can become a man of God, and you can have some fun next door.""
Haggard, 52, said the incident was an indicator of the compulsive behavior that ruled him at the time. However, he said that he has been in treatment for the two years since then and that he has solved it. Look at Haggard accuser speak
The controversy involving Haggard erupted for the first time in November 2006, when a former prostitute, Mike Jones, said the pastor had paid him for having sex for three years and had used methamphetamine in his presence.
Haggard initially admitted in interviews that he received a massage from Jones but refused to have sex with him. He also said he bought meth, but he threw it away instead of using it.
The allegations received extensive news coverage and led to accusations of hypocrisy, particularly because Haggard had condemned homosexual sex. See Haggard address the allegations about Oprah
Haggard is the former president of the National Evangelical Association, which claims to represent millions of people in 45,000 congregations across the country. He was also the chief pastor of the Church of New Life.
In an agreement with New Life, the church and Haggard agreed that they would keep their six-figure salary for a year, leave the Colorado Springs area, receive advice and not speak publicly about what had happened for a year, according to a church staff member with knowledge of the agreement but who was not allowed to speak on the record.
In CNN's interview, Haggard attributed to Jones that he had helped him reveal that information.
I think he rescued me. “I am very grateful to you,” Haggard said. He said he would have lost the support of his 30-year-old wife, Gail, and his five children and was a drug addict had he not been caught.
I paid a very high price. He said he was stupid.
Haggard compared his struggles with his desires to the struggles faced by dietists who say, ""I won't eat today and then eat.""
Many of the charges against me are exaggerated, but it doesn't matter, Haggard told Larry King. I'm pretty guilty of so many things.
He acknowledged that his actions were hypocritical, but said he could not control his impulses.
I felt that God's plan was for sexuality to be in a monogamous, heterosexual marriage, he said. I wanted that. But at the same time, I had these other things going on.
Haggard said he had thought that focusing on his spiritual life would help, but found that he did not. It actually made me worse, he said.
Haggard said that, for a while, he lost his ability to read the Scriptures and became suicidal. I think it was divine intervention that stopped me, he said.
Asked if he has engaged in inappropriate conduct with any other man, Haggard did not give a direct answer, saying only, I have discussed in depth my entire sexual history with my wife and my therapist and, to some extent, the family, and we believe it is an appropriate limit to that.
When asked if he considers himself bisexual or gay, Haggard said that different therapists have described him in different ways. The first said, ""You're a heterosexual with homosexual attachments.I wasn't sure what that meant.
His current therapist, he said, described him as a heterosexual with complications.
Haggard said he had at least another year of therapy ahead of him.
I think I'm still deeply hurt and marked and somewhat confused, he said. About other men, he added, I have thoughts from time to time, but not convincing thoughts.
However, he said: Today I am 100% satisfied with my relationship with my wife, and I have no convincing things in my life for others.
He said he initially urged his wife to leave him, but she refused.
I really love this man, she told CNN when she was asked why he didn't leave. But it was also her faith that led her to continue the marriage, she said. Jesus ’ teaching is that we forgive and love.
He said they both had a great sexual relationship in our marriage... throughout the marriage.
Although the news of his infidelity came as a shock, it was not entirely out of nowhere, he said. I knew Ted had some struggles in this area, particularly in his thoughts. I never knew he acted with them.
Marcus Haggard, the couple's 25-year-old son, said that he, too, was surprised by the revelations, but was more concerned about knowing that his father had lied. However, he said the news brought the family closer.
He had lived so long on a pedestal, Marcus Haggard said about his famous father. It seemed practically perfect. There was a sense of relief in the fact that we could connect with our father.
When asked if he wanted to go back to the pulpit, Haggard said, I think Gail and I want to tell our story to the extent that it is useful for other people. I don't know if that would mean a pulpit, but I'd certainly be interested in speaking in public.
His appearance on Thursday coincided with the debut of an HBO documentary called The Trial of Ted Haggard.

"-LRB-CNN -RRB- Craigslist reports about 80 million ads on their site every month, so even if you haven't met a stranger to buy or sell something online, you're likely to meet someone who did.
The vast majority of transactions go smoothly, but the site has a history of being co-opted by criminals sometimes.
A couple from Georgia were traveling to a Craigslist transaction last month when they left their suburban home in Atlanta hoping to buy a 1966 Ford Mustang. They did everything right... they went together, and they told their family they were going to the transaction.
However, the bodies of Elrey Bud Runion and his wife, June, were found on January 26, according to the police. A man from South Georgia has been charged with murder in their deaths.
In a separate incident on Friday, two men in Georgia met with a salesman to buy a dog. The seller pointed a gun at them in an attempted robbery, but one of the buyers carried a gun and shot him fatally, the police said. The investigation is ongoing.
Recent incidents should remind those involved in this type of online trade that it is desirable to be vigilant. So what can you do to make sure you don't fall prey to ne'er-do-wells next time you respond to an online ad?
Philip Holloway is a law adviser and defense attorney with some tips on things to remember when buying and selling goods online:
10. Do not disclose personal information
Remember that this is a business transaction, so never disclose Social Security numbers, home or business addresses, or bank information.
9. Keep your cell phone close
Have a cell phone in your hand throughout the transaction and be ready to call 911 at the first sign of trouble.
8. Don't use your personal email
Use an anonymous email address to communicate with the buyer or seller.
7. Disable caller identifier
Disable the caller ID when calling the buyer or seller on the phone. Most cell phone and landline companies offer this by dialing *67 before making the outgoing call.
6. Do not pay cash
Do not accept cash and do not offer to pay cash. Use a cash check instead and make it a non-negotiable transaction term.
5. If it's a high-priced transaction, do it in a bank.
The higher the price of the item in question, the greater the risk of the transaction. Carry out these transactions in a banking service so that a banking professional can confirm that the funds have been successfully delivered.
4. Meet always during the day
Never make your transactions at night.
3. We never see each other at home.
Find a neutral place to meet... never in your home or someone else's.
2. Tell someone.
Tell a trusted friend or family member what you are doing and have another trusted friend or family member accompany you to the transaction.
1. Meet always in a public place
Most police departments will be happy to accommodate you, and are open 24 hours a day.

"President Obama will impose tariffs on imports of some Chinese tyres for three years in an effort to curb an increase in exports that has shaken the U.S. tire industry.
The White House announced plans to impose tariffs on some tyres entering the United States from China.
The new rates will be in the passenger car and light truck tyres, the White House said in a statement Friday night.
The president decided to remedy the clear disruption to the U.S. tire industry based on the facts and the law in this case, the statement said.
Rates will start at 35 percent in the first year, then fall to 30 percent in the second year and 25 percent in the third year.
In the past, Chinese leaders have expressed displeasure at a possible tyre rate.
We hope that the U.S. government will refrain from taking action, for the long-term healthy and stable development of U.S.-China relations, Fu Ziying, China's deputy trade minister, told local media in August.
The case is not supported by facts and has no valid legal basis, he added.

"There are many law enforcement agencies in the United States, and especially in California. Some of the largest agencies in Southern California are the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Both police forces are some of the largest in the country. They handle a full range of police tasks ranging from traffic appointments to murder, rape, and robbery cases. There are also a number of smaller law enforcement agencies operating side by side with Los Angeles police and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Cities, such as Monterey Park, have their own police force, while smaller cities rely on the Sheriff's Department for their law enforcement needs. Due to the unique nature of the state, California created the California Highway Patrol.

The CHP, as it is often called, is a police agency that is responsible for patrolling the large number of highway miles that exist in California. The state was built during a time of great mobility after the arrival of the personal vehicle. Because of this, the state has more highway miles than any other state in the United States with the exception of Texas. However, California has the most authorized drivers, and by far, the most registered vehicles. This made it necessary to create a police force dedicated to its roads.
Officers of the Commission for the Protection of Human Rights have the same powers as other police officers. However, they do not have a crime investigation team for any crimes other than those related to trafficking. Each time the CHP responds for the first time to a non-traffic offence, its officers perform the same functions as a regular officer. Then hand over the investigations to L.A.P.D., or the sheriff's office depending on the location of the crime. CHP has a long history. Many young Californians, both men and women, are attracted to the CHP, and enroll in its academy in Sacramento, the state capital.",B2
"-LRB-CNN-RRB- A Minneapolis police officer was shot on Saturday morning, and Police Chief Janee Harteau said there is no doubt that an officer was the intended target.
The injured officer was one of the two who had just responded to a reported robbery when he was shot just before 5 a.m. - LRB- at 6 a.m. ET-RRB-, Minneapolis police said in a statement. His partner quickly took him to the North Memorial Medical Center.
Deputy Chief of Police Matt Clark told reporters on Saturday afternoon that the officer, who was standing outside his car, was fine and in good condition.
A man was arrested in connection with the robbery and an alleged domestic assault, Clark said. Police arrested Andrew Neal, 43, suspected of violating his parole.
Detectives are investigating whether there is a link between the domestic violence report, the robbery and the shooting, the deputy chief said.
A woman who reported the alleged assault was cooperating with the authorities. He gave us a lot of information - LRB- about the incident and the robbery -RRB-, he said.
The police believe the injured officer was not the personal target, but he was shot simply because he is a police officer, police spokesman Scott Seroka added.
According to Harteau, it was he who was there.
This is a reminder to everyone that each of our officers faces such danger simply because they choose to wear a uniform, Harteau said. They deserve our support and gratitude.
The officer they shot is well respected by his co-workers and does an excellent job, Clark said.

"There comes a time in the lives of some men when the days seem darker, the mortality safer, and the only sensible answer is to blow up life savings in a sports car.
Radical and often inadvisable lifestyle changes have become the cards of the mid-life crisis, but, if it is more than a myth, then humans may not be the only animals to experience it.
Now an international team of scientists claims to have found evidence of a decline in well-being between chimpanzees and middle-aged orangutans. Calm in happiness in the middle years, they say, is the mono equivalent of the mid-life crisis.
The study, which was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, has raised eyebrows among some scientists but, according to the authors, the findings suggest that the mid-life crisis may have its roots in biology that humans share with our closest evolutionary cousins.
“There is a common understanding that there is a decline in well-being in the Middle Ages,” said Alex Weiss, a psychologist at the University of Edinburgh, to The Guardian.
“We take a step back and ask if it is possible that, instead of the mid-life crisis being human-specific and driven solely by social factors, it reflects an evolved trend for middle-aged individuals to have a lower well-being,” he said.
The U.S., Japan, Germany, and UK team asked zookeepers, caregivers, and others who worked with male and female apes of various ages to complete animal questionnaires.
The forms included questions about the mood of each ape, the enjoyment they obtained from socialization, and their success in achieving certain goals. The last question asked how caregivers would feel about being the monkey for a week. They scored their answers from one to seven.
The study included more than 500 apes in three different groups. The first two groups were chimpanzees, with the third consisting of orangutans from Sumatra or Borneo. The animals came from zoos, sanctuaries, and research centers in the United States, Australia, Japan, Canada, and Singapore.
When the researchers analyzed the questionnaires, they found that the welfare in the apes fell into middle age and rose again as the animals approached old age. In captivity, great apes often live up to 50 or more. Nadir in animal welfare occurred, on average, at 28.3 and 27.2 years for chimpanzees, and 35.4 years for orangutans.
“In all three groups we find evidence that well-being is lower in chimpanzees and orangutans at an age that corresponds approximately to middle age in humans,” Weiss said. “On average, welfare scores are lower when animals are about 30 years old.”
The team explains that the temporary fall in the welfare of apes may result from seeing depressed apes dying younger, or through age-related changes in the brain that are reflected in humans. Weiss admitted that, unlike men, apes are not known for pursuing radical and often disastrous lifestyle changes in middle age.
Robin Dunbar, professor of Evolutionary Psychology at Oxford University, was doubtful about the findings. “What can produce a sense of well-being or contentment that varies throughout life like this? It's hard to see anything in the life of an ape that has that kind of pattern, that they'd think of. They are not particularly good at seeing the future; that is one of the great differences between them and us.” Alexandra Freund, professor of psychology at the University of Zurich, was also skeptical. He said that the concept of a mid-life crisis was unstable even in humans. “In my reading of literature, there is no evidence for the mid-life crisis. If there is any indication of deterioration in emotional or subjective well-being it is very small and, in many studies, it is not at all there.”
But Weiss believes that the findings could point to a deeper understanding of the emotional crisis that some men may experience. “If we want to find the answer as to what is happening with the mid-life crisis, we must look at what is similar in middle-aged humans, chimpanzees and orangutans,” he said.

"It's very common to see homeless people on the streets of Los Angeles. This is a problem that has persisted in the city since the beginning of the 20th century. At that time, California was known for offering many job opportunities in agriculture, and many young people were jumping on trains across the country to get to Los Angeles. Unfortunately, many of those men often ended up without a job, a place to stay, or even food to eat. To help these people, many churches began to establish shelters in the Los Angeles area that would eventually become the center of the city. Although the agricultural landscape changed to a large city environment, these shelters remained a refuge for many homeless people

Today, the homeless population of Los Angeles is made up of much more than just young job seekers. Many economic and social changes have led to men and women of all ages going to the streets of Los Angeles. Some of them are there as a result of substance abuse that has left them out of money and out of work. Others are veterans of various wars who cannot find the resources to return to their normal lives. In addition, many of these people suffer from mental disabilities that prevent them from finding a job or being accepted into the rest of society.
Since there are many different causes leading to homelessness, it is easy to see why finding solutions to help all homeless people is so difficult. While there are many programmes that focus on the daily provision of food to the homeless, it is much more difficult to find programmes that seek to help the homeless find work and stable housing. In order to finally find a solution that effectively helps to reduce the number of homeless people in the city, much more individualized care must be given to people according to their physical and mental health, and their circumstances.",B2
"Sir Alex Ferguson will retire as manager of Manchester United at the end of the season in the year 27 of a term that has made him the most successful manager in British football. While he will become director and ambassador of United, the club will have to find someone to replace a man who has won 13 English Premier League titles, two Champions Leagues, the Cup Winners Cup, five FA Cups and four League Cups.
Regarding his decision, Ferguson said: “The decision to retire is a decision that I have thought a lot and that I have not taken lightly. It's the right time. It was important for me to leave an organization as firmly as possible and I think I have. The quality of this league winning squad, and the age balance within it, augur for continued success at the highest level, while the structure of the youth organization will ensure that the club's long-term future remains bright.
“Our training facilities are among the best in the world’s sport and our home, Old Trafford, is rightly regarded as one of the leading places in the world. Looking to the future, I am delighted to assume the role of club director and ambassador. With these activities, along with my many other interests, I am looking forward to the future. I must pay tribute to my family; their love and support have been essential. My wife, Cathy, has been the key figure throughout my career, providing a basis for stability and encouragement. Words are not enough to express what this has meant to me.
“As for my players and staff, past and present, I would like to thank you all for an amazing level of professional conduct and dedication that has helped deliver so many memorable triumphs. Without your contribution, the history of this great club would not be so rich. In my early years, the board's backing, and Sir Bobby Charlton in particular, gave me the confidence and time to build a football club, instead of just a football team.
“Over the last decade, the Glazer family has provided me with the platform to manage Manchester United the best of my ability and
I've been extremely fortunate to have worked with an executive with talent and confidence in David Gill. I am truly grateful to all of them. Fans, thank you. The support they have provided over the years has been truly humiliating. It has been an honor and an enormous privilege to have had the opportunity to lead your club and I have treasured my time as manager of Manchester United.”
The sudden nature of Ferguson's game is in line with how the Scotsman declared he would leave the post after mentioning a first retreat during the 2001/2 season before making a U-turn. It is understood that he gathered the players in the costumes of the first team shortly after they arrived to train on Wednesday morning. In an emotional speech, he announced that he would resign. He then took his staff from the back room to the side before finally addressing the rest of the staff in the canteen.
Joel Glazer, co-owner of Manchester United, said: “Alex has shown again and again how fantastic the manager is, but he is also a wonderful person. His determination to succeed and dedication to the club has been truly remarkable. I will always appreciate the wonderful memories he has given us, like that magical night in Moscow.”
Avie Glazer, his brother, said: “I am delighted to announce that Alex has agreed to stay with the club as a director. His contributions to Manchester United over the past 27 years have been extraordinary and, like all United fans, I want him to be part of his future.”
David Gill, the outgoing executive director, said: “I have had the tremendous pleasure of working closely with Alex for 16 unforgettable years – through the triple, double, countless trophies won and numerous signatures. We knew that your retirement would come one day and we have both been planning for it by ensuring the quality of the staff and the club structures are in first class condition. Alex's vision, energy and skill have built teams – both inside and outside the field – with which his successor can count as one of the best and most loyal in the world's sport.
“The way you care about this club, its staff and the football family in general is something I admire. It's one side of it that's often hidden from the public's eyes, but it's something I've had the privilege of witnessing over the past 16 years.
What you have done for this club and for the game in general will never be forgotten. It has been the greatest experience of my working life to be with Alex and a great honor to be able to call him a friend.”
First team coach René Meulensteen revealed how Ferguson gave the news to his back room staff on Wednesday morning. “I found out this morning when I came to the club,” he said. “He called us in his office and told us what decision he had made. He's always been on cards – there's speculation every season. I think the manager kept his cards close to his chest. I think he felt the moment was right now and made a decision.
“Obviously he is a man who thinks very, very hard, so I’m sure he has thought a lot about making this decision. I wish you all the best. It has been fantastic for this club and I hope that all fans will give the same support they receive.”",B2
"One of the most significant dates in the history of the United States is November 22, 1963. That's the day President John Fitzgerald Kennedy was murdered in Dallas, Texas while traveling in an outdoor car. The president was visiting Texas for the first time since its inauguration in January 1961. Kennedy was one of the most popular presidents in the history of the United States, and he remains so today. His death shocked the nation for several reasons, but above all because it was televised on a live broadcast. Kennedy was the first president to appear on television at a time when most Americans owned a television. He was not the first president to be televised, but previous presidents who appeared on television did not reach the general public because before 1960, not many Americans possessed a set.

Kennedy was warned not to ride in an outdoor car that day by his bodyguards, but he wanted the public to see him live. I didn't want to be hiding behind an armored car. According to the government's official commission, Kennedy was the victim of a single killer, Lee Harvey Oswald, but many Americans dispute that conclusion to this date. Police say Oswald shot the president from a building while Kennedy was riding in his car with his wife. The mood was festive at the time the city of Dallas welcomed the president to Texas. Kennedy was a handsome young president who was the youngest man in the presidency.
Oswald later killed a Dallas police officer during his escape from the crime scene, but was soon found hiding in a movie theater. He required police protection from an outraged public, and was kept in protective custody. Oswald, who was a former U.S. military officer, was unhappy with the president for his policies, but never admitted to being the killer. There have also been conspiracy theories involving rival political parties, the Cuban government and organized crime as to who killed Kennedy.",B2
"Many of us know that we are deprived of sleep, but imagine if we could fix it with a fairly simple solution: get up later. In a speech at the British Science Festival, Dr. Paul Kelley, a clinical research partner at the Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute at Oxford University, asked schools to scale their start times to work with the natural biological rhythms of their students. It would improve cognitive performance, test results, and student health (sleep deprivation has been associated with diabetes, depression, obesity, and an impaired immune system).
It follows an article, published in 2014, in which he pointed out that, when children are about ten years old, their biological awakening time is around 6.30am; at 16, this rises to 8am; and at 18, someone who can think like a lazy teenager actually has a natural waking hour at 9am. The start time of the conventional school works for children aged 10, but not for children aged 16 to 18. For older teens, it might be wiser to start school day at 11 a.m. or even later. “A 7am alarm call for older teens,” Kelley and her colleagues in the newspaper said, “is the equivalent of a start at 4.30am for a 50-year-old teacher.”
He says it's not as simple as persuading teenagers to sleep first. “The natural rhythm of the body is controlled by a particular type of light,” Kelley says. “The eye not only contains rods and cones; it contains cells that then report to the suprachiasmatic nuclei in the hypothalamus.” This part of the brain controls our circadian rhythms over a 24-hour cycle. “It is light that controls it. It's like saying, 'Why can't you control your heartbeat? '""
But it is not only students who would benefit from a later start. Kelley says the working day should be more indulgent with our natural rhythms. Describing the average sleep loss per night for different age groups, he says: “Between 14 and 24, it is more than two hours. For people between the ages of 24 and 30 or 35, it is about an hour and a half. That can go on until you're about 55 when you're in balance again. The 10-and-55-year-old wakes up and sleeps naturally at the same time.”
That is why, he adds, the traditional nine to five are so entrenched; it is maintained by the bosses, many of them in the mid-50s and upwards because “it is the best for them.” So should workplaces have staggered start times as well? Should 50-year-olds or older arrive at 8 a.m., while 30-year-olds begin at 10 a.m. and the inmate or apprentice is encouraged to show up at 11 a.m.? Kelley says synchronized hours could have “many positive consequences. The positive side of this is people's performance, mood and health will improve. It is very upbuilding in a way because it is a solution that will make people less sick, happier and better at what they do.”
There would probably be fewer accidents as drivers would be more alert, he says. I could spell the end of the rush hour as people stagger their working and school time. A later start of the day for many, Kelley says, “is something that would benefit everyone, particularly families. Parents go and try to wake up teenagers who are waking up three hours earlier. It creates tensions for everyone.”
So what time does Kelley start working? “I’m 67 years old, so that means I’m ten years old again and I get up right after six. And, yes, he says he finds the start of his working day much easier now than when he was younger.

"During the first part of the twentieth century, poliomyelitis was considered one of the greatest health threats in the United States of America. Polio was a vicious disease that claimed the life of the victim, or left her with severe disabilities. In 1952, the United States suffered one of its hardest polio epidemics in its history. More than 58,000 polio cases were reported that year and 3,145 people lost their lives. In addition, more than 21,000 people suffered some form of paralysis ranging from mild paralysis to extreme cases in which people became disabled. Dr. Jonas Salk is responsible for ending that plague.

Born in New York on October 28, 1914, Jonas Salk grew up in a modest environment. His parents were not rich, but they could put food on the table, and keep a roof over the head of their children. Salk demonstrated great academic success since childhood. At the age of 13, he was enrolled in a school for gifted children. He was considered a perfectionist by his colleagues, and was successful academically in a very competitive environment. In college, Salk chose to go to medical school even though his mother wanted him to become a lawyer. After graduating from medical school, Salk began his research on poliomyelitis, which was considered a scourge of Western society.
Polio had bewildered medical science since its discovery in the mid-19th century. When Salk turned his attention to the disease, there was little hope that someone could find a proper cure. Salk developed his vaccine in the early 1950s, and in April 1955, his achievement was announced in newspapers across the country. Salk became a national hero. His vaccine effectively ended the polio epidemic in the United States and in many countries around the world.",B2
"Christmas, which is celebrated on December 25, is a Christian feast celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ. Christians of different denominations go to church at Christmas. Many Catholics go to midnight mass. In the United States, however, the party has a much more secular tone, and is celebrated throughout the country. Many people, regardless of their religion, put up and decorate a Christmas tree. The tree can be a real evergreen or it can be an artificial tree. Lights, ropes, chisel and even popcorn can be used to decorate a Christmas tree. At the top of the tree is a star or an angel. The decorations are usually red and green.

The purpose of a Christmas tree is to have a central location to make gifts. According to legend, a cheerful, fat man with a beard, named Santa Claus, leaves gifts under the tree. Children in the U.S. They often write lists of things they want Santa to bring them. Many parents take their children to malls across the country to tell a man dressed as Santa what they want. These children are also often photographed with the Santa shopping center as a souvenir. On Christmas Eve many children leave milk and cookies for Santa Claus. Of course, it is parents who buy presents from wish lists, and even eat cookies and drink milk. On Christmas Day children usually get up early and run to the tree so they can see what Santa brought them. Adults can also exchange gifts at this time.
People don't just decorate a tree at Christmas. Many also elaborately decorate their homes with lights. Some of the screens even sync with Christmas songs called carols. Originally these songs were religious, but now it's about the spirit of the season.",B2

"A judge in New Haven sentenced a 31-year-old man to death on Friday for his role in a deadly invasion that killed a woman and her two daughters in 2007.
Juries convicted Joshua Komisarjevsky in October on six counts of capital crime. The 12-member jury had recommended death by lethal injection on each of the charges.
The task of sentencing another human being to death is the most sober and gloomy experience a judge can have, Superior Court Judge Jon Blue said.
Komisarjevsky responded on Friday, saying he entered this angry and defiant trial.
It is a surrealistic experience to be condemned to die, he said. Our apathetic pursuits trampled on the innocent.
He said I didn't rape. I didn't pour that gas or light that fire.
“I will never find peace again and my soul is torn apart,” Komisarjevsky added.
The family of his victims left the room before Komisarjevsky spoke.
Richard Hawke, in a victim's statement before the sentence, said that the murders of his daughter and granddaughters had left him half dead.
They offered to give you everything you asked, you didn't have to take their lives, he told Komisarjevsky. From now on you will be known as a prison number in the book of death. You're in God's hands now.
The man convicted of being an accomplice to Komisarjevsky, Steven Hayes, was sentenced to death in 2010. The jurors convicted the couple on charges that beat and tied up Dr. William Petit Jr., raped and strangled his wife, abused one of his daughters and set fire to the house before trying to flee.
Petit is the only survivor of the attack that killed his wife and two daughters.
“I lost my family and my home,” Petit said. My wife, my friend, my partner. I miss our evening talks and our partnership to raise girls.
Before attacking and killing Jennifer Hawke-Petit, Hayes forced her to go to a bank and withdraw $15,000 from an account after finding evidence that the account had between $20,000 and $30,000, authorities said.
The two daughters, both tied to their beds, died from smoke inhalation, while William Petit managed to escape from the basement, where he had been held.
Hayes had been charged with third-degree robbery in 2003 and sentenced to five years ' imprisonment. He was released three years later to a halfway house, where he met Komisarjevsky.
Komisarjevsky's lawyers had asked for clemency, arguing that he had no history of violence, was abused as a child and was placed in a mental hospital due to depression.

"There was a time on this earth when the United States of America did not exist. Before the 1770s, the region was largely an Indian country with the exception of 13 British colonies in the northeastern part of the country. These colonies were known as the American Colonies, and were under British rule. The 13 colonies were a group of freely connected individual states that were governed by the Continental Congress. The Congress had been at odds with the British for several years, mainly because of taxes being collected by their Parliament.

In 1775, after a year of war between the American colonies and England, the colonists decided it was time to become independent. The English Parliament had issued two unpopular taxes, which were imposed to help support the British after the end of the Seven Years' War. The settlers asked Thomas Jefferson to write the Declaration of Independence arguing that since the colonies had no say in the affairs of Parliament, they should not be taxed.
The statement was drafted by Jefferson on July 2, 1776, and was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4. Today, 4 July is celebrated in the United States as the day of independence of British rule. The statement presents what has been called the most famous phrase in the English language. It says: ""We consider these truths to be evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among them are Life, Freedom and the pursuit of Happiness."" These words were written to represent the moral and ethical standards that the new country should follow. It's a very well written document, and it represents everything this country is trying to be.",B2
"Some of the world's largest and most expensive transportation projects have involved building bridges. Bridges are crucial links that transport cars, trucks, and trains through bodies of water, mountain gorges, or other roads. As a result, they are one of the most important aspects of civil engineering and are subject to intense scrutiny, especially when they collapse.
The collapses of the bridge can be tragic events, leading to loss of life and serious material damage. That is why engineers, designers and bridge builders must always take their jobs very seriously. The best way to prevent these accidents is to understand why bridges collapse in the first place. Understanding the collapses of bridges can lead to significant changes in the design, construction and safety of future construction projects. The following are the main reasons why bridges fall.
Fire
Historically, more bridges were made of wood and were much more susceptible to fire. This was particularly true of old-fashioned train bridges, where the spark created by steel wheels and steel tracks could sometimes cause a bridge to burn and burn on the ground.
During construction
A large number of bridge accidents occur during the construction of the bridge itself. These accidents are often due to an error made by engineers, such as a miscalculation. The bridge collapses under its own weight, and this can be deadly to the workers at that time.
Earthquakes
Earthquakes damage all structures, including bridges. Fortunately, this type of collapse is relatively rare, especially with modern bridges. Engineers have learned to design bridges in seismic areas in areas that are much more resistant to movement.
Default
Some bridge collapses are mysteries, and engineers only realize why after conducting a full investigation. In some cases, this could happen because inferior quality material was used in the construction, or because of a defect in a key piece of the bridge. In other cases, the bridge was designed only to withstand a certain amount of weight and no more.
Boat or train crash
Both types of accidents are extremely rare, but ships and trains can cause a bridge to collapse for different reasons. With trains, it's impact speed that can bring down a bridge. With ships, it is the very large mass they have that can cause collapse, even if they are moving very slowly when it happens.
The best way to avoid bridge flaws is to plan for them. Modern technologies that can detect structural weaknesses, safer working environments, and better designs can help reduce these terrible accidents.",B2
"July 4th is the celebration by the United States of its independence from England. It is the day the Declaration of Independence was adopted by the ancestors of the new country, and it is a national holiday. It is celebrated every year since 1776. Americans celebrate this day as one of the most revered festivals in the country.

Independence Day celebrations include fireworks that are organized by various organizations across the country. The shows are held in stadiums, recreational parks and private houses. In addition, many companies have special gifts and discounts for all residents on this day. Fireworks shows are the best in stadiums, where they attract a large number of people. This is a recent change in the way Americans celebrate the day. In the past, most people bought their own fireworks from vendors who sell their products in supermarket parking lots.
The reason why many cities no longer allow the sale, or the use of fireworks, is due to the fire risks they pose. That is why large stadiums and professional celebrations parks have become popular in recent years. Of course, many people still celebrate at home. There are some cities where the sale and use of fireworks are still legal, and many Americans take full advantage of this.
Another tradition of July 4th is the backyard barbecue. Holidays take place in the middle of the summer, and Americans love to roast outdoors to avoid heat inside the house. Burgers and hot dogs are the food of choice, but steaks are also often prepared. There's nothing better than a great American meal and a cold drink celebrating July 4th. It's a popular party, and it's one that has great significance for most Americans.",B2
"Social media, magazines and shop windows bombard people daily with things to buy, and British consumers are buying more clothes and shoes than ever before. Online shopping means it's easy for customers to buy without thinking, while big brands offer clothes so cheap that they can be treated as disposable items – used two or three times and then thrown away.
In Britain, the average person spends more than £1,000 a year on new clothing, which accounts for about 4% of his income. That may not sound much, but that figure conceals two far more worrying trends for society and the environment. First, much of that consumer spending is through credit cards. Currently, the British owe approximately £670 per adult to credit card companies. That's 66% of the average closet budget. Besides, people don't just spend money they don't have, they're using it to buy things they don't need. Britain throws 300,000 tons of clothes a year, most of which go to landfills.
People may not realize that they are part of the disposable clothing problem because they donate their unwanted clothing to charities. But charity stores can't sell all those unwanted clothes. ""Fast fashion"" goes out of fashion as quickly as it comes in and is often of very poor quality for recycling; people don't want to buy it second hand. Large amounts end up being discarded, and a lot of clothes that charities cannot sell are shipped abroad, causing even more economic and environmental problems.
However, a different trend is emerging in opposition to consumerism – the tendency to ""buy nothing."" The idea originated in Canada in the early 1990s and then moved to the United States, where it became a rejection of the excessive spending and consumption of Black Friday and Cyber Monday during the Thanksgiving weekend. On the day of buying nothing people organize various kinds of protests and cut their credit cards. Throughout the year, the Buy Nothing groups organize the exchange and repair of items they already own.
The trend has now reached social media influencers who usually share clothing and makeup posts that they recommend for people to buy. Some YouTube stars now encourage their viewers not to buy anything at all for periods like a year. Two friends in Canada spent a year working to buy only food. During the first three months they learned to live without buying electrical items, clothing, or things for the house. For the next stage, they abandoned services, such as haircuts, eating in restaurants or buying gasoline for their cars. In a year, they had saved $55,000.
The changes they made meant two fewer cars on the roads, a reduction in plastic and paper containers and a positive impact on the environment of all the energy saved. If everyone followed a similar plan, the results would be impressive. But even if you can't handle a full year without shopping, you can participate in the anti-consumer movement by refusing to buy things you don't need. The Buy Nothing groups send a clear message to companies that people are no longer willing to accept the environmental and human costs of excessive consumption.",B2
"A wave of small earthquakes rumbling near Mammoth Mountain volcano have been categorized as volcanic disturbances by the United States Geological Survey.
Nearly three dozen earthquakes ranging from magnitude 2.6 to 3.8 have swarmed the area, northeast of Fresno, California, in the last two days.
Earthquake swarms in this region are not uncommon. David Shelly, a seismologist at the California Volcano Observatory, said this swarm is larger than we've seen recently, but normal in the area. He adds that they are closely watching the movement, but in the broader scheme of things, it is within the range of activity over the last decades.
Mammoth Mountain is located in an area called Long Valley Caldera. The center of the boiler has been rising slowly over the last few decades and seismologists continuously monitor it. We believe there is fluid coming from the crust that triggers the earthquakes, Shelly said.
The last swarm of earthquakes from 1997 to 1998 produced more than 2,500 earthquakes a week at its peak, according to the USGS. Since then, the region has been relatively quiet.
In July, USGS scientists installed a volcanic gas monitoring station on the mountain. It tracks gases that fluctuate with seismic activity to better track changes in real time.
The level of awareness on the United States General Service website remains ecological/normal. Mammoth Mountain, standing at 11,053 feet, last exploded about 57,000 years ago, according to the USGS.

"On December 7, 1941, the United States of America was attacked by the Imperial Japanese Navy in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The surprise attack was intended to destroy the American Pacific Fleet that stood in the way of Japan's complete domination of the Pacific Ocean during the 1940s. The attack was coordinated with attacks in the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong. Pearl Harbor was attacked by more than 350 Japanese fighter planes, bombers and torpedo planes that were launched from six aircraft carriers.

The attack of the early morning sank four U.S. battleships, and four others were seriously damaged. Six of the eight battleships were restored, and returned to service, but the Japanese also destroyed, or damaged, three cruisers, three destroyers, a mine hunter and an anti-aircraft training ship. In addition, 188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed, many of them on land. The attack was devastating. It took the United States years to recover from all the damage caused in that fateful morning. However, the Japanese were unable to destroy their main targets, the Navy carriers. So some call a stroke of luck, the U.S. fleet of aircraft carriers. I was at sea at the time of the attack.
The country was shocked by the news of the disaster. U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt described the attack as cowardly, and declared December 7 as ""a day that will live in infamy."" On December 8, the United States formally declared war on Japan. This plummeted the country in World War II, which Roosevelt had long hoped to avoid. Shortly after the U.S. declaration of war against Japan, Germany, which was a Japanese ally, declared war on the U.S. and the country was now fully involved in the largest war in world history.",B2
"Today all the information we might need is available online and some people say it means the purpose of having to learn anything.
It is true that these days everything you want to know is just a few clicks away, as long as you have access to the Internet. However, not everyone has the Internet working all the time, for example in certain buildings or remote places, so we need to be able to remember the information. Also, it takes time to search for everything you need to know online, while remembering something is immediate. Human memory is a much more efficient system.
Another problem is the quality of online information. How do we know if it's accurate or reliable? We need to think about other facts we know and remember how to compare information from different websites. Knowing (and remembering) how to find certain information will be more important than knowing the information itself.
Finally, the Internet is a good tool, but it is not a useful replacement for our brains. If we didn't remember anything, we would all spend even more time on our phones and computers than we already do, which is not good for society.
In conclusion, the Internet offers us many things, but it is still important to use our knowledge and memories. We need our memories to run without the internet and we also need to know how to use the Internet properly.",B2
"The airline operating an Airbus A310-300 aircraft that crashed into the Indian Ocean on Tuesday with 153 people on board was being monitored by EU authorities, according to France's transport minister.
An Airbus 310 like the one photographed crashed as it headed for the capital of the Comoros.
Dominique Bussereau told French television that her country's inspectors had also observed several flaws in the doomed Yemenia Airways aircraft, Agence France-Presse reported.
The company was not on the blacklist - LRB- of airlines banned in European airspace -RRB-, but was being subjected to a closer inspection by us and was soon to be heard by the European Union security committee, Bussereau said.
The Airbus A310 was inspected in France in 2007 by the French Civil Aviation Authority and several failures were noted.
The plane had not reappeared in our country since then, he added.
However, Chris Yates, an aviation analyst at Jane's Information Group, said he suspected weather and/or airport failures were a greater factor in the accident than a technical failure. Last falls of aircraft
It's more than likely to be a climate-related incident. That said, a maintenance problem cannot be ruled out, Yates told CNN.
Yemenita Air had used the aircraft since 1999, on some 17,300 flights, Airbus officials said. The company said it would help investigate the accident.
We are extremely sad and our thoughts are with families, friends and loved ones affected by this accident, Airbus spokesman Maggie Bergsma told CNN.
We are giving our utmost support and assistance to the authorities and the airline.
This includes a team of Airbus experts who will be on site and our crisis center has been open since early this morning, where our specialists work in direct contact with the airline and authorities, Bergsma added.
The task now is to gather as much information as possible, including the recovery of black boxes, to help us understand what happened. This will require time and patience.
It's the second accident involving an Airbus plane in a month. On June 1, an Air France Airbus A330 crashed in front of Brazil while traveling from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, France. The 228 on board are presumed dead. The case is still under investigation.
Following the Air France accident on 1 June, US investigators have been investigating two recent failures of the speed and altitude indications on board the Airbus A330.
One flight was between the United States and Brazil in May and the other between Hong Kong and Japan in June. The aircraft landed safely and there were no injuries or damage, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.

"The besieged Syrian government will receive at least 10 combat aircraft from Russia -- and they want more, reports from Russian state media -- movements that come in the midst of rocky diplomatic efforts to peacefully end the bloody civil war of the Middle East nation.
A source involved in Russia's defense complex said Friday to the official Itar-Tass news agency that Russia will sell MiG-29 fighter planes from Bashar al-Assad's government to fulfill a contract... which was concluded a long time ago.
A Syrian delegation in Moscow is pushing for more planes, with MiG executive Sergei Korotkov, telling the news of RIA Novosti, led by the Russian state, that his company and these Syrian authorities are talking about the details and time frame of a possible contact.
Such discussions take place immediately after the European Union's decision to end its Syrian arms embargo. That measure was seen as opening the door to European nations to help the rebel fighters militarily, although it could give Russia more space to support its former ally, Assad.
It is not clear how the weapons, fighter planes and ammunition flowing into Syria will affect the fighting there, let alone the unsuccessful attempts so far to forge a negotiated agreement.
Some 80,000 people have died since the beginning of hostilities more than two years ago, said the President of the United Nations General Assembly, Vuk Jeremic, earlier this month. Another 1.5 million or more people have fled the country.
In addition to combat aircraft, Russia would have sold six S-300 air defence systems to Syria under a 2010 contract.
Asked on Thursday about these and other arms sales, al-Assad said it is not our policy to speak publicly about military issues in terms of what we own or receive.
Explosion in Damascus district kills 8
As for Russia, the contracts had nothing to do with the crisis, Al-Manar of Hezbollah told television, according to a transcript from the official Syrian news service SANA. We have negotiated with them in different types of weapons for years, and Russia has committed itself to these contracts.
Moscow, however, had said that such deliveries would be in accordance with international law and had refused to supply Syria with weapons that could be used against civilians.
John Kerry, United States Secretary of State, described any transfer of S-300 to the region as unhelpful.
Whether it is an old contract or not, it has a profoundly negative impact on the balance of interests and stability in the region, and puts Israel at risk, he said.
Kerry added that stopping the bloodshed peacefully should be the top priority for everyone.
The best chance to save Syria - LRB- and -RRB- for a future Syria that represents all the Syrian people and goes beyond this massacre, devastation, killing, sectarian violence... is through a peaceful resolution that takes place in an organized manner, he said Friday at a joint press conference in Washington with German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle.
In Geneva, we're going to prove who's serious. Are the Russians seriously pushing that? I think they are. - LRB- But -RRB- it is not useful to have many other munitions, other supplies openly entering.

Crisis conference planned for Switzerland
He referred to an international conference on the crisis planned for Switzerland. The plans are being developed, but al-Assad predicted that it will take place in June.
We announced a couple of days ago that we agreed in principle to attend, he said.
But the Syrian leader made it clear that his position could change, and the Damascus delegation could withdraw, if certain conditions were imposed.
So the idea of the conference, of a meeting, in principle, is good, he told Al-Manar TV. We'll have to wait and see.
The National Coalition, the main rebel general group, has demanded that al-Assad step aside to participate in the talks, which were originally scheduled for this month.
It is difficult to continue when Syrians are constantly beaten by the Assad regime with the help of outside forces, said George Sabra, acting president of the National Coalition, in a statement.
He cited the siege of Qusayr and the attacks on East Gouta, a suburb of Damascus, as well as what he said was an invasion by Iranian militiamen in support of al-Assad.
Al-Assad said it is too early to discuss whether he will run for president again in the 2014 elections. I would if there is a need and a public desire for him to stay, but he will not if I feel that the Syrian people do not want me to guide them.
The Syrian president's only condition is that anything agreed to address the crisis should not be binding until the Syrians approve it through a popular referendum.
Either side can propose anything, but nothing can be implemented without the approval of the Syrian people. And as long as we are the legitimate representatives of the people, we have nothing to fear, the Syrian leader said.

Opposition group: 50 prisoners executed
All the agreements and talks have done little to change the situation on the ground in Syria.
The killing continued on Friday, and local opposition coordination committees reported 189 deaths, including six women, five children and 19 who died after being tortured.
There were 74 deaths in Aleppo province, including 50 prisoners who, according to the group, were executed by government forces in Aleppo central prison, the group said.
In addition, Syrian state television has reported that forces loyal to al-Assad killed three Westerners: an American woman, a British woman and a person whose nationality was not revealed.
The news media said Thursday that the three had been fighting alongside the rebels and were found with weapons. The report says they were ambushed in their car in Idlib province, northwestern Syria, where government forces have been fighting the rebels for control.
The TV video showed a car with bullets and three bodies lying on the ground. It also showed weapons, a computer, a hand-drawn map of a government military facility and a flag belonging to the Al-Nusra Front affiliated with Al Qaeda.
The United States is aware of the report on the murder of Americans and is working through the Czech Republic's mission to Syria to get more information, a State Department official told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Citing privacy concerns, the official said, “We can’t comment anymore.
Photos circulating online show the body of Nicole Lynn Mansfield, 33, from Flint, Michigan, her father and daughter told CNN on Friday.
The United Kingdom Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed that a British citizen was among the dead. His family has been informed and we are providing consular assistance, he said.
Kerry, America's top diplomat, said that between 1,500 and 2,000 U.S. fighters could be in Syria.
It's hard to set the exact number, he said.

"As for tennis Serena Williams clarified Wednesday the controversial comments she made in a magazine article on the role of the victim in the rape case of Steubenville, Ohio, which earned national headlines earlier this year.
In March, two high school football players were convicted of raping a drunk teenager at a party and posting photos of the incident online.
In a upcoming issue of Rolling Stone magazine, Williams talks about convicted rapists after a news report on the case appeared on a nearby TV screen during the interview. You think it was fair, what they got? They did something stupid, but I don't know. I'm not blaming the girl, but if you're a 16-year-old girl and you're drunk like this, your parents should teach you, ""Don't drink from other people,"" she told Rolling Stone.
Of the victim, Williams also says in the interview: She's 16 years old, why was she so drunk where she doesn't remember? It could have been a lot worse. You're lucky. Obviously, I don't know, maybe she wasn't a virgin, but she shouldn't have put herself in that position, unless she's slipped something, so that's different.
The comments, posted on Rolling Stone's website on Tuesday, immediately caused a storm of fire on social media, particularly on Twitter, where users punished the tennis star.
On Wednesday, Williams posted a statement on his website clarifying his comments.
What happened in Steubenville was a real shock to me. I was deeply sad. Someone being raped, and only at sixteen, it's such a horrible tragedy! For both families involved -- the rape victim's and the defendants', he wrote.
I am currently contacting the girl's family to let them know that I am deeply sorry for what was written in Rolling Stone's article. What was written -- what I supposedly said -- is insensitive and hurtful, and I would not in any way say or imply that she was the culprit, Williams added.
Stephen Rodrick, who wrote Rolling Stone's article, leans on his report, saying to the Poynter Institute: The interview is on tape. Other than that, I'll let history speak for itself.

"BP said on Sunday that it is satisfied with the way in which the operation of placing a new stop in its broken underwater well is proceeding.
Officers expect the containment cap to prevent oil from pouring into the Gulf. But while robots replace the old lid, crude flows freely.
The procedure, which is expected to take four to seven days, continued to progress on Sunday as teams worked to place a transition reel over the effusion well to prepare for the new connection, according to Kent Wells, Senior Vice President of BP.
“We are pleased how it goes,” Wells said, but warned that the operation, which began on Saturday with the removal of the old cap, is only on its second day.
Robots removed six giant bolts from the device early Sunday so that the new lid could be positioned.
If successful, the effects of the containment operation could stop the oil spill that began on April 20 after a deadly explosion on the Deepwater Horizon platform in the Gulf of Mexico.
But officials have said that the new containment cap would be a temporary solution, and the permanent solution would still be completing a relief well. There are two relief wells under construction.
Wells said Sunday that one of the relief wells could intercept the break-up by the end of July.
“We feel very good about how we have positioned ourselves so well,” he said.
The other relief well is expected to be completed in August.
The old cap had been diverting about 15,000 barrels a day - LRB- 630,000 gallons -RRB- to a boat. BP is still recovering 8,000 to 9,000 additional barrels per day - LRB- 336,000 to 378,000 gallons -RRB- via a line connected to another ship, the Q4000.
As we begin to increase the capacity for additional containment, we should see less and less flow, Wells said.
The recovery vessel Helix Producer is expected to start collecting oil on Sunday night, Wells said, and officials expect to reach their total collection capacity from 20,000 to 25,000 barrels - LRB- 840,000 to 1.5 million gallons -RRB- per day within three days.
Over the next two or three weeks, between 60,000 and 80,000 barrels - LRB- 2.52 million to 3.36 million gallons -RRB- a day must be collected as part of the containment process, Wells said. Scientists estimate that between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels of oil emit daily from the broken BP well.
BP says there will be a period of decrease in the capture of oil and gas from the well head during the replacement of the lid. He said another recovery vessel, the Q4000, should continue to capture and light oil and gas. There will be other recovery vessels and skiers deployed.
Two more oil skiers were added to Gulf Sunday, bringing the total to 48 collecting a mixture of oil and surface water, BP officials said. And another 15 burns were carried out in calm seas.
“It was a good day trying to contain the oil that came to the surface,” Wells said.
Wells also said there will be a significant measurement capability added to the new cap so that officials can get a good idea of the flow.
BP said in a statement that the new cap should improve containment efficiency during the hurricane season by allowing shorter disconnection and reconnection times.
Tad Allen said on Friday that the new cap would allow responders to collect more accurate oil flow data and that, once the switch is complete, the resulting capacity to contain oil will be much greater than the capabilities we have achieved using current systems.

"Veterans Day is an official holiday of the United States that is celebrated on November 11 of each year. As Memorial Day remembers those who have died while serving in any of the branches of the U.S. Armed Forces: Army, Navy, Marines, and Coast Guard, Veterans Day honors all members of the armed forces, especially the living. As a federal holiday in the United States, government offices and schools are closed, and most people have a day off from work. Banks are closed, too. If November 11 falls on a Sunday, then the party is observed on the following Monday.

The feast was first observed after World War I, which ended on November 11, 1918. It was then called Armistice Day and it was more about celebrating the absence of war and honoring those who served in that one war. It was not known as Veterans' Day until 1954 after World War II and the Korean War, when there were many more members of the armed forces.
Many restaurants offer free meals to veterans today. There is always a special ceremony at the Arlington National Military Cemetery in Washington, D.C. This ceremony involves a crown placed on the tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Many major cities also hold parades on this date. Usually the American flag is waved to half as a reminder of those soldiers who have died and many ceremonies observe a moment of silence for the same reason. In Canada the party is called Remembrance Day. A symbol of the day is the poppy flower. It is said that the red poppy flower represents or is a symbol of the blood of the soldiers. Many people use or give away poppy flowers in the day.",B2
"In 2005, when BlackBerry brought instant messages to the mobile phone, the company was just entering its booming times. While the iPhone remained a flash in Steve Jobs' eye, BlackBerry's innovations ensured that his smartphone was one of Canada's largest exports.
Six years later, in the summer of 2011, when violence enveloped London and spread to Birmingham, Nottingham, Liverpool and Manchester, BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) was so effective in mobilizing protesters that politicians called for the service to be temporarily shut down. But two years later, it is the users themselves who are pulling the plug. As demand for BlackBerry phones fades, the old, noisy BBM vine is falling silently. Dozens of alternatives have emerged to take their place, from Facebook and Apple's own instant messaging apps to independent start-ups like WhatsApp and Kik (which is also Canadian). Free to download and use, they use the Internet to exchange text messages, images, voice clips, stickers, and even videos in the case of WhatsApp, among most types of phones.
In an attempt to maintain its next, BBM has been released on Android and Apple phones. Despite the competition, the response has been overwhelming, with an announcement that there have been more than 20 million downloads. But, despite the initial interest, many believe that the broader version of BBM will do little to save the service.
“The move to take BlackBerry to the iPhone is four or five years too late,” says James Gooderson, an 18-year-old student blogging about technology. “WhatsApp has eliminated the reason why young people would use a BlackBerry.” BBM claims 80 million users a month after its update, but WhatsApp has 300 million. Other services expose the limitations of BBM: unlike Skype and Viber, it does not yet offer video or voice calls; unlike Path, it does not share location; there is no video exchange, such as in iMessage; and stickers (a more sophisticated version of the smiling face), adored by children around the world, are also unforgivably absent. Even contacts and the shared calendar that BBM made possible on BlackBerry phones have not migrated to versions of Apple and Android.
The messaging is moving from verbal to visual. Photos uploaded to Instagram trigger a wave of comments and Snapchat photos, which are deleted within ten seconds, have opened up a world of other possibilities. Like BBM, all these services are free of charge for any phone with Internet connection. However, in 2011, BBM was so powerful that it was attributed the start of a revolution in Egypt; and, at the time of the London riots, it was a more urgent news source than the television screen.
“We could see in our BlackBerry messages where the troublemakers were going; TV news would catch up four hours later,” said Jean-Pierre Moore, 28. He runs a youth club in Stockwell, South London, an area with some of the highest levels of crime and economic deprivation in Britain. Moore communicates mainly on an iPad now. It rejects the idea that the BBM curfew urged by some parliamentarians would have stopped the looting. “Social media was not the reason,” he says. “I know a lot of people who mutiny. People had been angry for a long time. Mention the words 'stop and search' here and immediately you have a room full of angry young people.""
Nearly 80% of young smartphone owners regularly use a social media app, says the research company Enders Analysis, but two-thirds use more than one. Among 16-24 year olds, 60% use Facebook every day, but 46% use alternatives. “It’s a much more complex and multifaceted environment,” says Benedict Evans, digital media specialist at Enders. “The smartphone itself has become the platform. All of these apps are connected to your phone book and photo library. Applications go up and down like fireworks. Some, like Instagram, last; others disappear into the air.”
Bennett, 13, has three devices, all hand-held by family members. He keeps his BlackBerry for messaging, uses an iPhone over wi-fi to play games and makes phone calls on an Android phone branded HTC. His friends are still at BBM – the four phone robberies at his school so far this term was all BlackBerrys. With just a few buttons, a single BlackBerry message can be sent to the entire phone owner's contact schedule – several hundred people in some cases; on WhatsApp, the limit for a transmission message is 50. But, for Bennett, Instagram is now an important social network. “Instagram is Facebook without parents,” he says. “Facebook has been taken over by the older generation. Once I saw my mother on Facebook, I deleted my account.”
For families who may have difficulty paying their heating bills this winter, the low price tag attached to buying and communicating on a BlackBerry retains its appeal. Unlimited BBM messages are available to anyone with a second-hand device and an offer of £7-per-month T-Mobile. But confidence in the privacy of the BBM system has eroded. Part of the attraction to entrepreneurs, revolutionaries, protesters and protesters was the belief that encrypted words sent over the company's secure servers could not be traced to their writers. The accusations after the riots ended that belief.
Across the city from Stockwell, outside the doors of a private school in South Kensington, older students have Apple logos on their phones. Everybody uses WhatsApp. For many, BBM is a distant memory. “I still have a Blackberry, but I’m the only one,” says a teenager standing with a circle of friends. And how does that make you feel? “Isolated,” he replies.

"Smoke cells and exhaust pipes around the world are throwing greenhouse gas emissions to a new annual high record. They should break 39 billion tons this year.
But there is also good news, said a new study published on Tuesday. The rate at which people are polluting the air may be stabilizing.
In the West, emissions contributing to global warming even declined last year.
The United States pumped 3.7 % less carbon dioxide into the air in 2012 than the previous year; Europe, 1.8 % less.
Globally, greenhouse gases are emitted at a slower rate this year than last year, and in both years the increase in emissions was less intense than in the last decade as a whole, researchers from the Eastern Anglia University of Britain said.
Judges will review the regulation of greenhouse gases
Falling into the cube
It's an improvement, but a drop in the cube by global emission standards.
Greenhouse gases are blowing into the atmosphere at rates above 61% of those in 1990, the reference year of the Kyoto Protocol.
The international agreement is designed to reduce emissions that contribute to global warming by keeping its signatories to the reduction targets. The vast majority of the nations of the world have signed it.
America is not one of them.
China is.
But the world’s largest carbon emitter, which snatched the dubious title of the United States in recent years, threw 5.9% more into the atmosphere in 2012 than in the previous year.
India contributed 7.7 per cent more emissions in 2012.
On the Road to Catastrophe
Researchers said that not only should the increase be stopped, but industrialized countries should achieve a global reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
Time is running out to prevent the world from reaching a frightening threshold of global warming.
The world is on a course with current emission levels to reach an increase in global temperatures of 2 degrees Celsius or more and end up in the worst climate change scenario issued by the United Nations climate change panel.
The study includes a carbon atlas, which shows the levels of pollution emitted by each nation and its development over the last 50 years.
In 2012, the main contributors of greenhouse gases were China, with 27%, the United States, with 14% and the European Union, with 10%.
Individually, China and the EU were at the same level, with 7.7 tonnes of carbon gas emitted per person per year.
Americans continue to pollute most by far, with more than 17 tons of carbon gas emitted per person in 2012.

"More than half a million people a year flock to the Blue Mountains National Park, Australia's most accessible desert, to see its impressive peaks and ancient rainforest.
But Australia is dealing with a dilemma: how to balance conservation with the need for tourism spending.
Although it looks beautiful and beautiful, it is a park under pressure, there are many vulnerable species in this national park, said Tara Cameron, local professor and president of the Blue Mountains Conservation Society.
It is not a completely resistant piece of nature with which we can do anything.
Keeping the desert is an expensive business, and the number of visitors has decreased in recent years.
The number of trips including a night stay has almost halved in the last decade, from 1,045 million in 1999, according to figures from Tourism Research Australia cited in the Sydney Daily Telegraph.
They show a fall of 18 percent in a year, from 687,000 in 2008 to 563,000 last year.
The New South Wales government now wants to increase both the number of tourists and spending by attracting visitors interested in a more comfortable and less robust experience.
His tourism strategy has attracted criticism for refusing to rule out development within the park.
Mark Jarvis, who runs a hotel in Katoomba, the main tourist city of the Blue Mountains, just an hour and a half away from Sydney, said: ""We are very concerned because the uniqueness of the area revolves around the fact that we sit among World Heritage parks.
So the fact that they're looking for development, the fact that if there's a potential to do it, it's not right for this area.
It is not in Sydney's interest to see this area develop; the attraction for the people of Sydney to come here is our lack of development.
Cameron agreed: What I see happening in New South Wales is a distraction and distraction away from nature conservation as the main purpose of parks -- and if we don't focus on that standards and the state of our parks will slowly decline.
However, Randal Walker, president of Blue Mountains Tourism, argued that it is possible to develop sustainable tourism without damaging the natural beauty that visitors come to see.
If there was a greater interest in development, I think those investors would only do so in terms of: is it sustainable? He said Walker. Is there going to be a return on investment? And it's going to be in built-up areas where zoning allows it. I do not think there is any development that has a negative impact on the environment.
We have to have a sustainable impact on the natural asset, which all tour operators value and value and want to conserve.
Penelope Figgis, government advisor on conservation and tourism, also believes that the park has to develop.
She said: Everyone is looking for how we can make national parks relevant in the future. We have a very urbanized population that is not so connected to nature.
The New South Wales government wanted to see how we could connect with nature, but at the same time stimulate regional economies through nature conservation-related tourism activities.
I cannot think of a better way to persuade someone to be a defender of a beautiful and wild area than to go there and dive into that experience, he added.
The danger in this quest for something new, is to turn nature into a commodity, Cameron argued.
I think national parks and nature are worth more than being the new, the new kind of product, he said.
We have 92 percent of the state of New South Wales that is occupied by the people.
Only eight percent is national park. It's the parts that we've put aside for nature -- do we really need to invade them as well?
The cafeteria is not an endangered species. Humans are doing great, we're taking good care of ourselves. At some point we have to say: When is the turn of nature?

"-LRB-CNN-RRB- Syria is a Hell on Earth that is expanding in plain sight.
The death toll has doubled in a year, if an opposition group is right.
Since the outbreak of the civil war, 310,000 people have been killed, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory said on Thursday. A year earlier, the SOHR figure was 162,402. And last year, the United Nations made the death toll out of 70,000.
The violence has plunged more than half of Syrians into poverty so that they urgently need help to survive, according to the United Nations, as food rations are being cut due to a lack of donations.
Only numbers cannot transmit the immeasurable anguish of millions, but perhaps it can remind the rest of us of the magnitude of the world's greatest current tragedy.
The number of years since the perpetual bloodshed began, since the security forces of dictator Bashar al-Assad shot at crowds of demonstrators and armed militant groups rose up against him in March 2011.
Percentage of Syrian population killed. It would be like killing 3 to 4 million Americans. The range comes from the number of SOHR deaths of 310,000 and a recent lower estimate by the UN of at least 220,000 deaths.
The number of Syrians who need immediate help to save lives, according to the UN That is the population of Moscow.
Syrians expelled from their homes, says the UN. Imagine the entire empty Boston metropolitan area.
Syrians who have fled as refugees to neighbouring countries, creating humanitarian and economic difficulties across Syria's borders. Turkey has taken 1.7 million, Lebanon 1.2 million, Jordan 625,000 and Iraq 245,000.
The reduction in the size of food rations that the World Food Programme says it has been forced to do because of the lack of donations. This means that people who receive help will receive only 60% of the daily nutrition they need.

"Leaving his car, the wife of a government worker with permission walked into a small building full of free food.
He approached the door with his head down. A stewardess asked for his name, looked up and began to cry.
“It’s okay, it’s not your fault,” the volunteer said as she wrapped her arms around the woman crying.
Chesapeake Cares Food Pantry, located 30 miles from the political impasse in Washington that resulted in the closure, collected a gift of adapted food for the affected workers who are not in their jobs and receive no remuneration.
About 200 people received bags of frozen meat, canned vegetables and other commodities on Monday morning.
These people - LRB- government employees with permission -RRB- do not know how to be poor, Rev. Robert Hahn, the head of End Hunger in Calvert County, a consortium of food bakeries in the area. These people are fish out of the water and feel humiliated, as if they had lost their dignity.
This is the second offer Hahn's group has made to federal employees. Last week, the group distributed 2,700 pounds of food to 71 different families. And if the government's closure continues, Hahn said he anticipates that his group will continue with this kind of offerings.
The closure that began on October 1 has impacted hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors in the Washington region, including people at the epicenter of the party confrontation of the shutdown in Congress.
The food banks in the Washington area have responded to an unexpected need created this fall by the closure, their already proven efforts for a continuous and uneven economic recovery and a hard labour market.
Men and women were on both sides of the aid on Monday in Calvert County, who received and distributed food.
Those who helped included one person working for the Department of Justice and one person employed by the Navy.
CNN agreed not to identify workers with permission who received food due to a combination of their shame and not wanting to hurt their employer.
“Receive payment help, but it doesn’t help right now,” one said, acknowledging that he will probably be paid once the closure is over.
Still, the woman said she was struggling to put food on the table.
Some told CNN they were living paycheck to paycheck.
The biggest thing - LRB - that people feel -RRB - is fear, Hahn said. Even a lot of federal employees who know they're going to make their checks, they're still going to be shy if they miss a couple of pay periods.
President Barack Obama visited a food pantry in downtown Washington on Monday, where he helped make peanut butter sandwiches.
He told reporters that he stopped at Martha's Table because many of the volunteers there had been discharged.
They are here contributing and surrendering to the community and I think that demonstrates the kind of spirit we have among all kinds of federal workers across the country, people who dedicate their lives to public service, Obama said.
Hahn, who has worked for the Chesapeake Church for 20 years, said that many of the men and women he saw picking up food on Monday were new faces that had never sought his help in the past.
While a Main Street study showed that Calvert County was the 13th richest county in the United States in 2012, Hahn said the ranking does not show how many poor workers live in the area.
It's a damn shame, Maryland government. Martin O'Malley told CNN. It's not his fault, but now they're in a position to, to have to come here for help.
O'Malley, who attended the event, said he would recommend that those who for ideological reasons feel that closing our government is a good idea to come here and see the families who are appearing for help feeding their families for the first time in their lives.
As volunteers spread food, there was obvious frustration with political leaders in Washington.
Those in line lamented the fact that they were expected to run out of pay.
Hahn said he had more important things to do than worry about how things will shake at the Capitol.
I would say this to the president and Congress, your job is to solve problems, not to create problems, Hahn said. We're here to solve problems.

"In 2010, the old city of Srinagar was the kind of place where the police would only venture to wear armor. A bulwark for violent separatists waving for an independent Kashmir was the center of uprisings that left more than 100 people dead, buried together with dreams of peace in the mountainous region of northern India.
How fast things change. Now carefree tourists line up on the same streets for the roast lamb tikka and rogan josh steam dishes. The Nowhatta mosque, where in the summer of 2010 young people would gather after Friday prayers to throw stones at security forces, will become part of an official walking tour focused on heritage, crafts and markets. In Dal Lake, the houseboats have been booked months in advance. In the stunning gardens bordering the green slopes of the lake, visitors can take a photo with one of the most beautiful backgrounds in Asia. Until the snow melted, nearby ski resorts were also filled with rich Russians.
In 2002, only just over 27,000 tourists dared to visit the Kashmir Valley, frightened by the anti-Indian insurgency, which has claimed up to 70,000 lives. So far in 2012, the area has received almost a million tourists, more than 23,000 of them from outside India. But among them there were less than 150 British, largely because the UK Ministry of Foreign Affairs refuses to change its somewhat chilling advice, which deters most travellers by providing a list of recent security incidents in the region.
Omar Abdullah, the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, born in the United Kingdom, has pressured the British High Commission in Delhi to relax the guidelines, but in vain. “It’s a source of frustration,” admitted Abdullah, who has been in charge of India’s most sensitive state since early 2009. “Today, unfortunately, as a result of that travel notice, people’s insurance is null and void when they visit here.” The last published case of foreign tourists killed in J&K was in 1995, when six Westerners, including two British, were abducted by Al-Faran, an Islamist militant group in Kashmir. Only one escaped with his life.
“They have killed British citizens more recently in countries that have not yet prevented people from visiting. I mean, how many British citizens did you lose on 9/11? Did you keep people from visiting New York? You have lost them in Spain, in Bali; tell me where you haven’t lost them,” Abdullah said. “We lost Indians in London. There is still the possibility that Al-Qaida can do something stupid as they have done in the past, but we have not prevented the Indians from travelling to London. There is no reason to point to Jammu and Kashmir, or even Srinagar, as an insecure fate.”
Germany relaxed its guidelines for those planning to travel to the region in 2011. “Foreigners are generally not the direct target of clashes,” the amended German council advised. At that time, it was seen by many outsiders as a bold movement, coming less than a year after the 2010 riots finally died out. A national holiday on August 15 marked 65 years of Indian independence – in the past, a day full of dangers in a state where many do not feel part of the greatest democracy in the world. But this time in the independence celebrations there were no problems.
Abdullah insists that tourists are safe in the state, “as long as you take the kind of precautions you would normally take. ” In other words, do not go trekking near the border separating the controlled Indian and Pakistani parts of J&K. Syed Ali Shah Geelani, leader of the pro-Kashmiri independence party, disagrees with much of Abdullah's policy. But on the subject of tourism, the two are united. At the beginning of the summer season, Geelani wrote an open letter to tourists and pilgrims saying: “Whatever your faith, whatever language you speak and whatever region you belong to, we are bound by a common bond, the bond of humanity. You are our guest of honor – respecting and protecting guests is not only our moral obligation, but an article of faith.”
Some visitors may worry about the ethics of having fun in a place with a population suffering from record levels of anxiety and mental health problems. But all the locals we talked to in Srinagar were heartily in favour of tourism. Amjid Gulzar, 26, said Abdullah could seek truth and reconciliation, as well as encourage foreign visitors. “It has to do both; but without tourism, our economy will be in chaos,” he said, adding that while welcoming the millions of tourists who visited this year, Kashmir had to do more to attract visitors at great expense, especially foreigners.
“We need better infrastructure, better roads, reliable electricity. We need more for tourists to do at night: we don’t even have a cinema in this city and there isn’t enough for tourists to do after night,” he said. But will tourists feel welcome? In June, a local Islamic group published a “dress code” for foreign tourists. Abdullah sighs at the mention of that fury. “No one expects tourists to come here and cover their faces. I think what they were talking about was shorts and sleeveless vests, which even then wouldn't be something that would attract too much attention... I think the basic point they were doing was to be sensitive to our cultural identity and dress properly. I think that’s common sense.”
Abdullah said he was on a tourist campaign “for no reason other than the fact that I need to stimulate economics. ” J&K's finances are in a terrible state after more than two decades of turmoil. The state receives only 72 million pounds a year in taxes, and yet the salary of the 500,000 public employees is 155 million pounds, he said. It's clear why you need to find more funds, fast. For now, however, he is cautiously pleased to see the tourists back. “I’m not suggesting that because we’ve had a million tourists here that’s a sign of normalcy,” he said. “But it gives me some satisfaction that people can come, have a good time and come back.”

"Not all parents wait for the day their child goes to school. In fact, some parents are not sending their students to school at all. Instead, they are choosing to teach their children at home. This is called home school. Private parents, caregivers or guardians educate children individually at home rather than send them to be formally educated in public or private schools. In the U.S. Only about three percent of children are educated at home.

There are many reasons why some parents choose school at home. One reason is that some parents do not feel that their children are safe in school due to bullying and a growing trend of the police in school. Other parents want their children's education to be based on their religion or moral beliefs. However, other parents feel that school education is not good enough. Home education is also considered an option for families living in rural areas and families travelling, such as actors.
There are many different ways of school at home, and home school allows parents to customize lessons according to their children's needs. Families can buy textbooks to use or create their own materials. Some parents follow a philosophy called non-schooling, which allows the child to determine when and how they want to learn based on their natural curiosity. Some worry that home school means that students will not have opportunities to socialize. To respond to this concern, some families have created cooperatives, where a group of students studying at home will learn and play together and participate in activities that usually happen at school such as field trips and dance.
Being educated at home doesn't mean a student can't go to college. Most universities accept students at home. However, it is important for parents and students to create a portfolio or proof of what has been learned.",B2
"As a psychiatrist, former university president and defender of Arab women in science, Rafia Ghubash is one of the most influential women in the United Arab Emirates.
But his latest project is possibly his most ambitious so far: the creation of the first museum in the Middle East dedicated to women's achievements.
The museum, Bait al Banaat, or Women's House, in Dubai, was officially opened in late 2012 by Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, showing women's contribution to the country's history.
The women here were empowered a long time ago, but they haven't had a chance to tell our story, Ghubash said. Don't think that because we're covered we're not empowered.
The women here were not in the media, but they were economically engaged and ran businesses.
The museum is the culmination of five years of work for Ghubash, who financed the museum with $3 million of his own money.
For me it was a full-time job, but I had 20 volunteers of all nationalities working with me in their free time. It was nice having people with different backgrounds involved, he said.
Looking for a house for the museum, Ghubash rejected a free site in Dubai's official heritage district for an old house in the historic Gold Souk neighborhood where he grew up.
I was looking for a place to build and I found a very old house that I remember from childhood, he said. It used to be called Bait al Banaat because three single women lived there. Something about the name came to life for me.
Ghubash said his generation of grandmothers contributed much more to politics, economy, education and literature in the region than has been recognized.
Arianna Huffington says to women: Less stress, more life '
The museum contains a room dedicated to the Emirati poet Ousha Bint Khalifa, known as the Arabian Girl, a gallery dedicated to temporary art exhibitions, a collection of Arab fragrances and oils, traditional jewelry and a women's study centre.
It was very important for me to present the museum in the best possible way to attract a younger generation. “I want you to enjoy your culture and heritage,” Ghubash said.
Ghubash, 56, has undertaken the museum project while taking a sabbatical year of a career that led her to be included in the 36th edition of Arabian Business magazine of 100 most powerful Arab women in 2011.
He grew up in Dubai in a family where he was encouraged to study.
It came from a family where both parents made sure there were books available in the house, he said. I was free to read and think for myself.
Ghubash was trained as a doctor at Cairo University and for a doctorate in London, before returning to the United Arab Emirates as an assistant professor of psychiatry.
In 2001, she became president of the Arabian Gulf University in Bahrain, a position she held until 2009.
She also founded the Arab Network of Women in Science and Technology, and served as its president for four years.
My journey in life is very interesting, he said. I was focusing on becoming a doctor and practicing as a psychiatrist.
Recently, I was attracted to something different: history and culture.
Having achieved his goal at the opening of the museum, Ghubash is not content with rest and delight in glory. He is already working on his next project to compile an encyclopedia of women in the United Arab Emirates.

"An octopus has made a brazen escape from the National Aquarium in New Zealand as it exits its tank, sliding through a 50-meter drainage tube and disappearing into the sea.
In scenes reminiscent of Finding Nemo, Inky - a common octopus of New Zealand - made his career for freedom after the lid of his tank was accidentally left slightly ajar. The staff believes that in the middle of the night, while the aquarium was deserted, Inky stayed to the top of his glass enclosure, on the side of the tank and traveled through the aquarium floor.
Rob Yarrell, national manager of the National Aquarium of New Zealand in Napier, said: “Octopus are famous escape artists. I don't think he was unhappy with us, or lonely, since octopus are solitary creatures. But he's a very curious boy. He'd want to know what's going on outside. That’s just his personality.”
One theory is that Inky slipped through the aquarium floor - a trip of three or four meters - and then, the sense of freedom was at hand, in a drain that led directly to the sea. The drain was 50 meters long and opened towards the waters of Hawke Bay, on the east coast of the northern island of New Zealand.
Another possible escape route could have involved Inky by pressing an open pipe at the top of his tank, which led under the ground to the drain. “When we arrived the next morning and his tank was empty, I was very surprised,” said Yarrell, who has not started a search for Inky. “The staff and I have been pretty sad. But then, this is Inky and it has always been a surprise octopus.”
Reiss Jenkinson, in charge of the exhibitions at the National Aquarium, said he was absolutely certain that Inky had not been taken. “I understand very well the nature of octopus behavior,” he said. “I’ve seen octopus on ships slide through bilge bombs. And is security here too tight for someone to take to Inky and why would they do it?
Because octopus do not have bones, they are able to fit in extremely small spaces and have been filmed pressing through holes the size of coins. They are also understood to be extremely intelligent and capable of using tools. At the Wellington Island Bay Marine Education Centre, it was discovered that an octopus had the habit of visiting another tank during the night to steal crabs and then return to its own place. Another in the center, Ozymandias, was believed to have broken a world record to open a jar before being thrown into the ocean.
Inky was taken to the National Aquarium several years ago by a local fisherman who found him trapped in a pot of crabs. He had scars and ""look rough,"" with shortened limbs, Yarrell said. “I had been living on the reef and struggling with the fish so I wasn’t in the best shape.” According to Yarrell, Inky – which is the size of a rugby ball – was an “unusually smart” octopus. “He was very kind, very curious and a popular attraction here. We have another octopus, Blotchy, but it's smaller than Inky and Inky had the personality.
The aquarium has no plans to increase safety as a result of the leak, as Inky was a “uni-off”, but the staff is “increasingly aware of what octopus can do.” Although the aquarium is not actively looking for a replacement for Inky, if a fisherman brought another octopus, he might be willing to accept it. “You never know,” Yarrell said. There's always a chance Inky can come home with us.

"A cardinal from the Philippines, another from Austria and an archbishop from Ireland would be the worst options for being the next Pope, according to a group representing victims of abuse by priests.
The Network of Survivors Abused by Priests, or SNAP, published their list on Thursday as cardinals who met in the Vatican in a prelude to the selection of the next pontiff.
The three are Cardinal Luis Tagle of the Philippines; Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn of Austria; and Archbishop Diarmuid Martin of Dublin, Ireland.
Martin is not a cardinal, but SNAP pointed out that a man does not need to be a cardinal to be elected Pope. Historically, the role has passed to the cardinals, however.
CNN analyst at the Vatican, John Allen, also a National Catholic Reporter correspondent, wrote last month that Schoenborn certainly has the right pedigree for the job.
And Tagle has been a leader in pressuring the church in Asia to take an aggressive stance on clerical abuse, Allen said in a series he wrote about papal contenders.
Tagle would normally be considered too young for the role, but Benedict XVI's almost unprecedented resignation could have changed the cardinals' thinking, he said.
On Wednesday, the SNAP named its Dirty Dozen list of men whom it judged to be the worst candidates for the Pope due to their handling or comments on past allegations of child sexual abuse against the clergy.
The scandal has shaken global trust in the church in recent years.
A Pew Research Center poll published on Wednesday indicates that American Catholics see it as the greatest problem facing the Vatican.
When asked what is the most important problem, 34% of the American Catholics questioned mentioned sexual abuse, paedophilia, or some other reference to scandal. No other problem obtained more than 10% of the answers.
A report for the Italian news magazine Panorama on Thursday states that the church hierarchy was alerted to the problem decades ago, in 1965, but buried the warnings.
`Absolutely key '
Since Monday, the assembled cardinals have been holding meetings, known as general congregations, to discuss the most serious issues facing the church.
The last of the cardinals summoned to elect the next Pope, Jean-Baptiste Pham Minh Man of Vietnam, arrived at the Vatican on Thursday.
No date has been set for the conclave, or secret election, for the new Pope, said Rev. Federico Lombardi, Vatican spokesman.
But Cardinal Roger Mahony, the retired Archbishop of Los Angeles, suggested that the announcement would not be far off in a tweet published on Thursday.
Days of General Congregations coming to a conclusion. Date set for the nearby conclave. The mood of excitement prevails among the cardinals, he said.
The 115 cardinal-electors -- those under 80 who are eligible to vote for the new pontiff -- are taking time to prepare for what many see as their greatest responsibility.
Although some wonder why it is taking so long to set the date for the conclave, Lombardi opposed the idea that the cardinals were dragging their feet.
The discussions they are having in the general congregations are a vital part of the process, he said, as once the conclave begins there is not much time among the vows for reflection or exchange of ideas.
Cardinals have to have all the information they need to make a mature and responsible judgment in the election, especially at a time when the church faces complex problems, he said. Preparation is absolutely key, Lombardi said.
Celibacy for priests is a burning issue, not just for church leaders.
The cardinals of the United States. gagged?
The Italian media reports focused on Thursday on the Vatican's decision to end the briefings held this week by American cardinals, amid concern over leaks of confidential discussions among cardinals.
Sister Mary Ann Walsh, director of media relations at the Conference of Catholic Bishops of the United States, wrote on a blog that Wednesday's decision came after a media report in the Italian newspaper La Stampa, which gave details of who had said what.
I compared the closure to the old Catholic school style of a child speaks and everyone stays after school, he wrote, saying something similar happened before the last conclave in 2005.
We will continue the briefings, but without cardinals, to help the U.S. media especially cover this exciting time in the church, Walsh added.
It has been a week since Benedict XVI became the first pontiff in six centuries to renounce the role. Popes usually serve until their death.
With Easter around the corner, many within the Catholic Church would like to see a new pontiff in place to lead ceremonies.
Watch out for smoke: How do you choose a new Pope?
`Mix and mix '
All cardinals, including those over 80, have the right to participate in the general closed congregations.
Lombardi said 152 cardinals met on Thursday morning. A second meeting will take place in the afternoon, as the cardinals try to resume the rhythm before agreeing the date for the conclave.
Thursday morning's affairs included reports on the financial status of the Holy See, Lombardi said. He appointed the cardinals who handed over the reports but did not reveal their content.
The cardinals could continue their meetings on Saturday, Lombardi added, but it is unlikely that they will meet on Sunday when mass can be celebrated.
Interactive: A look at possible papal contenders
Some of the discussions take place on coffee, as a Vatican spokesman revealed on Monday, the first day of the general congregations.
There is a coffee break for about 30 minutes in a special buffet area at the front of the audience room, Rev. Thomas Rosica. Cardinals have the opportunity to come down, mix and mix.
They mean what the next Pope will hear, because he is probably in that room, and they also want to alert people who have not spent so much time in Rome just what the situation is really here, as they see it, said Cardinal Francis George of Chicago.
Voters also want to enter the conclave with fairly clear ideas about who to vote for, said Boston's Cardinal Sean O'Malley. They, too, have no interest in seeing it continue, and there is no reason to believe that it will.
The last 11 conclaves have not lasted more than four days, wrote the diocese of Providence, Rhode Island, on its website.
That wasn't always the case. In the thirteenth century, the election of a pope took two years and nine months, the diocese said. Catholics were so angry with the cardinal's decision from 1268 to 1271, when Gregory X was elected, they boarded them in his chamber and pulled up the ceiling to expose them to the elements.
The fiasco led to the creation of the conclave and its precise protocol, in part to speed up the process.

The hijacking of aircraft, or the hijacking of aircraft, is the intentional taking of an aircraft usually done for political purposes. Unlike the hijacking of land vehicles, which is mostly done for financial gain, aerial hijacking is a darker, more dangerous and life-threatening action. Between the mid-60s and the mid-70s, about 160 planes were hijacked all over the world. In the United States, many had taken control of the aircraft, but no one had ever escaped within the reach of law enforcement, with a clear exception, D.B. Cooper.

D.B. Cooper's real name is Dan Cooper, but his legend started as D.B. Cooper for a media mistake in 1971. On November 24, Cooper hijacked a Boeing 727 aircraft after buying a one-way ticket from Portland to Seattle, Washington. Cooper demanded $200,000, and four parachutes to be delivered upon arrival in Seattle. Authorities complied with their ransom request, and Cooper let the 36 passengers and most of the crew get off the plane at that time.
Once back in the air, Cooper directed the pilot to fly to Mexico, but the fuel from the plane was not enough to get there without stopping to refuel. It was decided to land in Reno, Nevada to refuel. When the plane arrived in Reno, Cooper was not on board. Cooper is believed to have jumped off the plane somewhere in the wooded forests of Oregon. He had ordered the plane to fly at the lowest possible speed, and to fly at only 10,000 feet high. The legend of D.B. Cooper was born.
To date, the aerial hijacking of Cooper is the only case that has not been resolved in the United States. Cooper was never found, nor any proof of the $200,000, and his parachute. Many believe that Cooper could not survive such an altitude drop, while others say that the absence of money, or any evidence of his death proves that he survived. Anyway, D.B. Cooper's a real American legend.",B2
"A California Republican official has apologized for sending an email that represents President Barack Obama as a young chimpanzee.
To my American compatriots and everyone else who has seen the email I sent and who was offended by my action, I humbly apologize and ask for your forgiveness of my reckless behavior, Marilyn Davenport said in a statement obtained by CNN.
Davenport, who is a Tea Party activist and an elected member of the central committee of the Orange County Republican Party, said he felt that email was a joke, reported CNN affiliate KTLA.
The email contains a retouched photo of what appears to be a family portrait of two adult chimpanzees posing with a young chimpanzee with Obama's face stuck on it.
The legend that was posted with the photo says Now you know why no birth certificate, reported the affiliate.
Davenport said he would not repeat his mistake in the apology that included two Bible passages.
I am an imperfect Christian woman who does everything possible to live an honest life like that of Christ, the statement said. I would never do anything to harm or reprimand others intentionally, regardless of ethnicity. So I'm sorry, because I'm really sorry.
Despite criticism, Davenport told the affiliate that he does not need to give up his position due to email.
Scott Baugh, chairman of the Orange County Republican Party, said he was surprised by the email.
There is no doubt that email is racist. The only question is what was in Marilyn's heart, what was her intention. But I don't think there's anyone on his committee or in the world who doesn't see him as racist, Baugh said on CNN's AC360.
Baugh said he thinks Davenport should quit.
The conclusion is to be sorry for something and to have a sincere apology does not undo the action, does not stop the consequences, Baugh said. There are still consequences for what you have done and what you have done will continue to bring controversy to my party, so I am inclined to think right now that I should still resign from the committee.

"Dear Mr./Miss,
I am writing to express my dismay at the service at your Eden Hill branch on Saturday, January 14.
I often pick up prescriptions from the pharmacy on behalf of my grandmother, Mrs. Elaine Bingham. On this occasion there were two recipes: one for 10 x 50 mg Kendomol and one for 50 x 100 mg Leoprona. They served me quickly even though there seemed to be only one service pharmacist. When I left, however, I saw that I had been given 500 mg of Kendomol tablets. This is ten times stronger than prescription requires.
If I hadn't noticed the difference between the prescription and the actual tablets, my grandmother might have taken a dangerous overdose of Kendomol. I'd worry about getting future recipes in Eden Hill.
The pharmacist apologized and corrected the mistake, but wanted to get his attention. I think it happened because there wasn't enough service personnel. I understand that mistakes happen, but there must be a minimum of two pharmacists at all times so that all recipes can be checked.
I hope you can take steps to ensure that this mistake does not happen again.
Sincerely,
Roger Bingham",B2
"Critics of the 2015 Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens have called the film non-original and predictable because the story so closely reflects the first Star Wars movie in 1977. But, in fact, both films follow a structure that precedes all Hollywood films, the 'myth hero'. That's because director George Lucas based Star Wars on the ideas of Joseph Campbell's 1949 book, The Hero with a Thousand Faces. The later editions of Campbell's book even included Star Wars hero Luke Skywalker on the cover.
In his book, Campbell analyzes myths from all over the world to describe the ""monomitto"", a pattern that can be seen in the myths of all cultures. In short, a hero leaves home on a journey, where he overcomes obstacles and defeats enemies to return with a prize. It is a story that has been told for thousands of years, from the ancient Greeks with The Odyssey to JK Rowling's Harry Potter books.
George Lucas was one of the first film directors to base his story directly on the 17 stages of the hero's journey. Typically the hero begins the story by living an ordinary life, but something happens that calls them to an adventure that changes everything. At the start of Star Wars, Luke lives an ordinary life with his aunt and uncle, repairing robots. When you find Princess Leia's message to Obi-Wan Kenobi within the R2D2 robot, it is 'the call to adventure' that initiates the hero on his journey.
According to Campbell, the hero at first rejects the call to adventure, but appears a mentor who helps them and decides to ""cross the threshold"" and travel to the ""special world"" where the adventure occurs. The next stage is to pass the tests, fight the enemies and meet friends as the hero prepares to face his greatest challenge. For Luke the mentor is, of course, Obi-Wan, the friends are Han Solo and the robots R2D2 and C3PO and the enemy is Darth Vader within the special world of the Death Star.
Then the hero overcomes the obstacles on the way to facing his greatest challenge. Often comes a time when they face death or loss and that experience gives them the strength to finally defeat the enemy. Luke loses his mentor when he sees Darth Vader kill Obi-Wan, which helps him find the strength he needs later. When heroes succeed, they return from the special world, changed by their experiences forever. Luke's change comes when he remembers that Obi-Wan said, 'Use strength,' and uses it to help him point his laser at the heart of the Death Star. Luke takes his first steps to become a Jedi, and the hero's myth is rebooted in The Return of the Jedi, except this time his mentor is Yoda.",B2
"Steve Jobs was a self-made billionaire who brought personal computers to the homes of almost every American in the country. It is credited with the development of technology that has customized computers. Jobs, along with his childhood friend Steve Wozniak, co-founded Apple Computers in 1976, working in Jobs' garage.

Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, to parents who gave him up for adoption shortly after his birth. It was adopted by Clara and Paul Jobs. His father was an engineer who liked to spend time with his son dismantling electronic components and rebuilding them. This is when and where Jobs developed his interest in mechanical reconstruction. Jobs wasn't the best student in high school. He was known as a class clown, although he was very smart. It was in high school that he met Wozniak.
Both Jobs and Wozniak had a great interest in electronics, and the pair was known to make computer technology smaller, cheaper and more accessible to average people. Jobs began working as a video game designer for the Atari Corporation. Once Jobs launched Apple, he sold his first computers, which were called Apple I, for $666.66 each. Apple I won jobs almost $800,000 its first year, and that was just the beginning. Apple II won the budding company nearly $140 million, and by 1980, the company was worth $1.2 billion.
Jobs expanded his financial realm by venturing into other businesses such as Pixar Animation Studios, which was also very successful. He briefly left Apple to found the NeXT Corporation, which produced both software and hardware, but NeXT failed, and Jobs returned to Apple to develop iPhone and iPad. Jobs was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003, and finally lost his battle against cancer in October 2011.",B2
"In June, Diane visited her friends living in San Francisco, California. This was Diane's first time in town, and she enjoyed her opportunities to walk and explore.
On the first day of his trip, Diane visited the Golden Gate Bridge. This red suspension bridge measures 1.7 miles in length. Diane and her friends didn't cross the bridge. However, they saw it from the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, which offers hiking trails, picnic areas, and presents spectacular views of the bridge and the city. Diane and her friends made sure to take a group photograph here, with the bridge at the bottom.
The next day, Diane and her friends visited the island of Alcatraz. This island is located 1.25 miles from the coast in San Francisco Bay. He used to serve as a lighthouse, military fort and prison. Diane and her friends took a small touristic boat across the bay to reach the island. His visit included a guided tour through the former military base and the prison. They also took a walk around the island to appreciate some of the native fauna, in addition to the views of the city.
Diane and her friends spent the last day of their visit in the downtown area of San Francisco. Diane's favorite part of her entire trip was to take a cart to transport her through the mountainous streets of San Francisco. Diane did a lot of shopping downtown on her last day. She and her friends celebrated the end of their visit by dining in one of the best restaurants in San Francisco.",B2
"The women's continued relegation to the ranks of football was well kicked when France appointed its first professional director. It didn't matter if it was a second division club. It didn't matter if it was, like some bad sports – male, of course – suggested, just a cynical trick to increase advertising for a minor team, Clermont Foot 63, which currently ranks 14 out of 20 in its league.
What mattered was that Helena Costa had received the first place, a movement that saw her make history of football by becoming the first female manager to be named in the two highest divisions of any European professional league. “As a woman, it has made me happy,” said Véronique Soulier, president of the club’s supporters’ association, to journalists. “When I first heard the news, I was quite surprised, but once it happened, we were quite unanimous that it was good news. We all agree that a woman at the head of a group of men is not a bad thing.”
The new manager of Clermont Foot 63, whose average crowd at the stadium in Clermont- Ferrand in the Auvergne region in central-south France is about 3,800, is a former talent observer for the Celtic side of the Scottish Premiership. Costa, 36, was born in Alhandra, on the Tagus River, southeast of Portugal, and graduated with a master's degree in sports science. She is also a licensed UEFA coach. Previously he trained the male youth teams of Benfica, the Qatari women's team, which led to his first international victory in 2012, and, more recently, the Iranian women's national side, which he left in September 2013.
Costa was named in a two-year contract by Clermont Foot 63's president, Claude Michy, who is a champion in hoarding the headlines of his club. In 2013, he announced that the team had signed Messi. They did. Not the Argentine striker and FC Barcelona Lionel Messi, but Junior Messi Enguene, a 20-year-old midfielder from Cameroon.
Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, France’s Minister of Women’s Affairs, tweeted: “Bravo to Clermont Foot to understand that giving women a place is the future of professional football.”
Carolina Morace, an Italian woman who was the only former coach of a male professional team, said: “I don’t know Helena, but if she has been hired by a team, then it means she knows how to do her job. I hope that, one day, this can become normal.” Morace was a prominent player in the women's game. He was the top scorer for 12 seasons in Italy's A Series and played for Italy in 153 internationals. In 1999, she was named coach of Viterbese in the male C1 Series. But, after only two games, he quit work after a clash with the club's mercurial owner, Luciano Gaucci, who at that time also owned a Serie A, Perugia.
Morace said he had rejected Gaucci's request to fire his assistant and coach on the side. “He let me know that I could continue working with anyone I wanted. But by then, there was a lack of mutual trust and I didn’t like to continue in that climate of uncertainty,” he said. Morace works today as a lawyer in Rome and as an expert football commentator in television and on the pages of the daily Gazzetta dello Sport.
She said: “At the moment, I see too many men, even in the game of women, who are working, despite not having the same experience as women, who, on the contrary, are not working.” Raymond Domenech, former manager of the French national team, said: “Women know how to play football and how to handle it and are good at it. Why shouldn't they lead the men's teams? The opposite happens and does not cause any problems. It is a natural choice and reflects our society in which women are equal to men. I say well done to President Michy. I told myself that if I took over a club again, I'd hire a woman like my number two. He beat me.
A statement on Clermont Foot 63’s website said that Costa’s appointment would allow the club to enter “a new era.” On the club's supporters' website, the reaction to Costa's appointment was a mixture of surprise and a certain cynicism. “In my opinion, it’s just a publicity stunt to make people talk about the club and she won’t last the season. I find it hard to believe that I can get the respect of the players, especially when he is the same age as the older one,” wrote a fan. “Your resume is not bad, but now the question is: will it be good enough?” added another. A third wrote: “I wish her welcome and success, but I think it will be difficult for her to make her brand as a woman in such a macho business. Has our president achieved a coup in the media?”
But Soulier had hopes: “I hope that, with the new manager, the club can find the motivation they lack right now,” he said. “Team kids can be hard to handle. With a woman in charge, they may be less demanding.”
If Costa's reputation is something to go through, she'll be the one to make the demands. After making work experience in Chelsea during the first season of his compatriot José Mourinho as club manager between 2004 and 2007, it was described as “Mourinho with skirt”. Costa quickly contacted the sexist comment. “Like Mourinho, I always want to win. As far as that goes, yes, I am happy to be compared to him,” he said.",B2
"In the United States, people love partying for many reasons. Of course there are regular birthday parties, but some people even have parties to celebrate divorces! No matter what kind of party you're going to, it's a good idea to make sure you're really invited. It is considered rude to appear unless the host, the person who throws the party, invited you. You will receive a newspaper, email or verbal invitation to a party. Alternatively, you can also go as a guest of another guest, such as his appointment. Once invited, it's very important for the host to know if you're really going to show up. Many times the hosts have a attended party, which means that other people prepare the meal. They need to know how much food to eat. Let them know if you are appearing or not helping the host and consider yourself polite.

It is also important to be relatively punctual for a party. Most parties in the United States never start exactly when they say they will. Many people like to be ""fashiony late"", that is, appear about 30 minutes after the party is supposed to start. People like to do this to make a big entrance. Appearing more than 30 minutes before or after is considered rude, however. If you show up too early, you are likely to interrupt the host's valuable preparation time. If you show up too late, you're being rude.
Even if it's not a birthday party, it's polite to bring a present to the host. It doesn't have to be a fancy gift. A bottle of wine, or even flowers, is courteous and will be appreciated.",B2
"Sleep deprivation used to be a badge of honor: a sign that he was busy and important and highly sought after. Snoozing was losing and the dream was for the cowards. Now, however, Arianna Huffington's Sleep Revolution, a ""call to bed"" that promises to transform your life ""one night at a time,"" is a New York Times best-seller, and Huffington is urging people to ""sleep to the top."" Meanwhile, the sleep industry has woken up big and a wide range of start-ups are reinventing where, when and how we sleep, as well as how much we are willing to pay for it. For the most luxurious, luxury hotels offer “sleeping retreats”; over $1,000 give you dinner and a movie about sleep. And, if you stay at home, you can improve your bedroom with everything, from a mattress cover with a sensor that tracks your sleep ($249) to a brain wave monitoring sleep mask that allows you to sleep more efficiently ($299).
The dream has not only been corporate, but has infiltrated the corporations. Several companies already have naps and Huffington predicts that naps in offices will become “as common as conference rooms” in the next two years. So how did this happen? How did they sleep, something humans have done long before Huffington woke up, suddenly got so fashionable?
Having enough sleep is a natural fit for the kind of lifestyle in which to pay $10 for green juice and $34 for a SoulCycle class is the norm. Then, there is the increase in self quantified through usable technology. Our bodies have become input/output devices that we monitor and optimize for greater efficiency and sleep has become another set of data to follow. What Huffington emphasizes about sleep, after all, is not that it rests you, but that it restores you. Sleep, he says, is the ultimate performance enhancer and getting eight hours of rest has become the ultimate status symbol.
Do you know how Arianna Huffington has eight hours? Well, first of all, he has “nine or more” attendees, according to a recent New York Times profile. Huffington calls them “A-Team”; they do everything, from doing their errands to planning their journey to loading the Huffington Post on their computer in the morning. According to the Times, most of team A can only take about 12 months of work because it's so exhausting. Low pay also means that many of them take second jobs. Basically, they don't sleep so Huffington can... and sell books about it.
Sleeping enough isn't just a matter of valuing sleep enough to go to bed at the right time; it's a matter of going to bed in the right neighborhood and in the right body. Numerous studies show that you are more likely to sleep badly if you are poor. It's hard to sleep if you're worried about your safety or haven't had enough to eat. It's hard to sleep if you're one of 15 million American shift workers working irregular hours. The research has also found that there is a white/black sleep gap. One study shows that while white people sleep an average of 6.85 hours, African Americans sleep an average of 6.05 hours. They also have a lower quality of sleep. Researchers have attributed this, in part, to the stress of discrimination.
Do you want to know who sleeps most and what is the best quality of sleep in the United States? Rich white women. Which, if I risk guessing, is probably the same demographic Huffington is pointing to his book. Huffington describes his promotion of sleep as a “revolution” but, in reality, it is a brand change. The real sleep crisis we face is not because a few rich people think it's a waste of time; it's because 99% can't afford to spend time sleeping.
While the dream is currently enjoying a moment, it will probably be short-lived. Sleep can be a performance enhancer, but it is inefficient. The real prize is to find a way to deny sleep deprivation so that humans can function with less sleep. As expected, the military are at the forefront of this investigation. In 2008, the Pentagon published a report called “Human Performance” which examined the possibility of a future in which soldiers could act at their peak with just a couple of hours of sleep. “Suppose a human could be designed to sleep for the same amount of time as a giraffe (9.9 hours per night).
This would result in a decrease of approximately double the rate of casualties. An adversary would need an increase of approximately 40% in the level of troops to compensate for this advantage.” The report goes on to examine the effects of ampaquines, a class of medications that modulate neurotransmitters in the brain, to eliminate the effects of sleep deprivation.
In time, humans will find a way to get rid of sleep. Spending a third of your unconscious life will no longer be a luxury; it will be something only the poor will be forced to do. At that point, we may need a new kind of dream revolution.

"Former Republican Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska has been authorized by the Justice Department's request to dismiss his convictions for federal corruption and drop all charges against him, his lawyer said on Wednesday.
Former Senator Ted Stevens, 85, from Alaska, lost his candidacy for reelection in November.
Prosecutors accused Stevens of not disclosing hundreds of thousands of free dollars from an oil service company on Senate ethics forms. But in December, an unnamed FBI complainant accused prosecutors of withholding evidence from the defense, and the Department of Justice asked a judge to dismiss the charges against Stevens on Wednesday.
His name is clear, Stevenslawyer, Brendan Sullivan, told the reporters. He's innocent of the charges, as if they've never been brought.
Stevens, 85, lost his candidacy for a full seventh term in November after his conviction for seven counts of lying on Senate ethics forms. Sullivan said the Department of Justice was forced to apply for dismissal due to extraordinary evidence of government corruption. See more about the dismissal of the case
Not only did the government not provide evidence to the defense that the law requires them to provide, but they created false testimony that they gave us and actually presented false testimony in the courtroom, he said.
And one of Stevenslongtime's friends, Utah Senator Orrin Hatch, said Wednesday that Stevens was screwed by our own Department of Justice.
In a statement issued Wednesday morning, Stevens thanked the Department of Justice and Attorney General Eric Holder for requesting that the charges be dropped.
“I always knew there would be a day when the cloud around me would be removed,” Stevens said. That day has finally arrived.
The U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan has scheduled a hearing on Tuesday about the Justice Department's request to dismiss the case.
Sullivan, who is not a relative of Stevenslawyer, excommunicated the prosecutors during the trial and kept the prosecution in contempt at any given time. In December, two months after the guilty verdicts, the FBI complainant accused prosecutors of withholding evidence from the defense and reported that someone with the government had had an inappropriate relationship with Bill Allen, an oil industry executive who was the key government witness.
In the motion filed on Wednesday, the Department of Justice acknowledged that Stevens did not have access to the notes taken by prosecutors during an April 2008 interview with Allen, the former president of an oilfield services company at the center of a corruption investigation in Alaska. The notes show that Allen's responses, the prosecution's star witness, were inconsistent with the testimony he gave against Stevens, and that the interview information might have benefited Stevens in the trial, says the motion.
In the light of this conclusion, and taking into account the full circumstances of this particular case, I have determined that it is in the interests of justice to dismiss the indictment and not to proceed with a new trial, Holder said in a written statement.
Hatch, a senior Republican on the Senate Judicial Committee, said he called Stevens in Alaska on Wednesday and the former senator sounded euphoric, like anyone else would.
Here's a guy who gave over 60 years of service to the country and was fucked... fucked by our own Department of Justice, Hatch said. But he praised Holder for standing up and fixing this bad situation.
“I think he is more than proven integrity and decency in this matter, and it is not easy for him to do that,” Hatch said. By looking at it, you've realized that now what people like me have been saying is 100% correct.
Senate majority leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, also commented on the Justice Department's petition, saying Ted Stevens is 85 years old. He's been punished enough. I'm satisfied.
And in a statement Wednesday, the governor of Alaska. Sarah Palin said Stevens deserves to be very happy today. What a horrible thing you've endured. The blatant attempts of adversaries to destroy one's reputation, career and finances are an abuse of our well-protected process and violate our God-given rights in the Constitution.
It is frightening to contemplate what we may be witnessing here: the weakening of the political process through unscrupulous schemes and professional misconduct. Senator Stevens... never lost hope. It is regrettable that, as a result of the questionable procedures that led Senator Stevensconviction days before the election, the Alaskas lost an esteemed statesman in the Capitol. His presence is lost.
The Department of Justice's Office of Professional Responsibility will review the conduct of the prosecution team in Stevenscase, Holder said. Asked if prosecutors should be charged themselves, Sullivan told journalists, “That’s not my job. I'm a defense attorney.
During the trial, Deputy Attorney General Matthew Friedrich said Stevens hid hundreds of thousands of dollars of gifts he received from Allen's company, VECO, and Allen himself. Many of the services allegedly free of charge were provided as part of the renovation of the StevensAlaska house, prosecutors said.
Terry Frieden of CNN, Paul Courson, Ted Barrett and Deb Krajnak contributed to this report.

"That millennials rely heavily on technology is not a secret. More than eight in ten say they sleep with a mobile phone next to their bed, almost two-thirds admit they send text messages while driving, one in five has posted a video of themselves online and three-quarters have created a profile on a social networking site.
Compared to other generations, millennials are the most active on social media, according to a 2010 report, and 75% of them have created at least one social media account. In contrast, only 50% of Generation X, 30% of baby boomers and 6% of those over 65 use social media. But there's a small percentage of millennials who don't use social media at all. Meet the millennials rejecting the trend.
Celan Beausoleil, 31, Oakland, California Beausoleil is a social worker and has had an “on and off, more off than on” relationship with Facebook.
For the last time he deactivated his account in December 2015 after finding the amount of personal information shared by other “too heavy” to deal with his work demands.
“A lot of my job is to listen to people’s lives all day, every day, and it started to feel so overwhelming to go to social media and see every detail of everyone’s life, including people I don’t really have a relationship with,” he said. “It feels almost like an overload of intimacy.” He added: “I am holding a lot in my working life for people and sometimes I felt it was too heavy to do in my personal life as well.”
But Beausoleil loves the way social media connects the world in a truly unique way, citing as one of his only reasons to stay on Facebook as long as he did. “One thing I really liked about Facebook was that I could sit down for hours and click on a friend and then click on one of his friends and one of his friends and one of his friends and literally end up on someone’s Facebook page on the other side of the world,” he said. I used to do that all the time.
“One day, I realized that I’m spending so much time doing this. These seconds add up. I wonder what it would be like if I didn't spend these seconds here and spend them doing something else. What if I was doing other things with these seconds? What would they become? Would you enjoy it?”
Mathias, who works for the Baltimore City government, had Facebook and Twitter accounts for years before they were eliminated in November 2012. But “he quickly forgot that Facebook existed” after his improvised decision to end his presence on social media. You can still appreciate the benefits of having accounts on social media, like when you first met your girlfriend’s friends and realized that “humanizing 20 people you’re going to meet at a party” is much easier if you can connect their faces, their places of origin and their jobs with a photo later. Or how easy it is to organize big events online. Mathias is based on friends for the party invitations and is sure that there are times that he “slides through the cracks.”
But, now, he enjoys the time he's free. He spends his trips by lift and his moments of rest at work reading news articles and books instead of travelling through a news source. And without having friends to stay online, he has to “pick up the phone and call them,” something that has come to “definitely enjoy.”
Lauren Raskauskas, 22, Naples, Florida Raskauskas describes herself as a “pretty private” person. So social media, which can open you up to scrutiny and analysis of others, is not so attractive to her. “I am more reserved and have concerns about giving my data,” said Raskauskas, who is currently looking for a job.
He recently deleted his Twitter account and deactivated his Facebook account two years ago after realizing that “he didn’t like everyone knowing what he was doing.” But Raskauskas, who came late to the Facebook game because his “parents were very strict with technology,” can see the positive aspects of social media. When a friend of hers who had lost track of moving to Naples for a month, Raskauskas did not even realize that she was there until after she had left, that the 22-year-old said it was “a nuisance.”
But in the end, his privacy concerns overcame any benefits social media could provide and he saw a clear advantage when he went through a recent breakup. The last time a relationship of hers ended and she was online, it wasn't nice.
“Once, I broke up with someone while I was on Facebook and I was like ‘Oh, my God, should I change my profile picture? Should I change my state?’ And, this time, I don’t have to worry about any of that because that kind of thing is pretty hard,” he said.
Rajagopalan, a Boston College student, sees no inconvenience in abstaining from social media.
He states that “he has not seen any effect at this time”. Even though classmates post about parties and events on Facebook, they make sure to send you a text message, too, he said. “Since I was young, I was always a step back in that kind of thing, so I never cared,” he said.
In fact, the only time Rajagopalan made use of social media was when it was inevitable: it was the only way to reach his new roommate in college. Before starting her first year at college, she enrolled for her first, and unique, social media account. He joined Facebook to get in touch with his future roommate and talk about his plans for that year.
Months later, he still has the bill, but admits: “I don’t use it. I don’t check it or anything like that.” The biggest activity you see is when your two sisters tag you in family photos. He has avoided social media accounts in all other situations, although he has felt the appeal of Twitter. As a sports fan, he acknowledged that “that’s where most of the news comes out.” But he refused to get an account, saying, “I really don’t need one to read tweets.”

"If you have a low income, are old, or are disabled, there are a number of public housing options in the United States. Public housing options are handled by federal, state and municipal government agencies. Living in public housing is often called ""living in projects"", but this is a negative term based on stereotypes. Not all public housing options mean living in huge and degraded buildings with a lot of crime.

Public housing programs come in all sizes and types. A guy's a single-family house. Another type includes living in a high-rise building, or apartments in tall buildings. All public housing options are rental options, which means that you do not own the place where you live.
The right to public housing is based on a number of factors. One factor is your annual gross income, that is, how much money you make in a year. Another factor is whether you are elderly or have a disability. Another factor that is taken into account is your U.S. citizenship or eligible immigration status. Most public housing options are only available to U.S. citizens or legal residents of the United States. As with any rental, your references are checked to ensure that you and your family will be good tenants. This means looking at your credit history and your criminal record. People with a criminal record are generally prohibited or unable to use public housing options.
To find out if you are eligible for public housing, you need to visit a government housing support office near you. You can find your local home help office by checking the yellow pages or by looking online. You will have to fill out an application. In the application you will have to list the names, sex and date of birth of all people who would live in the house or apartment.",B2

John is a busy lawyer, whose whole day revolves around two things: work and his two daughters. Balancing the two often turns out to be very difficult, so John spends most of his day in a hurry to do everything he has to do, and get to wherever he needs to be. With such a hectic schedule, it is common to find John and his children in line at a McDonald's drive-thru, waiting for some burgers, fries and smoothies.

""I know fast food is not the healthiest thing I can give to my daughters,"" admits John. ""But it's most convenient when we're in a hurry. Besides, it makes them happy."" Unfortunately, this attitude toward the unhealthyness of fast food is an attitude that so many parents in the United States maintain, and it is easy to understand why.
Today, almost every city in America is equipped with its own McDonald's. Only in L.A., sometimes you can feel like there's one in every other corner when you drive around. As if this didn't make it difficult enough for parents to avoid it, McDonald's directs his famous ""Happy Foods"" to the children so that every time they drive through the giant golden arches, the children demand to enter to get a new toy with their food.
Although it can be very difficult for parents to have healthier food options for their children, doing so is a need that this country can no longer ignore. The constant consumption of fast food is becoming a norm in American society and is leading to millions of people suffering from obesity and diabetes for the rest of their lives. Instead of teaching children that it is OK to give in to the temptation of a fast, greasy meal, parents should lead their children into the habit of eating healthy wherever they go. In the end, children will be more grateful for living a long, healthy and happy life than for getting a cheap toy in a cardboard box.",B2
"In the United States, the baby boomer generation includes those born in the time after World War II. Those babies are reaching retirement age. As these adults age, many of their adult children worry about how they will take care of their aged parents. In the United States, it is not common for several generations to live under one roof. Once the children grow up and marry, they move, leaving their elderly parents to fend for themselves. When these aged parents are no longer able to take care of themselves because of their age or illness, it is not uncommon for adult children in the United States to place their elderly parents in a nursing home.

A nursing home is a centre that offers care to the elderly and sick 24 hours a day. As the name suggests, nursing homes have medical nurses, doctors, social workers, and therapists to help older adults cope with the challenges of everyday life. Most nursing homes also have social activities for older persons to participate and stay active. These activities range from games to dance classes and movie nights. The nursing homes are supposed to provide three nutritious meals to their residents.
However, nursing homes are controversial. There have been cases across the country of officials in nursing homes abusing and even stealing from resident elders. There are different states and federal agencies that are supposed to oversee the facilities of nursing homes. Some people believe that it should be the responsibility of family members, especially adult children, to care for their elderly or sick parents. However, many adult children have their own children and families to care for, and do not have the means to care for their elderly parents; others worry about the medical skills needed if their elderly parents are seriously ill.",B2
"LRB-CNN-RRB- I am Candida Moss and am a professor of New Testament and Early Christianity at Notre Dame University. I was an advisor to the True Cross episode and served as one of the many camera experts in the CNN Finding Jesus series, which is currently broadcast on Sundays.
Viewers were invited to tweet and post their questions on the Facebook page Finding Jesus during the show. Below are some of the most interesting questions and my answers to them. My apologies to everyone I didn't reach. Feel free to tweet your questions directly to me.
Herb Scribner: Can anyone explain to me what the Bible deals with 40 days/nights?
Moss: It's more of an interest in number 40. In the Hebrew Bible the people of Israel roam the desert for 40 years before reaching the Holy Land. The flood lasts 40 days and nights; Moses spends 40 days and nights on the mountain; Goliath spends 40 days encouraging the Israelites to challenge him before David rises; 40 is a common age for the people when they marry; in the book of Judges there are always 40 years among the judges; and David and Solomon each reigned 40 years. What we can take away from all of this is that people in the ancient world saw 40 as suggesting a full-time and full-time period. It's like a number of narrative actions, in the way that modern jokes follow the rule of three.
Yalanda M. Price: Was there any division between the followers of Jesus and the followers of John the Baptist?
Moss: One of the interesting things about the relationship between Jesus and John the Baptist is that John does not put in his tools and follows Jesus after baptizing him. Apparently, neither did John’s disciples. They had separate ministries and, although there might have been contact between the two groups, they were also de facto competitors in the former religious market. There are some indications in the New Testament that Jesus and his followers had to differentiate themselves from John by claiming that Jesus' baptism was better—LRB-Acts 11:6—RRB—and by counteracting the idea that Jesus was really John risen from the dead—LRB-Matthew 14:2—RRB- Some scholars argue that these references are evidence of tension between Jesus' followers and John's followers.
Mark Goodacre answers your questions about the Shroud of Turin.
Jeffery Graff: Can DNA tests on the bones indicate whether he is Jewish or even from the tribe of Levi?
I'm glad someone got DNA. DNA tests on Bulgarian bones produced only mitochondrial DNA - LRB- DNA transmitted by the mother -RRB-, not the most reliable nuclear DNA - LRB- the type of DNA mentioned in forensic investigations -RRB-. In the original study of Bulgarian relics - LRB- of which it was a part -RRB-, mitochondrial DNA revealed that Bulgarian relics were of probable Semitic origin. Thinking about my time in the lab with the scientists in Copenhagen, I remember that the lead investigator estimated the probability to be around 75%. Last night's episode said things a little abruptly when it said the bones were from a Middle Eastern man.
As for the more specific question about the genetics of Jews and members of Levi's tribe: Current scientific technology does not reveal this type of information, even if start-up genetic testing companies promise this type of information.
Cyndi Rosenthal: Is there any other historical reference of John the Baptist outside the Bible?
Daniel José Camacho: Any extra-biblical fountain that sheds light on the historical figure of John the Baptist?
Moss: -LRB- These questions are on a similar subject, so I have chosen to answer them together. -RRB- Actually there is an external testimony for the life and importance of John the Baptist. This is important because it is quite rare to find this kind of evidence for ancient figures outside the writings of their followers. The Jewish historian Josephus mentions John the Baptist in his book, The Jewish Antiquities. Josephus describes John as a good man who possessed virtue and had great influence on the people. According to Josephus, Herod killed John the Baptist because he was afraid to raise a rebellion. This gives us another -- possibly more historical -- perspective on why John was executed and provides more evidence about how important John was in his own day.

Daniel José Camacho: Wait, how did Jesus get our Father's prayer from Johnny B??? I didn't get it.
Moss: I am also very happy that someone brought this up, because I was also wondering about it. In the Gospel of Luke, one of Jesus' disciples says: Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples. It is an interesting request that tells us something about the ministry of John the Baptist and the demanding characters of Jesus disciples! In Luke, Jesus responds to this request by teaching them the Lord's prayer. We don't know that the Lord's prayer came from John, and I personally don't think he did it; I think that's how Luke formed his version of events. But if you were reading Luke you could come to that conclusion.

"Brazilian public notary Claudia do Nascimento Domingues started a storm of fire by granting the first Brazilian civil union a trio, an act so unprecedented that there is no word for it in Portuguese.
Uniao polyafetiva is the label she created. The polyfidelite bond is your best guess in English.
The relationship involves three professionals in their 30s -- a man and two women -- who, he says, live together, love each other as equals and are like any other couple who is not married, except that they are three.
What Domingues did was legally register the trio as a stable union, a civil union that extends all the benefits of marriage, although there is debate about the rights that the trio will actually enjoy. In short, it recognizes the trio as a family entity for public legal purposes.
Domingues has not released the identities of the three.
But not everyone is embracing the unique alliance.
This union is null and void of all legality, said Regina Beatriz Tavares da Silva, head of the family law committee of a law association in Sao Paulo.
Brazilian law defines marriage as a union between two persons, so it is impossible for a three-person civil union to have the rights of a two-person marriage.
It goes directly against the Constitution, said da Silva. Monogamy is defined as the relationships between two, not between three or four or five.
The first of its kind civil union has led to a protest by religious groups, too. Those who fear the slope of the shoe feel the ground moving under their feet.
The institution of the family cannot be defended with the approval of actions that seek to distort its definition, said in a statement the religious and conservative Instituto Plinio Correa de Oliveira. The purpose of this - LRB- union -RRB- is not to build families, but to destroy them.
The controversial civil union is proof that there is a plurality of family relations, although not all deserve a judicial or legal position, said Rolf Madaleno, director of the Brazilian Institute of Family Law, in a statement. The action carried out does not provide protections and does not confer rights.
In his view, the legal action in question merely reaffirms that the trio in question believes that they are a trio.
Domingues, 39, argues that they deserve some benefits. They live together in Rio de Janeiro, share a bank account and want protection in case of separation or death, he said.
Brazil is known for its progressive social policies and openness, as reflected in the status granted to the trio, although the country is also stereotyped. Although Brazil seems to be a permissive place, it is also a country where more than 86% of the population identifies as Catholic or evangelical.
There was a similar protest when stable same-sex unions were allowed for the first time. The country's Supreme Court ruled that a gay couple in a civil union had the same rights as a married heterosexual couple, but there is debate as to whether those rights can be extended to a trio.
But for Domingues, a notary public of the city of Tupa in the state of Sao Paulo, nothing prevents non-traditional relations from receiving a stable union status.
The trio is considered a family and has the right to be seen as such in the public register, Domingues said.
By registering them, I only confirmed that they recognize themselves as a family, he said. I don't grant them rights. That's up to a judge to decide.
The civil union was granted three months ago, but the news spread this week.
Da Silva called the civil union deceitful, an escape to grant status to a polygamous relationship.
Such relationships are not new; they have simply not been recognized, Domingues said.
She says she simply put her approval stamp on a relationship she was surfing in a wave of cultural currents, but it was no accident that the application landed on her desk.
The Rio trio, rejected by other public notaries, found its way in the rural state of Sao Paulo and Domingues because it is a student of polyfidelite relations - some involving more than two partners, but where there is fidelity among members.
Previously IT manager, Domingues is now a PhD student at the University of Sao Paulo, studying family law.
His dissertation, he said, is about how you can love more than one person at the same time. His research analyzes cultures, places, sociology, anthropology, religion and the history of family and intimate relations in Brazil.
Through mutual friends, the trio found Domingues and traveled more than 600 miles from Rio, to the interior of the state of Sao Paulo, to Tupa.
Domingues does not hesitate to call herself married, although she and her husband are united by a stable union and not a civil marriage. Her husband works with her as an assistant public notary.
We've had all the reactions you can imagine, he said.
Other polyfidelite groups have contacted her in search of the same status as a civil union.
Domingues is studying the cases of one quintet - LRB- two men and three women -RRB- and another threesome -LRB- one woman and two men -RRB-.

"Prince Harry has flown out of Afghanistan at the end of a four-month tour, during which he admitted to killing insurgents while driving his Apache helicopter and spoke in depth about the tensions and frustrations of being a king who longed for life outside the spotlight.
He also revealed his disdain and distrust towards some sections of the media and described how his father constantly reminded him to behave more like a member of the royal family.
Commander of the army's most sophisticated attack helicopter, the prince said he had fired on the Taliban during operations to support ground troops and rescue wounded Afghan and NATO personnel. His comments may be taken advantage of by the insurgents to awaken anti-British sentiment, but the prince said he was only doing his job. Most of the time the helicopter acted more as a deterrent, he said.
In a series of interviews during his stay in Camp Bastion in Helmand province, he hinted at the difficulty of reconciling the different roles of his life. The prince, known as Captain Wales in the army, explained his 'three months'. “One in the army, one socially in my private time and then one with the family and stuff. So there is a switch and I press it when necessary.”
He admitted that he sometimes ""let himself fall"" with his Laddish behavior, which justified ""probably being too army and not enough prince,"" but said he had the right to privacy, too.
In another unusually frank exchange, he addressed biting criticisms to the media, especially the Sun, the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph, three of the most ardent supporters of the royal family on Fleet Street. He said he was particularly upset about the items comparing his role as an Apache co-driver with Spitfire's teams that were hoping to roll over during World War II. “No, it’s not like that at all,” he said.
The prince said that his suspicion of the media was rooted in the treatment of his family when he was “very small,” but that he could not stop monitoring the stories written about him. “Of course I read them,” the prince said. “If there is a story and something has been written about me, I want to know what is being said. But all he does is bother me and get angry because people can get away with writing the things they do; not just about me, but about everything and everyone. My father always says, 'Don't read it.' Everybody says, ""Don't read it, because it's always garbage.""
The prince was sent to Afghanistan last September to command an Apache £45 million helicopter, one of the army's most sophisticated and well-armed aircraft. During their tour, Apaches flew support missions to NATO troops fighting the Taliban and accompanied British Chinook and American Black Hawk medical helicopters during casualty evacuations.
Four years ago, the prince had to be expelled from Afghanistan during his first tour after an Australian magazine mistakenly broke an embargo on the media. This time, the Ministry of Defence decided to publicize its deployment on the understanding that newspapers and broadcasters would not comment on its life out there to allow it to move on with its work. Two BBC teams, Sky and ITN, were sent once each to report on their visit, while a photographer and a reporter from the Press Association were incorporated into the three visits.
When asked if he felt more comfortable being Captain Wales than Prince Harry, his answer was one of the most revealing he has given about his relationship with Prince Charles. “Definitely. I've always been like this. My dad's always trying to remind me who I am and stuff like that. But it's very easy to forget who I am when I'm in the army. They all wear the same uniform and do the same kind of thing. I get along with the kids and I enjoy my job. It’s really as simple as that.”
Shortly before going to Afghanistan, the prince was caught in another media rage, when photos of him spun around naked in Las Vegas during a private party. Harry said he was disappointed, but he also blamed the media. “I probably got disappointed, disappointed my family, disappointed other people. But, at the end of the day, I was in a private area and there should be a certain amount of privacy that one should expect. It was probably a classic example that I was too much army, and not enough prince. It's a simple case of that.
“The newspapers knew I was going to go out to Afghanistan anyway, so the way I was treated I don’t think it’s acceptable.” He added, “Certain people remind me: ‘Remember who you are, so don’t always let your guard down.’”
Asked where he and his brother came from, he said: “Probably the fact that you can only fit a certain number of people in a helicopter, so no one can follow us, like you.”

"Hi Samia,
Just a quick email to say it sounds like a great idea. Saturday is better for me because I'm meeting my parents on Sunday. So if that's still good for you, why don't you come here? Then you can see the new flat and all the work we've done in the kitchen since we moved in. We can eat at home and go for an afternoon walk. It's gonna be so good to finally catch up. I want to hear all about your new job!
Our address is 52 Charles Road, but it's a little hard to find because the house numbers are really weird here. If you turn left in the post office and you keep going through the big white house on Charles Road, there's a small side street behind it with houses 50 to 56 inches. Don't ask me why the side street doesn't have a different name! But call me if you get lost and I'll come get you.
Let me know if there's anything you don't like to eat. I'm really looking forward to seeing you!
See you soon!

"I had the most wonderful childhood. I grew up in San Diego, where it rains about two days a year, and it's always sunny and bright. He could ride a bike almost any day of the year, and he had many friends. My best friend was George Kenny. George lived in a few houses on my block and we were the same age. Actually, I was about 28 days older than him, a fact I always threw in his face. ""You must respect your elders,"" he said sometimes. That usually received an unpleasant response from him. Anyway, George came up to me one day and said, ""Hey, Richard, why don't we set up a bike club?""

I thought about it for a while, and then he said, ""We could give ourselves a great name and get hats and stickers and have a lot of fun. What do you say?"" I immediately fell in love with the idea. ""Of course, Georgie Porgy!"" I used to call him that all the time even though I knew I hated him. Well, before we knew it, we had a couple of other guys together and we came up with the best name for a club. We were the White Skulls. Why we chose that name, I'll never know, but all the kids seemed to like it, so I agreed, too.
The four of us went to the local bike shop and each chose a skull sticker to put on our bikes. I chose a green one, while Georgie Porgy chose red. He shouted, ""I am the red skull! I'm the king of the club! If you don't like it, try to take it off!"" George was a pretty big guy, so no one argued with him. We rode our bikes everywhere and had a great summer. That's how we formed the best motorcycle club ever!",A2

Well done, Javier, in all your hard work this term. You're always active in talking activities, and this is great. I always like to read your writing too; you have very good ideas. You can see on your marks that reading is not a problem for you.
Sometimes you keep making little grammatical mistakes, and I think you can improve your vocabulary. I recommend that you review many of the language points that we study this term. There is additional language practice in your online workbook.
The area you most need to work on is listening. I know this is hard for you. I recommend more practice at home. Listen to TV shows, podcasts and radio in English as much as possible. I can give you a list of things to listen to.
I enjoyed working with you. Have a good vacation, and good luck for the next quarter!

"Winter was coming. Jason was excited about next season. It was his favorite time of a year. He loved cold and snow. Jason lived in New York. During the winter it snowed in New York. He always played in the snow, even as an adult. Jason gathered his family and friends in the park, where they had snowball fights. It was so much fun.

His favorite Christmas happened in winter. This was another reason why winter was Jason's favorite season. Every year, he buys gifts for his friends and family. Jason loved to see the look on their faces as they unwrapped their Christmas presents. It was better to give than to receive, Jason thought. Jason loved everything about Christmas. He liked caroling. He loved singing Christmas music. He loved kissing his wife under mistletoe. He loved to drink sweet eggnog. Jason sometimes even dressed like Santa for fun, and entertained his nephews.
Winter also came at the end of a year. New Year's Day would come after Christmas. Jason loved this vacation too. It was a day to celebrate next year, as I reflected on the past. Jason always made New Year's resolutions. Every year he made a new resolution. This year he promised to go skydiving. Last year, he promised himself to lose twenty pounds. Jason always kept his New Year's resolution. He lost 20 pounds in three months. This year was no exception. He planned to enroll in skydiving classes in January next year.
Jason couldn't stop thinking about winter. I couldn't wait for him to arrive. It was going to be the best winter so far. Jason needed to wait five more months because it was barely mid-July.",A2

"Brian Nelson got his first skateboard when he was 9. He started skating right away. He had friends at school who knew how to skate, so he went home after school. Over time, Brian improved and improved in skating. He could do a lot of tricks on his skateboard, but what Brian loved was jumping down the stairs with his skateboard. His record was 15 stairs, but he wanted to beat that record. Brian and his friends went to Hollywood 18, where many skaters are going to make videos of skating.

Brian knew that if he jumped those stairs, he'd become a legend with his friends. As he climbed the stairs, he began counting each ladder one by one. I wanted to make sure the 15. In his first attempt, Brian jumped off his skateboard and landed on the grass by the stairs. I wanted to try again, but I was scared. He finally had the courage to try again. This time he jumped on some stairs. Unfortunately, he didn't pass step 16 on the ladder. He fell off the board, but he didn't get hurt that much. Some girls were looking at Brian, and they asked him if he could do it again. Brian knew he had to get it this time.
While Brian was preparing for his jump, he kept looking at the girls who had gathered to see him. I was breathing a lot, but I knew I could do it. The time had come. Brian was ready to try again. He pushed the pavement, and started pedaling his skateboard faster and faster. He reached the top of the stairs and then jumped. Brian was in the air for about five seconds and then landed. All the girls applauded, and then Brian stopped his skateboard. I had. He broke his record. All the girls went up to give her a hug, but they all stayed away because she smelled. He started laughing. Everyone laughed and congratulated Brian.

"Kim was a housekeeper for a family in Beverly Hills. One morning, when he went to work, he found a note from his boss. The note asked him to go to the supermarket and pick up some things. There was a list of things Kim was supposed to buy. The note surprised Kim. She had only been a housekeeper for a week and had never been asked to go shopping before. Kim didn't even know where the nearest grocery store was. I didn't know how to drive either. Fortunately, the note also told her that the boss' driver would take her to the market. There was also a $50 bill.

Once at the market Kim walked around looking for the items on his list. But I was confused. The list said ""a pound of apples."" Kim had bought a kilogram of apples but never a pound. In their country, they used the metric system. I wasn't sure if a pound was about a kilogram. Kim decided to ask one of the supermarket workers. The grocery store worker was kind and explained that a pound was about half a kilogram.
""However, I wouldn't worry about that. Just use the scale,"" the grocery store worker. Kim went to the scale and was happy to see that the scales didn't use the metric system she was used to. Kim weighed a pound of apples and put it in the shopping cart.
The next item on the list was a gallon of milk. Kim wasn't sure how much a gallon cost. I was used to buying a liter of milk. There was also no way to weigh a liter of milk. He was glad that milk containers were labelled. I wanted the U.S. They'll use the metric system.",A2
"Johnny enjoyed walking around with his long black hair. He also enjoyed the attention given to him by strangers and friends. Walking down the street was never the same after he started doing it with long hair. Johnny never wanted to cut his hair again. I couldn't think of a good reason to do it. All this would change with a conversation on a Saturday morning while he was having breakfast with his parents.

It looked like any other Saturday morning at Johnny's. Mom was cooking pancakes; Dad was reading the paper; Johnny was waiting, sitting at the table drinking orange juice. ""Johnny, it's time for you to get a job,"" Johnny's father suddenly said, without warning. Johnny almost spits out his orange juice after hearing his father's surprising comment. ""What?"" Johnny said after he swallowed.
""There comes a time in every boy's life when he must finally cut his hair and get a job,"" Johnny's father told him. ""But, Dad!"" Johnny said, trying to reason. ""No buts,"" Johnny's father broke. That afternoon Johnny's parents took him to a hairdresser to cut his hair. He did everything he could to contain his tears on the way to the hairdresser.
Johnny sat reluctantly in the barber's chair with a frown on his face. ""Why that long face?"" He asked the barber. ""She doesn't want her hair cut,"" Johnny's mom answered. ""It's just hair. Someday it will grow back,"" the barber said, trying to cheer him up.
The following week, Johnny was hired at McDonald's. His hair was short and clean.",A2

"It's always been a dream of mine to visit New York. My parents always talked about going to New York, but we never went. I loved a lot of things in New York, but one thing I really wanted to see was the Statue of Liberty. My parents aren't from the United States, but I was born here. They saw the Statue of Liberty as something else, not something that people wanted to see and take pictures of.

My parents never saw the Statue of Liberty because we lived in Texas. They crossed the border, and longed to see the Statue of Liberty with their own eyes, but never had the opportunity. I decided he was going to fulfill his dream. Finally I saved enough money for a plane ticket, and I went to stay with a friend I had met at home, but now in New York. We talked on the Internet, and he told me that if I ever had a chance to go to New York, I could stay with her. I called her the day I got my plane ticket.
""Guess who's going to New York,"" I said. He started screaming and saying it was going to be so much fun. I told him my first stop had to be the Statue of Liberty. He told me it couldn't wait. When I got off the plane, I couldn't believe how cold I was. I got my luggage and met my friend outside the airport. I hugged her and we have a cab to take us home.
When we got home, he showed me his room and told me we were going to the Statue of Liberty in an hour. I took a shower and put on two sweaters. We took a cab and went to see the Statue of Liberty. It took a while, but we finally got to the island. I couldn't believe the Statue of Liberty was right in front of my eyes. I started crying, and I felt like my parents were here with me. I always felt like a foreigner in this country even though I was born here. Now I understood why they wanted to visit the Statue of Liberty so much.",A2
"Mike was having a beer in the living room one night while watching a football game. His five-year-old son Rob was playing with Legos on the floor. ""Dad, I bet I can make one of these Legos disappear,"" Rob told his father. Mike was only half of paying attention to his son as his favorite team was playing. ""Uh huh,"" Mike replied distractedly. ""Tada! I made him disappear!"" Rob said proudly. Mike asked his son what his secret was. ""A magician never says so,"" Rob said while hitting his nose. Mike shrugged. ""Guess what, Dad. Guess what!"" Rob encouraged.

Mike thought the Lego was in his son's pocket. He was wrong. Then Mike guessed the Lego was in his son's sock. That was also a wrong assumption. Mike gave up. ""It's in my nose, Dad!"" Rob proudly declared it. Mike spit out his beer and rushed to look at his son's nose. I couldn't see anything up there. He went to the trash drawer in the kitchen and pulled out a little flashlight. Mike looked at his son's nose again. I still couldn't see the bright yellow Lego piece. ""Are you sure he's up there?"" Mike asked his son. Rob nodded. ""Does it hurt?"" Mike asked. Rob shook his head.
Mike didn't want to put anything in his son's nose to try to pull out the mini brick toy. He was afraid to push the Lego up and hurt his son. ""I guess we have to go to the hospital,"" Mike told his son. Rob seemed scared. It was a short trip to the hospital's emergency room.

"My best friend's name is Joseph Taylor, but he prefers to be called Joe. He does a lot of stupid things, and he usually gets into trouble. The other day, while trying to impress some girls, he fell off his skateboard and broke his arm. Joe had to put his arm in a cast, but he told me it was worth it. I had already received three phone numbers from the girls I was trying to impress.

I always love Joe coming to my house, because it makes my day more exciting. After showing me his arm, Joe asked me if I wanted to go to the mall. ""Sure, why not?"" I said. I asked my mother's permission, and she said yes.
When we got to the mall, Joe wanted to eat something, so we went to McDonald's. We got two burgers and two sodas, and then we walked down the mall. For some reason, Joe always liked to steal stuff from the mall stores. I never understood why he stole the things he did. For example, that day he stole three key rings, five pairs of socks and a T-shirt from a television show he had never heard of. Joe always said the same thing when he left the store, ""I love the rush to steal!"" I always looked at him, shook my head and called him an idiot.
The worst was yet to come. When we got out of the mall to get the bus, a security guard grabbed Joe and me and told us we couldn't leave. The security guard took us to his office, and he called our parents. I was worried because I knew my father would yell at me. Joe, on the other hand, would laugh and tell me jokes. When our parents showed up to pick us up, Joe looked at me, smiling, and said, ""See you in a couple of months."" I looked at him, shook my head and called him an idiot.",A2

"Richard grew up in Los Angeles, California, and had a pretty good life. There was food on the table and I had a lot of clothes to wear. I didn't really have any need. He went to a good school in a nice area of the city, and had many friends. Richard grew up with three older sisters, who also enjoyed his life in California, and had many friends. All this was possible because of his father Michael.

Michael was born in poverty in a small town outside Mexico City. When Michael was a child, he remembered times when there was not enough food to eat, or fresh water to drink. Every time I was thirsty, I went to the river to collect water. Michael lived in a shack that had no floor. Many times he slept on the ground, with only one blanket between him and the ground.
All that changed when, at the age of 17, Michael emigrated to the United States with his family. The early years were almost as difficult as in Mexico, but gradually things began to get better for Michael and his family.
When Michael turned 19, he decided to enroll in a community college. His father had always stressed the importance of learning English while living in Mexico. That talent was very useful to Michael now. Soon Michael was bringing excellent notes home. Because of this, he was able to transfer to a university and obtained his degree in engineering.
Michael got a great job that paid well, which allowed him to move to a better part of the city, and also help his parents. He soon had a family of his own. When Richard was born, it was the happiest day of Michael's life.",A2
"It was the first week of June. Gabi just finished his third year of high school at El Sereno. However, when he received his report card in the mail, he learned that he failed a semester of algebra. This meant I had to go to summer school.

Gabi was glad she had a chance to do the class. You can't go to the next level in math if you don't approve of algebra. Summer school isn't easy. Gabi has to master the material in 6 weeks instead of the 20 he had during the regular school year.
Summer school also meant that Gabi would be trapped in a hot classroom while most of her friends were on the beach or in local amusement parks. His friends passed algebra, so they had most of June, July and August free of school work. Going to summer school also meant that Gabi's family had to change their summer vacation plans.
Gabi had to be in summer school from 9 a.m. to noon. He couldn't stay late at night or sleep at home. I had to be on the bus at least an hour before class started or if I wasn't late. The classrooms were hot as the school building was old and had no air conditioning. When Gabi came back from school, he couldn't do what he wanted. After Gabi took the bus home from school, she had homework to do.
This was the first time Gabi had to go to summer school. I wanted it to be the last time. Gabi made a promise. In the fall, when regular classes begin again, she will try her best to pass. Sweating in a classroom while your friends are out having fun isn't funny. Summer holidays aren't so much a break when you have school.",A2

Learning to drive seemed scary to Joel at first. Recently he had bought his first car, which was now sitting at his entrance, looking clean and bright. The previous owner had kept it for years and had spent a lot of money restoring it to its original condition. The car was a BMW, manufactured in 1984. It was black and had only two doors. The interior was also black and had leather seats. The vehicle seemed practically new to Joel, despite being older than the new owner.

Joel was anxious to start driving his new car. At 21, Joel had already felt the need to drive. I was attending college in the city of Los Angeles, working at a bookstore in the city of Montebello, and living in the city of Bell. Having a car would make traveling much more convenient. Joel had been running around by public transport. I was ready to stop taking the bus to school and work.
The first thing Joel had to do was go to DMV to search the car in his name. After that, he took a DMV driving manual to study for the written test. Passing the written test was the only way to get a driver's license. Joel studied for a few days, and passed his test. With permission in hand, Joel had to find someone to teach him how to drive.
Joel already knew who to ask for driving lessons. ""If I'm going to teach you how to drive, you're going to have to commit 100%. Do you understand?"" Joel's uncle asked him. 'Yes, sir,' replied Joel. After a month full of tests and mistakes, Joel finally learned to drive his car. Although it was scary at first, driving eventually became easy enough for Joel.",A2

"Anthony was in senior high school and had a car. Even though Anthony wasn't 21 years old, which is the legal age to buy alcohol, he occasionally had a drink with his friends. Anthony was excited, because today was his graduation day. He was wearing his tuxedo, and he had a flower for his date. He got in his car and went to pick up his friend Jacob, and then pick up Jennifer, his date.

When they got to the dance, Jacob and Jennifer's date went to the bathroom. Jacob pulled a small bottle of whiskey out of his jacket pocket and told Anthony to have a drink. Anthony took some and didn't like it, but he was still drinking. As Anthony and Jennifer danced, he began to feel dizzy. He was drunk. ""Anthony, are you okay?"" Jennifer asked. Anthony looked at her and laughed. He realized he was drunk, and decided to leave with Jacob's appointment.
Anthony got angry and decided to leave. He got in his car and left. While driving down Mentel Avenue, he saw a police car following him. He got nervous and started chewing gum. Anthony was looking at the police car through his mirror so much that he almost took a red light. When the police saw this, they stopped Anthony.
The police did some tests to see if he had been drinking, and Anthony failed them. The police took him. His father picked him up and went to talk to a lawyer. The lawyer said Anthony would have to take alcohol education classes, go to Alcoholics Anonymous, do community service, and pay a fine. Anthony's father said Anthony would have to get a job too to pay the fine. Anthony decided never to drink after that. He said it wasn't worth it.",A2

"It was the beginning of summer. David Lopez' father wanted me to get a summer job. David had just finished school and was looking forward to enjoying his free time. He wanted to sleep late, he wanted to play video games, and he wanted to spend time with his friends. David's father decided he'd get a job for David. When he got home, he handed David a uniform for Burger Hut. David was sad because he didn't want to work at Burger Hut. He knew all his friends were going there, and he knew his friends would make fun of him. David knew that his father was able to get him this job because the owner was his father's friend. The owner's name is Michael. David didn't like it that much.

David had the first day at work. Everyone who worked at Burger Hut had to wear a hat. David's hat fell into the oil where they made the fries. Michael had to take it out with a big spoon. After spending a week, David seemed to get used to working at Burger Hut. Michael was impressed by how hard David worked, and told him he could take a day off.
During his day off, David went out with his friends. They went to the park and played some basketball, and then their friends decided to go get something to eat. David asked them where they wanted to go. They said they wanted to go eat at Burger Hut. David tried to convince them to go somewhere else, but his friends really wanted to go to Burger Hut.
When they arrived at Burger Hut, David put on his sweater and hat. He sat on the corner of the restaurant and tried to hide from his co-workers and his boss. When his friends got their food, they sat down with David. Michael went out and saw David. He came up to him and said, ""You can't have enough of this place, can you, David?"" Michael laughed and then left. David's friends bit his burgers, and they looked at David. ""Do you work here?"" One of David's friends asked. His other friend looked at him and said, ""Can you get me a job?"" David smiled and, nervously, said, ""I'll try.""",A2
"Hello, Lucia.
How are you? It was nice meeting you last week in Sydney at the sales meeting. How was the rest of your trip? Have you seen kangaroos? I hope you made it to Mexico City.
Anyway, I have the documents about the new offices in Berlin. We'll be open in three months. I moved here from London last week. They are very nice offices, and the location is perfect. There are many restaurants, cafes and banks in the area. There is also public transport; we are next to a U-Bahn (that is the name of the metro here). Maybe you can come and see them sometime? I'd love to show you Berlin, especially in winter. You said you've never seen snow – you'll see a lot here!
Here's a picture of you and me at Sydney's restaurant. It was a fun night! Remember the English singer? Crazy! Please send me any other pictures you have from that night. Good memories.
Please give me your email address and I'll send you the documents.
Goodbye for now.

"The Empire State Building can be the most famous building in New York City. It's called Empire State Building because the state of New York is called Empire State. It's 1,454 feet tall. A lot of people think it's the tallest building in the world. This was true when it was built in 1931. In 1970, when the World Trade Center was built, it became the tallest building. Now, the Empire State Building is the fourth tallest building in the United States and the 23rd tallest in the world. Inside the building is occupied mostly by offices and shops.

People can go to the top of the building, where there is an observation deck. From the top there are beautiful views of New York City, especially at night. Most people take one of the 73 lifts to the top. It takes less than a minute by elevator to get to the 80th floor. That's where there's a gift shop. Some people walk 1,860 steps to the top. Every year there is even a race, with people competing to see who can climb the top faster.
The reference point is not only famous because of its height. In 1945, a small plane crashed into him. More than 30 people have attempted suicide by jumping out of the building. In 1933 he appeared in the film King Kong, where a giant gorilla climbs to the top and falls to his death after being attacked by planes. The building was also in the film Sleepless in Seattle with Tom Hanks.
At night, the top of the Empire State Building is illuminated in different colors. It's red and green at Christmas, red for Lunar New Year, and blue for Hanukkah. July 4th is red, white and blue.",A2

"The night was quiet in Los Angeles, although the wind was particularly cold. Frank had run out of work in downtown Los Angeles around 11 p.m. He has his sweater, he puts on his headphones to listen to music, and he puts on his backpack. Frank liked to take his backpack to work, because he could take a change of clothes to work, so he wouldn't have to wear his uniform after he left. To get home, Frank had to take a bus and a train, but he didn't care because he could listen to music.

After getting off the train, Frank got something to eat in a small restaurant that remained open late and served burgers. After eating, Frank still had to walk for 30 minutes. As Frank walked down a small street with lots of houses, he realized there was a car behind him slowly following him. He looked back and noticed it was a police car. He didn't care because he wasn't doing anything illegal, so he kept walking.
When Frank was about to get home, the police car turned on the lights and drove directly to where Frank was. They stopped and left the car. The two cops surrounded Frank. Frank was used to this, and he put his hands in the air. The police officers told him to put his hands on the hood, which he did.
As Frank was being searched, he asked the police officers why he was being searched. They ignored him and asked him questions. ""Do you have anything illegal on you? Have you been arrested before? Do you have a gun?"" Frank answered ""no,"" to all his questions. Frank was put in the back of the police car. Frank asked again why he was being searched. One officer said, ""Because you're walking around the neighborhood with a hoodie."" Frank hadn't done anything wrong, so the police let him go after they searched his backpack.",A2

"Charles and Richard were known at school for being troublemakers. They were not allowed to attend the school dance because they had been caught trying to sneak into the girls' locker room. Although Charles and Richard always got into trouble, sometimes they didn't deserve it. They had a bad reputation. That's what happens when you have a bad reputation. The school dance was coming up. Charles and Richard had a plan on how to sneak in. This time they were very troublesome.

It was the tradition that before every dance, the school band performed the school song. Along with the band, our mascot went dancing. Our pet was a bulldog, but we had both a male and a bulldog female. Charles and Richard decided to go to the ball as bulldogs. They convinced the students that they were going to be the pets not to go.
On the night of the dance, Charles and Richard entered the gym like pets. They were dancing and running down the dance floor like pets are supposed to do. Then the principal came to say a few words and introduce the school band. Charles and Richard had a plan. After the band started playing, they got behind the director and started taking him.

"Amisa was a single mother who worked from home tutoring students. He liked this job because it allowed him to stay home with his own daughter Nimisha. Amisa saw all her clients at her kitchen table. He chose the kitchen table because from there he could see his daughter, who usually stayed in the living room. Nimisha usually stayed in the living room when her mother was working with another student.

One afternoon, however, Nimisha felt so thirsty. He had to go into the kitchen for a drink. ""Mom, can I have a drink, please?"" Nimisha asked. Amisa was upset. I was in the middle of a lesson. ""Yes, but you have to serve yourself because I'm working,"" Amisa said. Nimisha pulled a staircase into the kitchen closet and stood on it. He opened the kitchen cabinet and reached the top shelf to get a blue plastic cup. Then it slipped. Nimesha screamed loudly. When Amisa got up to see what was wrong, she saw that her daughter's hand had slipped and that the tongs of a large fork had passed through Nimisha's finger. Nimisha was crying. Amisa was scared. She made her client go home early, and she was taking her daughter to the hospital. She didn't want to try to pull out the fork herself because she was worried it might make the situation worse.
Nimisha lived four blocks from the hospital. She felt it was faster to walk to the hospital than to call and wait for an ambulance. There was only one problem. It was very cold outside, and Amisa couldn't put a coat on her daughter when she had a huge fork sticking out of one of her fingers.

"
As a waiter in one of the busiest clubs in Los Angeles, Daniel King often saw a lot of strange things. During the last party he worked, he saw five people throwing up on the dance floor, two fights, and a girl losing her top in front of everyone. The weirdest thing that happened to Daniel was when a drunk girl asked him to dance. He denied it at first, but when she had another drink again, she dragged him to the dance floor.

The girls had dragged Daniel to the dance floor before, but this time it was different. The girls who dragged him before really knew how to dance, but this girl didn't do it and she was drunk. She kept jumping up and down. By waving his body and looking Daniel straight into his eyes. She was so drunk, she kept bumping into the other people who were dancing.
While playing the music, the girl kept jumping and dancing. I was yelling at Daniel that I had to go to the bathroom, but he couldn't hear her. He yelled at Daniel one more time and that's when it happened. He had an accident on the dance floor. Some of his urine actually got in Daniel's shoes. After it happened, the girl was so embarrassed that she ran out of the club crying. Daniel couldn't believe what happened. He told people to get out of the way, while his friend came to clean the dance floor.
The weird thing about that incident was that the girl came back the next day looking for her cell phone, but she didn't remember Daniel. Daniel wanted to hide, because he thought she'd recognize him, but he didn't. Daniel decided he'd never go dancing with another girl while he was working.",A2

"Gabriel loved working as a waiter. He loved going to work during the holidays like Christmas, Thanksgiving and Easter. When there was work during the holidays, it usually meant there would be a big tip on his check. He was very kind to people, and everyone liked to work with him. The restaurant where I worked was making a special brunch for Easter this year. Jackie, Gabriel's boss, called him to see if he could work. Gabriel said yes.

When Gabriel showed up, he saw a giant Easter bunny walking around the restaurant. He started laughing at himself. I'd always wanted to wear a costume, and go around talking to people. When people started showing up, they realized that the Easter bunny wasn't going out to greet people. Gabriel had a job to do. He began to clean the tables that were assigned to him; when he finished, he went to take his rest.
While eating, Jackie approached Gabriel and said, ""I think we need you to take care of yourself as an Easter bunny, would you be willing to do that?"" Gabriel said, of course, because he didn't want to disappoint the boss, but also because he secretly wanted to. As he went out fully dressed as the Easter Rabbit, he saw children lining up to take pictures with him. He came up and took pictures with everyone in line.
There was a little train for the children in the garden. After taking the photos, he decided to get on the train and ride it with the children. The children asked him if he was the real Easter rabbit, and if he had been to Disneyland, Gabriel nodded. After getting off the train, he walked around the restaurant and began dancing in the restaurant. People began to applaud as they ate. It was the first time Gabriel dressed like the Easter Rabbit, but he loved it every second.",A2
"Last week Chris was on his first offshore fishing trip off the coast of Catalina Island. She had always enjoyed fishing when she was a child, but she had never gone fishing in the ocean. His father liked to fish very often. Her older brother Jack was never the outdoor type, so her father took her out often. One of his favorite places was Lake Isabella, which was about two hours away from his house. She remembers how she and her father spent a long, quiet day driving to the lake, and then taking their little boat to the water. It was quiet and peaceful for the most part. Those memories are still some of his most precious moments of his life.

Chris has a friend named Robert. On this day, Robert invited Chris to join him on his company's fishing trip. Robert said it wouldn't cost much, but it would be so much fun. He knew Chris enjoyed fishing on the lake and thought she would have a great time. ""It's okay,"" Chris said, and they went to the ocean.
The first thing Chris noticed, however, was the motion. ""Wow, this boat is really great,"" Chris told Robert. ""Don't worry about it. You'll get used to it,"" he said. The trip to the waters of Catalina Island took about an hour. Chris marveled at how quickly he lost sight of the continent. It was a little scary when he thought about how alone they were in this great ocean. Soon, it was time to collect squid for bait. The small ship stopped in the water, and the crew turned the bright light into the ocean to attract the squid. In a short time, thousands of squid went up to the surface and were collected as bait.
After about an hour, Chris no longer felt the rocking movement. They were ready to fish. Chris took his first ocean trout. It was a beautiful day.",A2
"Age does not matter when it comes to helping those in need. Shane's a 9-year-old boy who loves to help. During a school trip, Shane's class went to visit a warehouse where people donate food and clothing for the homeless. Shane was inspired by the workers he saw there. When he got home, he told his mother all about his field trip. Shane told his mother he wanted to go help.

A week later, Shane's mother told him the good news. They were going to help out in a local kitchen that gave food to the homeless. Shane got excited. He's got his coat and his shoes. When Shane and his mother were coming to the local kitchen, Shane saw how all the homeless people lived. He saw the tents on the street and how some people didn't even have shoes. He became sad, and told his mother that he was going to make sure everyone had shoes, food and blankets.
When they came in, the kitchen manager thanked Shane and his mother for coming to help. They started serving food to the homeless and everyone who stopped by to thank Shane for coming to help. Shane felt safe and started talking to the homeless. He told them he wanted to help them. When they finished, Shane didn't want to leave, but they had to.
Shane told his mother he wanted to do more. During school, Shane asked his teacher to let him say something to the class. He told them what he had seen. He asked his friends and his teacher if they had any clothes they no longer wore, so he could donate them. His friends brought clothes the next day, but his teacher did something better. She brought her friend, who was a reporter, and published a story about Shane about how much she wanted to help the homeless. Thousands of people donated clothes and food.

The police caught Carl and his friend while eating in a restaurant next to high school. They were taken to jail.

Carl admitted to burning the auditorium, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Your friend has the same thing. The judge asked them why they did it, and Carl said, ""Because we were bored and we didn't like school.""
The news reporters were at school. They wanted to talk to the parents, who were at school talking to the police and the principal.

"Music had always played an important role in Jonathan's life. He liked different kinds of music, from Hip-Hop to Rock 'n' Roll. One of his favorite bands was The Beatles. I could hear them every day. Jonathan didn't feel that way about any other band. He had all his albums, and he knew all the lyrics on his songs.

One day, Jonathan and his girlfriend Sarah went for a walk in Jonathan's car. Sarah was excited to show Jonathan a new band she had heard of. Sarah brought the CD and played it for Jonathan while driving around town. The first song was called 40 Day Dream, and the band's name was Edward Sharpe and The Magnetic Zeroes. Jonathan didn't think much of them at first, maybe because he was driving, but after they stopped driving, he had the song stuck in his head.
Jonathan decided to look for his albums. They had three outside, so Jonathan decided to buy them all. During a rainy day, Jonathan invited Sarah home and listened to the three albums. Jonathan loved the band. He loved how they sounded like bands from the past. He loved how they reminded him of the Beatles.
When he and Sarah were listening to the third album, the song If I are Free appeared. Jonathan jumped out of his bed and started dancing alone. Sarah looked at him, smiled and laughed. Jonathan started clapping, and then he started singing. ""The light became too heavy, and I fell into a dream,"" he sang. She fell next to Sarah, looked at her and said, ""I feel like I'm in a dream when I hear this band. Thank you for introducing me to them.""",A2

"Getting a driver's license is very important for a 16-year-old. Today was my 16th birthday, and my father promised to take me to the Motor Vehicle Department to do my driving test. I already passed my written test, so it was for a road test today. When we got to DMV, I started getting really nervous. I was driving my father's car, and I didn't want to spoil and crash. My father looked at me and told me everything would be fine.

I'd been up all night thinking about how I'd go and if I'd pass the test. When the driver's instructor came out, he told me to get in the car and turn on the lights. I did what I was told. Then he told me to turn on the turning signal to the left, and then the turning signal to the right. They both worked, so it was time to start driving. The instructor had dark sunglasses, and he didn't say much when we got into the car.
The instructor gave me instructions to go straight and make a right turn at the next stop sign, which was a couple of blocks away. I did what I was told, and then I went straight. Then the instructor told me to go straight until I reached a street called Marengo and then turn left. While driving, I kept looking for Marengo Street, and I thought I could pass it and the instructor would deduct points from my exam.
When I finally found Marengo Street, I turned around to tell the instructor. That's when I realized I was asleep. I couldn't believe it. This was an important event in my life, an event that I had been worried about for months. When we finished, he woke up and told me that he had done a good job, and that he was going to get my license in about a month. I laughed and thanked him. I went to tell my father the good news.",A2
"Tom noticed that every morning, when he went to school, his mother gave him a letter to get into the mailbox on the corner. ""Who are you writing so much to?"" He asked. ""I'm trying my luck,"" Tom's mother told him.

A few weeks after Tom began sending the letters, he realized that his mother was receiving much more mail. Part of the mail advertised in the envelope that she could already be a winner. His mother was also receiving many more magazines. Some of the magazines referred to things that his mother didn't care about, like cats.
""Mom, why do you have so many magazines?"" Tom asked her. He told her that he had been participating in competitions and that part of the process included subscription to magazines. ""It will increase my chances of winning the jackpot,"" he said. Soon the family mailbox was filled with more ads from contests, magazines and bills.
Tom's mother was surprised. She didn't think checking the boxes of magazines that seemed interesting and putting stickers on the return forms would cost her. He spent more and more money and had earned nothing. He wanted to be like the people in the ads he saw on TV. People who brought balloons and large cheques surprised people who entered the contests. Tom read the fine print. The magazines were not free and Tom's mother did not increase her chances of earning anything by subscribing. Tom did some research and discovered that there had even been lawsuits against companies running the contests and selling subscriptions to the magazine.
Tom's mother felt bad. ""It's worth winning, Mom, but you can't pay to win,"" Tom said. Tom's mother wondered what she was going to do with all these magazines.",A2
"Jenny had always wanted a pet of her own. She wanted something to take care of, someone to be there every time she came home, and above all, an animal to be best friends with. Jenny constantly asked her father to buy her a pet, but her father always refused. Jenny's father knew having a pet was a big responsibility. I didn't think Jenny was ready to have a pet at ten years of age, and that's exactly what she said when she asked for one. ""When will I be ready?"" Jenny asked one day. ""Wait till you're twelve,"" Jenny's father answered. This was good news for Jenny. All I had to do now was be patient.

It had been two years. Jenny had been counting the days on her calendar. On the morning of her twelfth birthday, Jenny jumped onto her father's bed and immediately reminded her of what she had said two years ago. ""Have you decided which pet to get?"" Jenny's father asked. Jenny couldn't answer. I hadn't decided what kind of pet I wanted. ""Let me think about it,"" he said and ran to his room.
Jenny took into account all the pets she could imagine. He imagined a spongy white cat that he would call Tabby or a great brilliant gold retriever with which he would call Amarillo and play Frisbee in the afternoons. I imagined having a colorful macaw I'd call Polly and having conversations with every time she felt lonely. After an hour of weighing the options, Jenny had made a decision.
Jenny's father was surprised when he discovered which pet his daughter had chosen. ""I want a horse,"" he said when he returned to his father's bedroom. ""How about something a little less expensive,"" she told Jenny. ""A pony?"" He answered cleverly. ""Let's go to the pet store,"" Jenny's father said.",A2

"Carla moved to San Francisco two years ago. His whole family was in Boston. Every year he tried to visit his family twice. She went once in the summer and once during the Christmas holidays. However, traveling across the country was expensive. He needed to find a way to save money on his trip. He decided to try to use an airline loyalty program to see if that would help.

There was an airline where Carla preferred to travel. Every time I used that airline, there were hardly any delays and the trip was always comfortable. That airline offered DIRECTV in the seat, so you could watch their favorite TV shows while traveling. He could also order food and drinks from his seat. An extra benefit was that each seat had an electrical outlet. This made it easy for Carla to connect her computer and work on her journey.
On her last trip, Carla decided to enroll in that airline's loyalty program. I earned points for every trip I made. These points could be used for air travel. The airline worker informed Carla that he could earn even more points if he signed up for the airline-sponsored credit card. The card had a low interest rate and no annual charge. For every dollar Carla spent, she earned a point to use for travel. Carla signed up for the credit card. He had good credit, so he was approved. Carla used that credit card to pay a ticket back and forth to Boston.
After a single trip, Carla had earned enough points for a free one-way ticket. That saved him almost $500. It felt like traveling for free. Carla decided to remain loyal to this airline.",A2

"Nancy Young had always loved to celebrate July 4, the party celebrating the independence of the United States. He loved the meaning of the day. He also loved to light fireworks. He loved all kinds of fireworks. Nancy had three brothers, and everyone loved it on July 4. Nancy's younger brother, Peter, loved to light the fireworks. Although Nancy's parents didn't have that much money, they decided to buy a lot of fireworks for their children. They wanted their children to have a big July 4th. Once they received the fireworks, Nancy decided to divide them with her brothers. She got the majority, and her brothers got the rest.

Nancy's parents decided to go to the park to light the fireworks this year. Peter decided to turn on the first one. It exploded and scared Nancy. Nancy decided to light one. It was a spark, which meant it would only send sparks into the sky, and it wouldn't explode. Nancy loved the way it looked. He lit another one to see what it would look like. Peter had the idea of jumping over the fireworks. Even though Nancy said no, Peter decided to jump on it.
Peter got ready. He tied his shoes to make sure that his laces weren't hung on his shoes, and that he had enough distance to jump on the sparks. Peter started running and then jumped. When he landed on the other side, he started screaming in pain. A spark had entered Peter's eye. He fell to the ground and started ordering ice. Nancy brought him an ice pack to cover his eye.

"Emma Johnny's son had been bothering her about joining a sports team like all her friends. One day he took Johnny to the local recreational center, where they were running baseball tests. He learned the evidence of a banner that he saw hanging outside the recreation center as he passed by. Baseball seemed like the perfect sport for Johnny to learn how to play, as he is nicknamed the Pastime of America.

Emma took her son to the tests after school. ""I'm sorry,"" one of the coaches told Emma. ""Johnny was too young to try for baseball. Since I was six, I could try out for T-ball, though.""
T-ball is similar to baseball, except there's no pitcher. Instead, the ball is placed on a support called ""T"" because of its shape. This makes it easier for younger children to hit. T-ball games are also shorter than regular baseball games. Regular baseball matches last nine innings. Emma couldn't imagine her son standing for nine minutes.
T-ball sounded like a good way to introduce your child to the responsibilities of being on a sports team and the rules of baseball. Emma had to bring Johnny back on a different day to try out for T-ball. When he did, they put him on a team. After paying a fee, Johnny got a uniform. Johnny looked at the back of his uniform. ""Hey, look! Mom. I'm number one!"" He said proudly.
Once Johnny started playing, however, it was clear to Emma that he wasn't very good at baseball. He stayed with him, however, and his team finished the season in fourth place. There were only four teams in the T-ball league. ""I can play again next season,"" Johnny asked his mother. ""Yes, but see if you can get another number,"" he said.",A2

"My job is a long distance from my house, almost 50 miles away. I have to get up early every morning, since I'm always in a hurry. There's never enough time for a relaxed breakfast. Exactly 6:00 a.m., I get in my car and start the long journey.
I usually like driving on the road more than in the city. However, during the rush hour of the morning, it is not very pleasant. Heavy traffic is a little annoying. So I always listen to my favorite classical music CDs in the car: Chopin, Mozart and Bach. I'm so happy about that.
The trip to work takes about an hour. Going home at night after work takes even longer, perhaps around 70 minutes. I've been thinking lately about trying to take the train to work instead of driving. That way, I could still listen to my music with headphones, and even read a novel at the same time.",A2

"""Hi Dolly"" is one of the American classics. It was first shown in New York in 1964 and won 10 Tony Awards. The Tony Awards are the live version of the Oscars. When I was in high school, our theater department decided to put in our version of ""Hi Dolly"", and I just had to get involved. I wasn't an actor, but I was hoping I could do something, so I went to the director and asked him if he needed help. To my surprise, he said yes!

The director's name was Michael Thomas. I almost screamed for pleasure when he told me I could be part of the play. ""Oh, my God!"" I said. ""I'd love to be a stage designer. Are you kidding me?"" A stage designer is someone who moves all the accessories and the background between the acts. It is a precision work that requires coordination between several people. I loved working in the ""wings"", which is what the backstage called in theater jargon. The stage director is the person who directs the backstage during a play, and the work carries a lot of responsibility. My first stage director was a great guy who liked him a lot, so I got the best assignments. ""Hey George, would you like to handle the lighting?"" He asked, and I took the opportunity.
""Of course, boss!"" I answered. That's how they put me in charge of lighting for one of the best works ever written. Even though this was just a high school production, we played in packed houses almost every night we were in. I did a great job that when the theater department decided to put on ""West Side Story"" next semester, they asked me if I wanted to join the team. It was a great honor to be selected, so of course my answer was yes!",A2

"Francesca picked up her seven-year-old son from school one afternoon. Isaac proudly showed his mother what he had done at school that day. It was a card made of brightly colored construction paper. ""It's for Father's Day,"" Isaac explained. The card was cut into the shape of a man's shirt wearing a drawing of a man's tie. Inside the card, Isaac had written the words ""Happy Father's Day.""

Francesca was not familiar with Father's Day as it was not something celebrated in her country of origin. So he asked his neighbor Genny about it. Genny told him that Father's Day, like Mother's Day, is a party invented in the United States. It is always celebrated on the second Sunday in June. People give parents cards, gifts, go out to eat in a restaurant, or do something special that day. ""It's a day to show gratitude to your father,"" Genny explained.
Francesca understood, but she also felt a little bad. While Father Isaac's Day card was nice, Isaac's father never wore a shirt or tie. Isaac's father, Tim, was wearing a uniform to work. On his days off, he liked to dress casually and comfortably. The most dressed he got was for wearing a polo shirt.
Francesca had an idea. She went shopping the day before Father's Day to surprise her husband. On the morning of Father's Day, she and Isaac gave Tim a box wrapped in a good paper. ""Happy Father's Day,"" Francesca and Tim shouted.
When Tim unwrapped the box, he laughed. Inside the box was Father Isaac's Day card made at school. Also inside the box was a dress shirt and a tie. They were the same color as the card Isaac made. Tim, Francesca and Isaac went to Genny's house for a barbecue. Tim was wearing his shirt and tie.",A2
"David's cell phone started vibrating in the middle of the night. He woke up immediately and approached his bedside table nervously. He always put his cell phone on vibrating and carried it by his bed when he went to sleep. David looked at the time on his cell phone. It was two o'clock in the morning. The only time someone contacted him at that time was when there was an emergency.

He read the message on his cell phone. It was an emergency. The text message said that a young boy had been abducted near where David lived. The boy had been taken to an orange Honda Civic. The text message also gave the car's license plate number. There was also a photo of the young child and a written description of what the child was wearing when he was abducted. The boy's name was Adam.

David had never heard of an amber alert before. He decided to look it up on his computer. He learned that the amber alert system is an emergency transmission system used to inform people when a child is abducted. He was named after a girl named Amber Hagerman, who was kidnapped while riding a bicycle in Texas. Little Amber was found dead later.
The news made David sad and angry, but he also felt that he could now do something to help. He decided to keep up to date to see if he saw a child or a car matching the description on the Amber Alert.",A2

Karen loves to dress Julie in pretty full pastel colors with bows and ribbons. Karen thinks she's the most beautiful girl in the world. The other day, the little family went shopping, and suddenly, Karen let out a loud scream! ""Oh, my God!"" Jack ran over thinking something had gone wrong. ""What's going on?"" He asked. ""Nothing,"" she replied. ""Look at this lovely outfit. It's perfect for little Julie,"" she said. Jack got a little upset about this. He ran to Karen thinking she had fallen or something had happened to Julie, but all that happened was that she found a nice blue dress for her girl.
Shopping malls in the United States are all over the country. Some are very large, but most of them have between 50 and 100 stores each. These are places where people are going to eat and buy, or go to a movie, or just hang out with friends. U.S. teens love these places, especially in Los Angeles, when it's really hot. The children go there to cool off. It was no surprise Karen wanted to go there and buy little Julie her dress.

"Johnny's always loved taking long walks. He lived near Griffith Park in Los Angeles. The park is very beautiful. It has trees and winding roads leading to the hills where it could be lost for hours. Every time he walked there, he always felt at peace with the world and with himself. It was his personal safe area.

One day Johnny was climbing a trail he hadn't tried before, and soon he got lost. Griffith Park is very big and people have been lost there in the past, but I knew I would find a way back. After about an hour of walking in circles, Johnny heard something move through the bushes. I scared him for a second, but he kept walking.
It was starting to get dark and he started thinking that he might have to spend the night in a cave or under a rock or something. That's when he heard the most noise coming from the trail. It was very noisy. ""Hey!"" Johnny screamed. ""What's out there? Get away from me!"" I was sure he was a coyote or maybe a mountain lion. He started looking for something to fight in case of an attack. Johnny was in complete panic and began to tremble uncontrollably as the noise approached more and more. Just when he thought an animal was going to jump out of the bushes, he saw the most beautiful girl he'd ever seen. She was tall and blonde and had long straight hair and the first thing she said was, ""Are you okay?""
Turned out her name was Sheila, and she was a park ranger. She told Johnny that she had seen him climb the trail before, but she didn't see him go back down, so she decided to go up and see if everything was okay. Johnny's never been so embarrassed in his life, but that was good. The couple ended up getting married a little over a year after that. He saved Johnny's life that day, in more than one way.",A2
"""You want me to buy you what?"" Ken asked Elizabeth. I was sure I hadn't heard it correctly. Elizabeth had just moved in with Ken. He came to Los Angeles from New York City after a year of long-distance dating. ""I want you to buy me a shopping cart,"" Elizabeth repeated. ""In Los Angeles there are two types of people who use shopping carts. The homeless are one. They use shopping carts to carry their possessions. The old ladies are second. They use it to bring their clothes back and forth, their groceries, and perhaps even to sell tamales,"" Ken explained.

Elizabeth was insulted. ""Are you saying I'm an old woman?"" She asked. He then continued to explain that he did not want to rely on Ken to take her to the supermarket or laundry. Elizabeth couldn't drive, but she wanted to be self-sufficient. ""In addition,"" he continued, ""everybody in New York City has a shopping cart, not just the homeless or the elderly.""
One afternoon, when Elizabeth returned from work, there was a red shopping cart at the entrance. Ken had put a big red bow on it. ""Do you like your new wheels?"" Ken asked Elizabeth. He was happy now that he could handle some chores on his own.
The next day he loaded the shopping cart with dirty clothes and set off to walk the three blocks to the nearest laundry. This wasn't as easy as she thought. The sidewalks were uneven and the car was often jammed, causing the dirty socks to jump out of the car. Elizabeth had to stop several times to pick up lost clothes. Then almost all the houses between his house and the laundry had a big dog barking at him. Elizabeth hated big, scary dogs.",A2
"Hi, is this the Smith residence?
Hey, how can I help you today?
I'm very upset with the quality of your service.
I'm sorry, what seems to be the problem?
My Internet service didn't work for three days.
My records say a technician visited your area yesterday?
Yeah, he set up a new modem.
Did you solve the problem?
Yeah, but I was charged too much for the Internet service.
I'm sorry. I'll give you credit for the three days.
They sold me an unavailable wireless service in my area.
I see him here; we charge you $5 extra a month.
Yeah. Kindly return my money, please.",A2
"José Luis was taking the train to work one day when he realized that a woman with a large German Shepard was on the train. This made him nervous. What if that dog attacked someone? José Luis did not know that people could take pets with them to the trains. He seemed insecure. He approached the dog. The German Shepard seemed quite friendly. Just as he stretched out his hand to caress the dog, the woman stopped him.

""Please don't caress him. He's working,"" the lady told him. José Luis didn't understand. The woman explained that she was blind and that the Hampton dog acted like her eyes, helping her navigate the city. The woman pointed to the special vest Hampton was wearing. The vest was printed with the words ""service animal"".
José Luis had never heard of service animals before. ""Service animals like Hampton are allowed to enter public places that most pets do not. Hampton's more than a pet. It helps me become self-sufficient and do the things I need to do in the city,"" the woman explained. The woman also told José Luis that the service animals had to undergo special training to learn to behave in public places and not to be distracted. ""People need to help too, however, by not caressing him,"" the woman added.
The woman continued to explain that service animals not only help the blind. Some animals act as therapy animals. The therapy animals go to hospitals and nursing homes. These animals lower the stress levels of people who are very sick or have just been operated on. They also encourage people to recover. Therapy animals are especially popular in children's hospitals. Dogs can really be man's best friends.",A2
"John had been saving his assignment for three weeks so he could buy a telescope he had seen advertised in the paper. According to the announcement, the telescope cost $94.99. John also did some weird jobs around the neighborhood where he lived. He cut the neighbor's lawn and took another neighbor's dog for a walk. I finally had $95.

One Saturday John walked to the store. He had brought with him the ad, which he had taken out of the paper. He asked a salesman at the store where he could find the telescope announced. He took out the newspaper ad and showed it to the seller to make sure they took it to the right. The salesman showed John where the telescopes were and together they looked for the one he wanted. Her name was Vega 600.
""I found it!"" John told the salesman. The seller confirmed that the Vega 600 cost $94.99 and brought the box to the cash register so John could pay for it. John was very excited. I wanted to jump up and down. I'd worked so hard to get this.
""That'll be $104.01,"" the salesman told John. ""Did you announce it as $94.99?"" John asked angryly. He thought the seller was trying to take advantage of him. ""Yes, it is, but we have to add taxes to sales. It's the law. In California the sales tax is 9.5 percent,"" explained the seller. ""Why don't you put the final price on the ads and price labels then?"" John asked. ""Then everything seems more expensive and people don't come to the store to buy,"" the seller explained. ""Everything is more expensive!"" John said angry, leaving the store without the telescope.

"Marie and Mark have been dating for four months. The relationship is moving fast. They're already talking about a future together, including moving in together. For Marie this also means transferring her two children from an earlier marriage. Marie's kids call Mark ""Dad.""

Marie and Mark ""see each other"" almost every day and yet they have never met. Marie lives in the city of Terrace and Mark lives in Houston. They started chatting in an online chat room. How they look is through video chat programs like Skype. Text messages are constantly sent to each other and photos are sent to each other.
Marie asks her friend Bella for advice. Bella met her husband Dan on Twitter four years ago and moved from New York to Los Angeles to be with him. However, it was different from the situation of Marie and Mark.
Bella and Dan had friends in common, although they lived on opposite coasts of the United States.

Dan and Bella traveled back and forth for over a year before they decided to move in with another and make a life together. Bella, like Marie, has two children from a previous marriage. Bella's kids don't call Dan ""Dad.""
Bella warns Marie not to go too deep. He tells Marie that Mark has to come visit Los Angeles. Marie can go to Houston, too.

"Robert Lee and his brothers were excited about the new movie ""Godzilla"" that was coming out. The day the film came out, Robert and his brothers went to the theater early. Robert's brothers wanted to see another movie first, and then they wanted to sneak into Godzilla. Robert didn't care, because he liked to go to the movies. When they arrived at the theater, Robert bought his popcorn brothers, soft drinks and some sweets. When they got it all, they went to get their seats.

Robert's brothers didn't like the first movie they saw, but they were excited to watch Godzilla. When they came out of the first movie, Robert went to get more sodas and popcorn, because his brothers had finished everything. Robert's brothers broke into the theater, and they were waiting for Robert to come back with the appetizers. When Robert tried to see Godzilla again, a security guard asked for his ticket. Robert didn't have one for Godzilla, so the security guard had to kick him out.
Robert had to go out and buy another ticket for Godzilla. He felt ashamed, because he had to be on the line with popcorn and soda. People in line and people working at the locker looked at Robert and found him funny. Robert knew they were watching him, because they knew he was thrown out for trying to sneak into another movie. His face turned red. He thought he'd call his brothers so they could go home. Robert thought about how his brothers wanted to see the movie too, so he bought the ticket and went back in. The security guard looked at him again and asked for his ticket. Robert showed it to her and went to the theater. The security guard laughed.",A2

He couldn't fix the problem. I didn't know what the problem was. He had taken it to another mechanic. I knew what the problem was. I needed new spark plugs. He put up the new spark plugs.

"When Mario was 19, he bought his first car. It was a new Toyota Corolla from 1985. I was on top of the world! It was beautiful, and it was very fast and fun to drive. Living in Southern California without a car is not a good idea. The region is so widespread that it could take hours to get from one part of the city to another if public transport is used. You're nobody in L.A. if you don't have a car, or at least that's what some people say.

Before that, Mario had never had or bought a car in his life. His father warned him about the vendors. ""Never pay the price you ask for, son,"" he said. Mario looked at him with disbelief. ""Why do you take me, Dad? I'm not an idiot. I know I don't have to pay the first offer,"" he shouted. His father offered to go with him to the car dealer, but Mario wanted to go alone. It was his money and his car, and he was determined to do this alone.
When Mario arrived at the car dealer, a good man approached him and asked him if he wanted to take the car he was looking for for a driving test. Mario said, ""Yes, of course."" So they went for a walk. Mario fell in love with the car and the seller knew immediately that he was going to make some money. Turns out you should never let a salesman know you're interested in anything you want to buy. Mario didn't know how to negotiate and ended up paying too much for the car. But he didn't care. He owned his first car. When he told his father what he paid for him, he thought his father would be angry, but he said, ""Okay, son. That same dealer ripped me off when I bought my first car, too.""",A2

"Many years ago, one of the best ways to spend a Saturday night with your girlfriend was to take her to the drive-in. The cinemas opened for the first time in Southern California because of the car culture that exists here. People could go see a movie in the comfort and privacy of their own car. I remember the first time I went to a drive-in. I was 18 years old and dated my future wife Caroline. We went on a double date with my best friend Alfred and his girl Jeannie. The entrance we visited that night was called ""The Starlight"". I was close to home, and I had the best sound system of all drive-ins. It also had a huge screen. We went to see ""Forrest Gump"" that night, mainly because Carol wanted to see it. ""I heard it's a great movie,"" he said. I didn't really know anything about the movie, but I wanted to see something.

Forrest Gump was in fact one of the best films ever made. He had it all: humor, drama, tragedy and triumph. It's a great movie. Seeing him that night under the stars with Carol on my arm was the best night. ""I'm telling you, baby, I was wrong about this movie. I really liked it,"" I said. She just smiled and gave me a hug. Alfred and Jeannie were busy kissing in the back seat, which is another advantage of going to a drive-in.
Those old drive-ins were out there for decades, but soon after ""Forrest Gump"" came out, many of them started shutting down. They closed because of the new multiplex cinemas appearing all over the country. People had the choice of many movies to watch in those theaters, and soon the drive-in was gone. In L.A., there's only one car I know... the Vineland. There may be more, but I don't know where. It's sad to see them leave, but the memories are still with me.",A2

"Helen was out watering her lawn like she does every day. He loves his lawn and his garden. She has the prettiest house on the block, but it's only because she works on it very hard. Helen's in the mid-40s, but you wouldn't know looking at her. His face is almost wrinkled, and it looks like he's got more energy than people half his age.

""Good morning, Helen."" I said as I walked out on my way to work. ""Hi Robert, how are you?"" She asked. ""Good! I'm doing good. Your yard looks good,"" I said. And it was. Sometimes it bothers me that I can't make my lawn look as pretty as hers. ""What's your secret, Helen?"" I asked. ""Secret of what?"" He answered. ""For having such a beautiful lawn! I water mine, I sow mine every year and I still can't get it to look as good as yours. I'm jealous!"" I said with a smile. Helen nodded and had a funny look on her face that suggested it was better to keep her lawn nice than me.
I didn't like that look, but I guess it's okay for her to feel that way. I've known Helen since she was a kid and things haven't been going well with her lately. She's been alone a long time. She wasn't very pretty when she was young. He had a terrible acne that covered his face from ear to ear. It made her very self-conscious so she didn't go out much on dates, but everything changed when she met Josh. They were together for more than 10 years until, sadly, they went on separate paths. Since then, Helen has nurtured and cared for her garden as if it were her son.

"I left school at 7 p.m. and had nothing to do with it, so I started walking home. I lived an hour away from my school, so I got home around 8 p.m. When I opened the door to get in, I saw my brother, my mom and my brother's girlfriend sitting on the couch. My brother Jeff was sitting with his girlfriend Betty. I came in slowly. I looked at my mother, who had tears in her eyes. He was very tense. I turned to Jeff. ""She's pregnant!"" Jeff said.

Jeff and his girlfriend started laughing and they said, ""Yeah!"" I started jumping up and down with joy. I always wanted to be an uncle. My first reaction was to start screaming, ""It wasn't me! It wasn't me!"" I started screaming that because my parents always thought I was gonna be the first to give them a grandchild. They certainly didn't think Jeff was gonna do it. I gave each one a hug, and wished them luck.
After eight and a half months had passed, Betty gave birth to a beautiful baby. My family and I were as happy as I could be. They called baby Mark. Mark was my father's name, who passed away a year ago. My brother said he looked like my father, so he decided to give him the name in honor of my father. We all met at the hospital and started laughing, talking. Everyone took turns taking the baby. It was the happiest moment in our family's history. We just wanted my father to be a part of it. Jeff looked at baby Mark. He told me my father's spirit was here. He'd always be there to look after Mark. I smiled and gave him a hug.",A2
"Ruth Campbell had never been to Disneyland as a child. I was now 40 years old with two children, a boy and a girl. The boy's name was Jeff and the girl's name was Carol. When Jeff was 11 years old and Carol 13, Ruth decided to take her children to Disneyland, which would be the first time any of them left. When they arrived in Disneyland, Ruth explained to her children that if they separated, they would find themselves at the front of the park.

The first thing Ruth did when they came in was find Mickey Mouse. I wanted to take pictures with all Disneyland characters. He even made a list of the characters he wanted to take pictures with. Her children looked at her and smiled. They saw that her mother was acting like a child again. He laughed every time he took a picture with a character.
His favorite Disney character was Donald Duck, so he kept an eye open for him. When they were in line for a walk, he saw Donald taking pictures with people in a restaurant. She said to her children, ""Look, guys, it's Donald! Hopefully, he's still there when we get out."" When they left the trip, Donald was no longer there. Ruth told her children she was fine, and they would run into him later.
They enjoyed their day in Disneyland until it was time to close the park. Ruth and her children watched the fireworks they put on every night in Disneyland. He hugged his children and told them he loved them. They hugged her and continued to watch the show. When they left the park, their children noticed that Donald was taking pictures with other people, and his mother had not yet noticed. Carol told her mother that she needed to go to the bathroom, and asked her mother to wait for her for a moment. While waiting for Carol to return from the bathroom, Ruth felt someone pushing her in the shoulder. It was Donald Duck with Carol! Ruth started to break a little bit, and hugged them both. They all took pictures with Donald Duck, the last character on Ruth's list.",A2

"When Donna was little, she had a dog named Sandy. Sandy was a hairy, brown, medium-sized dog. He weighed about 25 pounds, and he was a happy dog. Donna was only 10 years old, and she couldn't remember a day in her life without Sandy by her side. Sandy was Donna's best friend.

The two could be seen together in most days. Donna took care of Sandy every day. She fed her, brushed her and played with her. Donna left with Sandy when it was time to take her to the vet's office for a physical checkup. Donna always wanted to be with her hairy friend on those occasions because she didn't want Sandy to be lonely and scared. Donna was also responsible for cleaning up after Sandy, which meant picking up her poop. Donna didn't care. She loved Sandy.
One day, Donna and Sandy were coming back from the park. They were walking down the street near her house when Donna left Sandy without a leash. Donna knew she shouldn't leave her without a leash, but she always did when they were a few houses away. Sandy was running into the yard, screaming and howling while she was waiting for Donna to get home.
However, this day was different. Sandy saw a cat across the street and started running behind the cat just as Donna's neighbor was driving home. Sandy was run over and killed by the speeding car while Donna screamed in shock. ""No!"" Donna screamed, but it was too late. Sandy was gone. Donna was very sad. She blamed herself for Sandy's tragic death, but her mother told her Sandy was happy in Heaven now. Donna held a little service for her puppy and buried her in the backyard so Sandy would always be close to her. Donna knew they'd be back together.",A2

"It was a stupid mistake. Before I tell you about my mistake, I have to tell you about my father. My father Joseph Thomas was a great name in the music business. He kept a lot of different rock bands in the '60s. By the end of his career, he had saved some money and decided to buy himself a cabin in a small town in Oregon. I didn't want to live in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago or any other big city. He wanted to escape the life of the big city.

My father died in that cabin three years ago. I found out about his life at the cabin a week after his death. He never liked answering his cell phone. I'd always be on low battery, or off. He never bothered to load it. He just liked to listen to his records and drink whiskey.
During his time in the music industry, my father had collected several objects. He had different objects from different artists. He had one of Jimi Hendrix's guitars, and a medallion Janis Joplin had given him. Did you know this? No, I didn't. My father always kept himself. He was on the road a lot, and he never cared about keeping in touch with his children. So, when he died, I thought all his things in the cabin would be garbage. I told the sheriff in town to throw everything away. I also told him to send me the paperwork for the cabin. I read about the discovery they made in my father's cabin. I couldn't believe it! Hendrix's guitar was sold for over a million dollars, and also the medallion. As I had already asked Shariff to throw everything away like garbage, I had no right to anything, which probably made my father happy.",A2

"Three men once lived in a small town in Texas. One was a musician, another was an artist, and the other was a poor homeless man. One day the artist was going to start working on a new sculpture, but he didn't have the tools to start. He went downtown and saw a poor bum. Because the artist was new to the city and got lost, he asked the tramp where the nearest art shop was. The vagabond told him it was the red and white building around the corner. The artist looked at him and thanked him. He gave the homeless a ten-dollar bill with the words ""pass it forward"" written on the ticket. The bum took the money and said, ""God bless you!""

It had been a few hours and the bum started to get hungry. He walked around the city, and saw a young musician playing outside a café. The homeless man sat down and began to listen to the music played by the musician. A coffee bartender came out and told the bum he had to go, because he wasn't buying anything, and other people wanted to sit down and enjoy the music. The musician saw this and told the waiter to leave him alone and that he would like to buy something to eat for the bum. The waiter looked at the musician and said he was fine. The tramp thanked the musician. After he finished eating, he took out the ten-dollar bill and gave it to the musician. The bum's gone.
After the musician finished playing at the café, he decided to go to a local art festival with his girlfriend. As they walked and looked at all the different paintings and sculptures, the musician's girlfriend saw a sculpture she liked. He was a young man helping an older man who had fallen. I wanted to buy it, but I didn't have enough money. The musician told him not to worry. He took out ten dollars and gave it to the artist. As the musician and his girlfriend walked away, the artist looked at the ten-dollar bill and smiled. ""Well, look at that, you found your way back home,"" the artist said.",A2
"Callie noticed that her son Jesus, a senior high school student, was acting very strangely. He seemed to be hoarding his allowance and having many whispering conversations with his friends. When Callie asked Jesus about it, she admitted that she was nervous about the dance, a dance that was held at the end of high school for those graduating. Jesus felt a lot of pressure to ask a girl to be his date for the dance. The girls, like Lexi, also felt pressure on a guy who liked to ask the dance. A photographer would be at hand to capture in a movie for as long as he said yes.

Then there was the clothes thing. Young people like Jesus did not have to worry so much. Most of them only rent tuxedos. However, young women, such as Lexi, had to make sure that any dress they wore was unique. There's nothing more embarrassing than going to the dance and having another girl wear the same dress.
For parents, like Callie, one of the biggest stressors was money. Tickets for the dance cost $120 per student. Renting tuxedo costs a lot of money. Not to mention the fact that he traditionally had to buy his date a bouquet. Most students share the cost of a limousine with friends.
Callie had more than money in her mind, though. I'd heard stories about wild things happening on prom night. She was worried that Jesus would drink alcohol, even though he was a minor.
Callie encouraged her son not to worry so much about finding a date. Maybe I could go to the dance with a group of friends. That's what Jesus ended up doing. It was fine until it was time to be photographed. All Jesus ’ friends were divided into pairs. Jesus posed alone.",A2
"In a small town in California, a boy named Desmond Walker lived. Desmond lived with his parents in a three-bedroom red house. Desmond was ten years old and had an active imagination. His mother had a full hand watching Desmond. That kid of yours would get into all kinds of trouble. ""Always safety first, Desmond!"" is what he always repeated to his son.

Desmond and his mother went shopping on a Friday night. The supermarket parking lot was full of cars that Friday night. ""Stand close to me, Desmond,"" his mother said when they entered the supermarket. Desmond's mother asked him to bring a shopping cart. He grabbed a shopping cart, and he started going back to where his mother was. Desmond got in the shopping cart and ran at full speed. ""That's not very smart, Desmond,"" said a voice in Desmond's head. Desmond stopped and started pushing the car like before. He remembered what his mother always said to him: ""Always safety first.""
After Desmond delivered the car to his mother, the two went to the dairy section to drink some milk. ""Desmond, stay close to me,"" Desmond's mother said. The supermarket was full of buyers. Desmond was close to his mother as they walked carefully through people's hordes. So, in one case, Desmond thought of running away and hiding from his mother as a trick. Just as he was about to, Desmond heard the voice again. ""That's not a good idea, Desmond,"" the voice said. Desmond had remembered his mother's golden rule: ""Always safety first.""

"My last class of the day was my physical education class. I've always hated him. For the past three years, people had found ways to embarrass me. Things weren't that bad at first. Basketball hit me in the head when I was talking to a girl. I was trying to climb the big rope in the gym and I fell in front of everyone, who started laughing. The worst, however, had not yet happened.

At the end of a year, we always have a test to see how we've improved. We have to run a mile. The whole class does this at the same time. I wasn't the fastest racer, but I knew I could get a good score for this test. For this activity, we have to go to the locker room and change our uniforms. I left my uniform in my locker the other day since I was clean. When I opened my locker, I saw a note that said, ""Buy a new uniform, loser."" Someone had entered my locker and took my clothes. I told the master, he walked into his office and gave me an old uniform that had been left behind. ""Get ready and I'll see you out there,"" he said.
I tried to tie a rope around the shorts to fit, but they didn't. The bell rang, and I knew my teacher would be angry if I didn't come out. I started running, and I barely got there before he started giving names. After he finished the list, we started the test. The whole class ran away. I was doing well at first. After a while, people started passing me. A lot of people laughed at my shorts. Then it happened. Some guy pushed me out of his way, and I ended up falling. My shorts fell first, and then I fell to the ground. That's when all the girls started passing me. One of them shouted, ""He doesn't have clean underwear."" I took my shorts, and I walked the rest of the mile. It was the most embarrassing moment of my life.",A2
"Bobby loved to eat. He ate hamburgers, fries, hot dogs, pizza, doughnuts and ice cream, to name a few. No matter how much Bobby ate, he never had a stomachache. No wonder Bobby weighs 250 pounds. It may be surprising to know that Bobby is only fifteen years old. Bobby didn't care if it was big. He was happy with how he looked and loved to eat as much as he could.

Bobby liked to tell jokes to his friends. ""Tock, knock,"" Bobby would say. ""Who's there?"" Friends would ask. ""Gorilla,"" Bobby answered. ""Gorilla who""? They'd ask me. ""Swallow me a hamburger!"" Bobby answered, delivering the joke. The joke was on how the word gorilla sounded like a grill. Bobby's joke always left people in stitches.
Even though Bobby was popular and friendly, some school kids kept kidding him. Fat Bobby was the nickname bad guys gave Bobby. Every time Bobby heard the nickname, he would gladly answer, ""The sticks and the stones can break my bones, but the words can never hurt me."" The thugs would respond gracefully, ""I bet you'd eat those sticks and stones, fat Bobby!"" And run away running.
Bobby didn't let the idiot name bother him. I had more important things to think about, like what I was going to eat for dinner. Bobby knew one day he'd have to lose weight if he wanted to live a longer life. Until that day, Bobby would continue to eat what he wanted and loved so much.",A2
"Helen lit her flashlight. Nothing happened. The light didn't go on. There was no light. What was wrong with your flashlight? She unscrewed the top of the plastic flashlight. Helen pulled both batteries out of the plastic tube. He looked at both batteries. They were ""D"" batteries. They looked good. They didn't look bad. But maybe they were dead batteries. She opened a pack of new batteries. He put two new ""D"" batteries in the plastic tube. Helen bolted the top back into the plastic flashlight. He turned on his flashlight. The light worked!",A2
Nancy took her daughter Donna to the park. The park had many trees. He had a lot of squirrels and birds. Squirrels ran through the trees. The squirrels chased each other. Squirrels played with each other. The birds flew around. They flew to the ground. They flew into the trees. Squirrels and birds were good neighbors. Nancy sat on a bench. He took a magazine out of his purse. He passed the pages of the magazine. Donna ran to a squirrel. He tried to catch the squirrel. Then he tried to catch a bird. Donna chased the squirrels and the birds. Never caught a squirrel. He never took a bird. But he had a lot of fun.,A2
"Hot summer day, Jay and his friends were playing outside. The sun shone over Jay and his friends while kicking a football and the fourth. Football was Jay's favorite sport to play. Almost every day Jay invited his neighborhood friends to go out and play football on the street. Jay dreamed of one day being a professional football player. He imagined shooting a goal and listening to the roar of thousands of people cheering on his name throughout the football stadium. Jay knew it would take a lot of practice if he wanted to make his dream come true.

One day, as the sun went down the street where Jay and his friends used to play, an ice cream truck approached. As soon as Jay heard the music from the ice cream truck, he ran out of his house with two dollars in his hand. Jay looked around to see where the ice cream truck was. As soon as he saw him down the street, he stuck to him. Jay's friends had arrived first and were already asking the ice cream man for a cone of his favorite flavor of ice cream. This gave Jay time to think about what flavor to get. ""Should I have chocolate or vanilla?"" Jay asked himself. ""What's it gonna be, son?"" The ice cream man asked Jay when he realized he was the last guy standing without an ice cream cone. ""I will have Pistachio, please,"" Jay replied after some hesitations.
This summer had turned out to be the best so far for Jay. Tomorrow I'd play football one more time, and if the ice cream truck got close, I'd ask his parents for another two dollars. Jay didn't expect to start his school year in two weeks.",A2
"I'm so upset.
Oh, no. Tell me about it.
I can't enroll in a class I really need.
Is it full?
I have a hold on my file, because my library books were late.
Can't you pay the late fees?
I can't afford it. I'm totally ruined.
How much do you need?
I need $50.
Wow, you must have kept those books way beyond the expiration date.
Yeah, I know I'm awful.
I'll lend you the money.",A2
"It was Sunday, the last time I saw my dog. His name is Spot, because his whole body is covered with stains. He's a good dog. He never bites, and he hardly ever barks. I got Spot when I was about nine. All my friends knew Spot was my best friend. So, when I told everyone Spot was lost, they all came out trying to help. We searched for hours.

My father told me that maybe Spot was picked up by a dog hunter. If that were true, then it would be in the kennel, which is where they send all the dogs that get lost. My friend Mark told me they put pictures of all the dogs they find on the street online, so I went online to try. I spent over an hour checking the online photos of the dogs, and I finally found my Spot. I started jumping with joy.
I went with my parents to pick up Spot. When we got there, he started barking and running in circles around his cage. I knew he was happy to see us. He'd been missing for about two weeks. When we took him home, he ran down the backyard and ran straight to his little house that my father and I built for him. He started barking really hard, which is weird for Spot. As soon as my sister heard Spot, she ran out to try and catch him. He ran around her and then let himself be captured. I think he just wanted to be caressed. I knew she was happy to be back home and even happier when I brought her food. I hope Spot never gets lost again.

"His friends called him Hoss, as in Hoss Cartwright of the Bonanza television show. At 62 and about 380 pounds, Mark Rucker once looked like the big, friendly character.
Now, they call it The Beast.
The nickname is apt. Since February 2011, Rucker has run his first 5K, his first 10K, his first half marathon and his first marathon. He completed an Olympic triathlon away and lost more than 100 pounds. And on August 26, he will participate in his first Ironman competition in Louisville, Kentucky.
As they say, she's a beast.
What he does after this Ironman, I don't know, his wife, Annita Rucker, said with a laugh. I hope you can find something to focus all this energy on.
From Rucker's DailyMile blog: April 18, 2011 -- First day of the Couch to 5K program. That wasn't right. But at least I did all the training - LRB- 1.98 miles / 32 minutes / 16:10 step -RRB-
Change is a funny thing, Rucker says. Often, the desire to change grows over time. A series of events leads to a time when desire must meet with the right tools and the right inspiration.
In the summer of 2010, Rucker from Lexington, Kentucky, and his family went to Dollywood in Tennessee. His daughter was 11 years old at the time, a little reckless, and wanted to ride all the roller coasters. Unfortunately, Rucker couldn't fit into any of them with her.
“She was devastated; I was crushed,” Rucker said. But even that wasn't enough to start on the trip. I guess I didn't know how to do it.
Paternity makes us fat?
In January 2011, she reconnected with an old primary school friend, Anita Mills, and the two began talking on Facebook, discussing the weight loss of Mills240 pounds.
His transformation was his inspiration. But he wasn't ready to change yet.
After weighing about 365 pounds, he stopped stepping on the scale. He was diagnosed with sleep apnea and given high blood pressure medication. He was afraid of being diabetic, but he wasn't going to visit his doctor.
The day after Super Bowl 2011, Rucker woke up in pain. Once again, he had been pardoned too much the night before, and his digestive system rebelled. I was tired, sick and unhappy.
Something clicked, he said. I realized that if I kept doing so, I would significantly shorten my life.
Rucker took Millsdieting clues to heart and cut the sugary drinks. He dropped his two-litre-a-day soda habit and picked up water. He stopped ordering McDonald's McGriddles for breakfast and eating M&M peanuts for the pound. He threw his Cheez-Its.
It's hard to say what my daily intake - LRB- calories -RRB- was, he said, looking back. I did it to myself. I was very unhappy with the way my life was, and I think food was that comfort to me.
June 19, 2011 -- Last day of Couch 2 5K. I think I'll call it Father's Day Beastly 5K. I was the only competitor and ended up in the first place. I can't even begin to explain how I feel right now. And no one or nothing can take this away from me. I'm a runner. I'm a winner. I'm a Beast. Bridge 2 10K! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Rucker's work as a real estate lawyer kept him sedentary. So he started walking on his lunch break, using his iPhone to post his distance on DailyMile.com. The site shared its progress on Twitter and Facebook. Friends published responses that the site application read aloud to Rucker through his headphones during the workouts.
Wiring the World to Fight Obesity
That was a great reason for me, he said. Even though I was alone, I still had people cheering me up.
He ran his first official 5K race, the Great Buffalo Chase, on July 4, 2011, in 39 minutes. Less than a month later, he faced a 10K, ending up dead last but ending anyway. His blog that night complained about the cross-country course hills but promised to start training for a half-marathon the next day.
“The focus it has, the momentum it has... is so refreshing,” Annita Rucker said. He's the old Mark I didn't even know... probably the Mark of law school.
The Ruckers were married in October 2000. For 11 years, Annita Rucker saw the man she married -- the dreamer, the triumphant -- struggling to keep her optimism as she struggled with a shrinking housing market and a growing body.
Her son and daughter, two children from Rucker's first marriage, came to visit often, and Annita Rucker found herself entertaining the young children while her husband remained stationary.
I used to complain that I was living life on the sidelines, never participating, he said. Now, he's so active with them. Last year, my father had Parkinson's and was hospitalized for 10 weeks. Mark came up to the plate and made the whole kitchen, the laundry, everything. Before this, that would never have happened.
“My wife jokes, I have a new husband,” Rucker said with a long laugh. I think she's much happier with me... because I'm much happier.
August 18, 2011 -- Three miles walk at work on my lunch break. Some days I have to dig deep to find the motivation. Some days it's very difficult. Today is one of those days.
Rucker's training for his first Ironman competition. A typical week includes 4:30 a.m. swimming, 6 miles of after-work racing and cycling hours on Saturdays and Sundays. With 260 pounds, he stopped focusing on losing weight and began to focus on muscle building.
There are good and bad days. Some blog posts sing from serotonin running through her brain. Others show their discouragement from a bad bath or slow run. She's a beast, but one who feels pain.
Ironman Champion: The Importance of R&R
Still, it's amazing, even for him, that a guy who was shot down less than two years ago climbing a stretch of stairs can push himself here, so fast.
I'm the guy in the overall - LRB- who's -RRB- shoveling coal on the train, he said. I don't know exactly where he's going, but I'm gonna do everything I can to keep him moving.
February 18, 2012 -- Woot Woot!! I'm a marathoner! -LRB- 26.4 miles / 6 hours, 13 minutes / 14:07 step -RRB-
Rucker has returned to the social world. He volunteered at the Red Cross and participated in its local Rotary chapter. This year, his family returned to Dollywood and rode all walks together.
Rucker wants to become a motivational speaker, to be that inspiration to others that Mills was to him. Possible title for his speech: Be the Beast you can be.
When I was so overweight, I felt so dead for everything, Rucker said. There was a little voice in my head that said, for so long, this is the best your life is going to be.And that voice is gone. I've extinguished that voice.

"Friends make life easier, or at least they should. My best friend's name is Susan. I call her Suzy. Suzy and I always dated. Just to clarify, my name is Michael. Yeah, I'm a boy, and Susan's a girl. Everyone who knew us always thought we were in a relationship, but that was not the case. I loved Suzy like a sister, and she loved me like a brother. Well, I used to think he did.

It all started when Suzy got a boyfriend. I was happy for her, because I was sad and alone. Those were his words, not mine. When she introduced me to Richard, her boyfriend, I did my best to get along with him. Although I did my best, Richard didn't like it. Maybe his friends told him that Suzy and I were always out there, and they thought we were secretly in love with each other.
Richard got more and more jealous every time my name was mentioned. He started breaking up his relationship. Suzy started walking away from me. I called her, went to her house, or waited for her outside school, but she was always busy with Richard. She said, ""I'm sorry, Mike. I'll call you when I get home, okay?"" I knew it was a lie. Suzy and I haven't talked in a month. As she knew Suzy had always wanted to go to Las Vegas, so she was going to surprise Suzy by telling her she was going to take her. However, it seemed that the ship had sailed. Suzy and Richard were going to Vegas for their birthday.
I'm gonna move on, and I'm gonna hang out with other friends. It's not the same, but I guess anyone who chooses a relationship over a friendship was never a good friend to start with. However, I find myself questioning ""What are Friends?""",A2
"Chris knew that many of the other parents mocked him. I was pretty sure some of the mothers did, too. He was the president of the Father-Master Association at his daughter's school. He organized all sales of cakes, book sales and met with the school principal regularly to share the concerns he heard from other parents. That's not why the parents made fun of him. Other parents mocked him because this was all he did. Chris was a father who stayed home. His wife Maureen had a demanding full-time job working for an investment bank. She earned an excellent salary, but the job meant getting home early and late.

Rather focus on his daughter and what was going on in his school. He became the primary caregiver. Chris handled all the household duties. He took his daughter to school. He did all the shopping and cooked all the meals. He cleaned the house and helped his daughter with her homework. Everyone in the neighborhood called Chris ""Mr. Mom."" There were other names that Chris heard calling him, like ""home husband"" and ""home spouse.""
Chris didn't care about his role at all. He felt safe as a man. I didn't think a woman's house was in the house. He was glad that his wife loved his work and worked hard. He worked hard, too. He didn't get a salary like Maureen. He was happy to receive the love and appreciation of his family.
Sometimes Chris was lonely. When he took his daughter to the park, there were no other parents around. It felt strange talking to mothers. I didn't want them to think I was flirting with them or trying to pick them up.",A2
"It's been six months since Jason White's parents officially divorced. At first Jason was sad. He thought it was his fault his parents got divorced. One day, while Jason was in his father's new apartment, he asked his father a question. ""Why did you divorce Mom, Dad?"" Jason asked. Your father didn't want to talk about it. He told Jason he'd understand when he was older.

The next day, Jason came home to his mother. During the drive, he asked his mother the same question. ""Why did you divorce Dad, Mom?"" Jason asked. He told Jason what his father had told him. Jason didn't understand why they couldn't tell him the reason. I was ten, but I felt like I was still six. It had been a week since Jason asked his parents the question. Things didn't look so good for her parents. His mother cried, and his father was always angry.
Jason started to get mad at his parents. One day, after school, Jason decided to go to his friend Matt's house. He asked Matt if he could sleep for a couple of days. Matt said yes, so Jason went to get clothes from his house before his mother came home. Jason went back to Matt's. He told Matt not to tell Matt's mother and his mother that he was staying there. I didn't want anyone to know I was there. Matt agreed.
Around midnight, Jason's mother called Matt's mother to ask her if Jason had come. Since Matt didn't tell his mother, his mother said no. The next day, Jason saw that the police were looking for him. His mother and father had called the police. Matt started worrying because he didn't want to lie to the police. He called Jason's parents, and he told them Jason was at his house. When Jason's parents came to Matt's house, Jason wanted to go out the window. Matt told her that her parents were very worried and that she had to come back. His parents walked into Matt's room and saw Jason. They ran to him and hugged him. Jason's father turned to his ex-wife and gave him a big hug and a kiss. Jason was happy, but confused.",A2
"I was 10 when we received a computer. I didn't know what to do with it, so I just played video games on it. My brother was six years older than me, so he used the computer to get into chat rooms. After having had the computer for about a year, I realized that my brother would always be in chat rooms. He would always have an open private message too. It took me another year to realize that my brother was dating someone online.

I always met my brother's girlfriend as SnowBunny85, because she never officially told us she was his girlfriend. I later found out her name was Lily. My brother always tried to be careful not to leave any pictures that Lily sent him on the computer desk, but sometimes he would. She looked pretty. I didn't understand why my brother wanted to, or felt he needed to keep his relationship a secret.
A few years later, my brother told me he had broken up with a girlfriend he had. I asked him why, but he didn't want to talk about it. I heard what really happened one day while I was using the computer. My brother had kept his last conversation with Lily. It looked like Lily had lied to my brother. They had met a couple of times in real life, and they seemed to have had a real relationship. The only problem was Lily already had a husband. My brother was crushed to find out she was married. That day I realized that an online relationship is risky. It's up to you to find someone you can trust and I hope he doesn't lie to you. I hope my brother noticed, too.",A2
"Nancy Scott turned 21 last October. She was excited to finally be able to go to concerts that were strictly 21 and more. He decided he'd go to Vegas for his first concert. Nancy's sister Jennifer decided to go with her because she didn't want her sister to go alone and get lost. Jennifer called her friends Matt and Jake, and everyone decided to make the trip to Vegas.

When they arrived in Las Vegas, they parked their car in the parking lot of the hotel where they were staying. Nancy took a shower, and then Jennifer took one. They dressed and then met Matt and Jake in the lobby of the hotel. Nancy was so excited; she asked her sister if she wanted a drink. Jennifer agreed and said, ""Okay, but only one."" Jennifer bought her sister a giant drink that came in a four-foot-high cup, and she got the same. Nancy couldn't believe how big the drink was. ""He's almost as tall as I am,"" Nancy said. Jennifer laughed and had a drink of her glass.
Matt and Jake first came to the place where the concert was going to be. They called the sisters and told them where to find them. Nancy was excited to see the concert, because one of her favorite bands was playing. As they lined up to enter, Jennifer went to the bathroom. When Jennifer was returning to her friends and sister, she met one of the band members named Jill. Jennifer told Jill Nancy was coming all the way to Vegas to watch this show, and if I could do anything special for her. Jill smiled and said for sure.

"Many studies on language learning ask the question: What does a good language student do? There are some things good language students do and some things they don't do. These are some of the most useful suggestions of the studies.
Don't be afraid to make mistakes. People are often wrong. Good language students notice their mistakes and learn from them.
Do group activities. People use language to communicate with other people. A good language student always looks for opportunities to talk to other students.
Take notes during each class. The notes help you remember a new language. Look at your grades when you do your homework.
Use a dictionary. Good language students often use dictionaries to check the meaning of words they don't know. They also make their own vocabulary lists.
Think of the language you're learning outside the classroom. When shopping or walking down the street, remember useful words and phrases. Sometimes, when you're home, say new words to practice your pronunciation.
Do extra practice. Test and improve your language, reading and listening skills with self-study material. You can find a lot of this online.
Imagine speaking in the language. Many good language students can see and hear themselves speaking in the language. This helps your motivation.
Enjoy the process. Good language students have fun with the language. Watch a TV series or movie, listen to songs, play video games, or read a book. It's never too late to be a good language learner.",A2

"One of the best moments of a young man's life is the day he begins to learn how to drive. Learning to drive is a rite of passage. It is one of the steps that young people take to become adults. This is a wonderful time full of excitement and expectations. One of the most attractive things to learn to drive is the freedom that comes from the operation of a vehicle.

Once people are able to drive a vehicle, they can go anywhere in the city and beyond. In Southern California, the region was planned and built in a scattered way with miles and miles of access to the highway. A new driver no longer needs to rely on others to go somewhere. Now he or she is free to go out on his own.
When Michael Allen learned how to drive, he was very excited. He was 16, which in California means he can get a driver's license. After six months with a permit, I could have a driver's license. Michael had been bothering his father to teach him how to drive for months and now the big day came. His father Edward was a great strong man, who insisted on teaching Michael in a standard transmission car. That meant Michael had to learn how to operate a clutch and a gear change, which is not easy.
They both started their lessons. Edward was a difficult taskmaster, and Michael was having great difficulties at first. ""Let the clutch out slowly,"" Edward started screaming every time Michael didn't do it right. ""Relax it. You can do it,"" Edward told his son. ""I'm trying, Dad. I'm trying,"" Michael said. It wasn't nice at first, but soon Michael was going up and down the block. He was very happy, and so was his father. Michael was now a driver.",A2

"One day Abel opened his refrigerator and gasped when he realized there was nothing there. ""Who ate all the food?"" Abel asked his brother Mel, who was in the living room sitting on the sofa watching cartoons. ""You probably woke up in the middle of the night and ate it all!"" Mel responded with humor. Abel didn't have fun. His stomach snarled and he didn't have time for Mel's childish jokes. ""I'm so hungry! I could eat a horse!"" Abel proclaimed. ""I bet you can easily eat two,"" Mel joked. ""You are so funny,"" Abel replied sarcastically.

Abel thought about ordering a pepperoni pizza on the phone, but soon he realized he only had five dollars. I needed ten bucks to make the purchase. He was five bucks short. Abel asked his brother if he could help for the rest, but he had no money. ""Are you hungry?"" Abel asked Mel. ""I ate,"" Mel said. This made Abel jealous and a little angry. ""What did you eat?"" Abel asked, with her eyebrows swirled. ""A ten-dollar pizza,"" Mel casually replied. ""You must be joking,"" Abel said, almost screaming. Mel just sat there watching a recording of an episode of The Simpsons.
""When will Mom be back?"" Abel asked Mel. ""I don't know,"" he replied. Abel now could only expect his mother to come to the rescue and bring a large fresh pizza from Pizza Mountain. Abel fell next to Mel on the couch and started watching TV with him. They both laughed out loud at the funny characters in the cartoon. Abel was enjoying himself so much that he had forgotten that he was hungry. Then they started playing the ads. Abel's stomach started ordering food again. ""I will starve to death,"" Abel said, when the front door of his house began to open. ""I'm back and I've brought pizza!"" Abel's mother said when she came in through the door. Abel couldn't wait to put his hands on the pizza.",A2

"Adrian loves to collect vinyl records. He got his first record from his grandfather. It was a Louis Armstrong record. His grandfather even gave him a record player to play his records. The only thing Adrian didn't like was that he lived in a small town, so there were no stores selling records. His brother told him to look for Craigslist.

Adrian searched Craigslist for people who sold records of his favorite bands. He had to look for vendors in the nearest city, and he found one. His brother went to town every week. Adrian asked his brother if he could go with him next time. Your brother said yes. The person you found was selling his entire record collection for $200. Adrian was excited and took out the money he'd been saving. Adrian's brother told him that he had read about bad things happening to people about Craigslist.
They e-mailed the guy who sold the records and told him to meet at a Starbucks. When Adrian and his brother got there, they saw the guy outside the Starbucks drinking coffee. He had a record box with him. The guy told him it wasn't really his collection; it belonged to his brother who had passed away. He wanted to sell it to someone who appreciated them and listened to them every day, as his brother had done. Adrian said he'd play one record a day.

"Steven Baker loves his car. He owns a beautiful Chevrolet Corvette 1977 that he bought many years ago. Steve, as he's known to his friends, has a lot in the car. He bought it from a guy who was the original owner. This is the best possible situation a buyer of used cars can find. Car culture in California is unique. Detroit car manufacturers look for trends in California to include in their car designs. Many people in California like lower cars, which make them look more elegant and agile. This comes from the practice of sailing the boulevard, an activity that is very popular among people of all ages, especially in Southern California.

It was Saturday night in August. Steve called me to see what he was doing that night. ""Let's sail, brother,"" Steve said. And of course I said yes. I loved sailing in his car. Girls loved that car. It was a two-seater with a T-roof that's removable. That night we sailed along Van Nuys Blvd., a popular street where many young people like to sail. This is where boys can meet girls and vice versa. It wasn't long before we saw a car full of girls in an old Ford Thunderbird. ""Hey!"" I yelled at the girls when we got close to them. ""Does anyone want to sail with us?"" I said, and to my surprise a couple of young blondes jumped and left. It was a tight fit, but the girls were small and thin. I was in heaven! In a short time, I was dating one of them, and Steve was dating the other.
We went to a few double dates after that, but Steve and his parents moved in a year later and I never heard from him again. That was a sad day in my life, but at least I had a new girlfriend, thanks to him and his 1977 Corvette!",A2
"Once upon a time there was a little doll alive. He lived inside a dollhouse that was on the corner of a girl's room. The doll's name was Jane, and the girl's name was Diana. Diana and Jane were best friends. Nobody else knows Jane can talk and breathe like anyone else. It was a secret between Jane and Diana.

Jane and Diana played together every day. Sometimes they played inside the dollhouse. They liked watching movies, playing hide-and-seek and painting. They also liked playing outside with toy cars and drawing with chalk on the floor. Since Diana was too big and Jane too small, they couldn't play hide and seek and run over long distances. Instead, they enjoyed playing their own version of hiding. When they played, it had to be inside a small room. Jane was always the one who hid, as it was easy for her to do so.
One day, it was Diana's birthday, and she had several classmates from the school who came to celebrate. Jane remained hidden in plain sight in Diana's room. At one point, things got tough between some of the boys and girls, and they started chasing each other around the house. Then some of them entered Diana's room and began to invade her things. One of the boys got Jane who was at his dollhouse and started throwing and playing catch with her among the guys.

""Get out!"" Diana screamed. After they all left, Diana picked Jane up and asked her if she was okay. Diana was happy to see Jane was in one piece. It would be the last time Diana would bring anyone to play. This secret was too big to risk his discovery. No one could know Jane the living doll.",A2
"When I was 13, I loved playing drums. I guess hitting the drums gave me an emotional exit for a very troubled moment in my youth. When you're 13, everything seems to come to you from all directions. The drums helped me cope with being a teenager. One day, I called my friend Rudy on the phone. Rudy loved playing with his guitar. None of us had taken music lessons, but we loved our instruments. ""Hey, Rudy, why don't you come over? We can play for a while,"" I suggested. ""No problem, man. If that's all right with you, I'll bring my cousin Bobby with me. Play bass."" I told him it would be great and I waited for them to arrive.

Bobby didn't just play bass, he got stuck. ""You're really rock on that bass, Bobby,"" I said. He said he had been playing for years and wanted to form a band. We all looked at each other, and it struck us like lightning. ""We can do this!"" Rudy and I said at the same time. ""All we need is a vocalist,"" I said, to what Bobby resounded, ""I can do that too!"" That was the start of the best rock band ‘N’ Roll – “The Coke Bottles”. Of course it was an exaggeration, but it turned out we were pretty good at a bunch of novices.
The three of us started meeting at my house every week to practice playing together and bouncing song ideas off each other. Bobby could really sing. With Rudy and I putting on all those practice hours, we got pretty good. We got so good that we played at a couple of parties and at a free concert at the park festival about a year later. That was as far as we got. Rudy joined the army the following year. Bobby and I were never able to find another lead guitarist, so the best rock band ‘N’ Roll “The Coke Bottles” never made it big, but that was good for me. We had our day in the sun.",A2
"Phil grew up in a very poor family in a very poor city. It was pretty bad. Sometimes Phil and his sisters didn't have enough to eat and went to bed hungry. That was good with Phil because that was his life, and he thought it was the way everyone in the world lived.

Phil had a lot of fun and had a lot of friends. It wasn't until Phil was about 12 years old that he began to realize there were better things in the world. Phil and his best friend Albert sat down and talked about getting out of this place to see the world. It was a fantasy, but it was a good fantasy. They didn't really know how they'd do it, but they had a dream. Then one day Phil's cousin, Ralphie, came to visit me.
Phil didn't know Ralphie very well. Ralphie grew up in Texas and was about 8 years older than Phil. It had been years since Phil saw his cousin. That day Ralphie changed Phil's life. Ralphie broke into the house in his Marine Corp uniform, and Phil knew at the time that he wanted to become a marine.
Phil and Ralphie talked all night. Ralphie told him everything about the Corporation and Phil was fascinated. Ralphie wore his medals and awards, and his uniform was so clean and clean that Phil wanted to join at the time. Five years later, Phil joined the Marines. He was 17 years old and needed his mother's permission. His mother said, ""Where do I sign?"" Of course I was kidding, but I knew Phil was gonna do this. It was her way out of this place, so she gave her blessings. The day Phil left, he promised his mother he'd come back. He kept his promise. He returned several times over the years, and helped his family as much as he could.",A2

"Maria received a Facebook notification on her mobile phone, which says, ""You have a new message from Jimmy."" Maria didn't know any Jimmy except an ex-boyfriend ten years ago. Mary opened the message and I'm sure it was from the man she dated a long time ago.

""You should Google me and see what I've been doing,"" the message said. Maria thought the message was strange, but out of curiosity, she wrote Jimmy's full name on Google's search bar. He saw photos of him and several articles. The articles dealt with him who filed for divorce from his wife who was a high school teacher in New York City. She had been accused of having an affair with one of her students. He had been fired and faced criminal charges. I had a daughter with Jimmy, a successful lawyer.
""Did it blow your mind?"" Jimmy wrote in a separate Facebook post after a while. Mary didn't know if I should answer. Why did you approach her after all these years? He wanted me to know that he was divorced so they could get out again? Maria decided to play the game. ""Yes, my mind is blown, and I hope things have been fixed for you and your daughter,"" Maria wrote. Jimmy didn't answer that night. Maria thought it would be the last time she heard from Jimmy.
A week later Maria received another notification on Facebook. It was another message from Jimmy. ""I was hoping you'd have time on your busy schedule to see me,"" he read the message. Maria hesitated. When they stopped dating years ago, it was because Jimmy had written him a cruel message. Should I give him another chance?",A2
"María González didn't like how technology was slowly taking over everyone's life. He always took the bus to school. Every time I got on the bus, I noticed more than half the people were looking at their phones. Fewer people were having real conversations with each other. It felt bad. He thought that was why people had trouble relating to people in the real world. Everyone was living online now.

Maria had trouble making new friends because she hated being on social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. He rarely met new people. She tried to go with people on the bus and start a conversation, but they always looked at her strangely. She felt like she was a stranger, and the only one who wasn't trapped in the web of Internet lies.
One day, while Mary was walking through the park, she saw a girl walking through the park. The girl wore a long, colorful dress, and she always smiled. Maria wanted to talk to this girl. He came up to the girl and said hi. At first the girl got scared, because she didn't see Mary coming, but then she smiled and said, ""Hello. Do we know each other?"" Mary shook her head and said no. Maria asked him if he wanted to hang out and talk. The girl said yes. Maria and the girl talked for hours. They talked about everything: music, kids, family, food, and their shared distrust of technology. Mary had done something she hadn't done since she was a child: she made a new friend in the real world.",A2
"Riding on the bus is as easy as cake. The bus driver is there to answer any questions passengers may have. And it only costs a dollar and fifty cents. These were the things Valery had heard from all her friends about public transportation. I've never been alone on the bus before. This was about to change in fifteen minutes while I was waiting at the bus stop on the corner of Atlantic Avenue and 61th Street. Valery had just turned fifteen and was ready to start riding the bus on her own.

Valery's mother had sent her to Grandma's house for a weekend stay. She had packed all her belongings in a backpack, and was dressed in her lucky suit in case she crossed any black cat. He was headed for the city of Montebello, where his grandmother lived. His heart began to accelerate when he saw bus number 260 approaching in the distance. She looked around to see if she was alone, but there was no one else waiting for the bus. I was alone.
""Come on, you can do this,"" Valery said. She recalled that she and her mother had taken the same bus to her grandmother's house dozens of times. ""It's like before, except Mom's not here,"" Valery said, trying to calm down. The bus finally stopped at its stop, and its doors opened in front of Valery. He breathed deeply, looked at the bus driver and entered.
Valery put the money in the slot and waved to the bus driver. He then headed to the back of the bus and quickly sat next to an old woman. The scariest part was over. ""Now all I have to do is sit back and wait until I reach my destination,"" Valery said to herself. ""Don't forget to pull the rope,"" a familiar voice said in his head.",A2

"Eddie loved playing guitar. His favorite type of music to play and listen to was Rock and Roll. Eddie had been playing guitar since the age of thirteen. He had an older brother who also played guitar. It was his older brother who first taught him how to play guitar. Eddie, now seventeen, aspired to be a famous musician one day. He knew he couldn't do this on his own, so he started a talent hunt for someone to play with him.

One day Eddie met another guitarist named Jake. Jake was the same age as Eddie. Both Eddie and Jake shared a similar taste in music. When Eddie asked Jake if he'd like to form a band, Jake said yes. ""What's our band's name?"" Jake asked. Eddie hadn't thought of a name for the band yet. ""I'm open to any suggestions you might have,"" Eddie told Jake. The next day, Jake thought of a perfect name. Eddie liked the name as soon as he heard it. Since then, the name of Eddie and Jake's band was Jetsam.
Eddie and Jake started learning to play songs on their guitars together. Although both listened to a variety of rock bands, they focused mainly on learning songs from their favorite ensemble: The Beatles. Almost everyone loved the Beatles. Learning to sing and play their songs seemed the best I could do.
After learning a bunch of songs, Eddie and Jake felt ready to perform in front of an audience. Eddie and Jake got their acoustic guitars and performed on an open music night at the local community center. The audience roared with loud applause after the Jetsam set ended. Eddie and Jake bowed and thanked the audience for coming.

Jennifer loved to go bowling every Tuesday night. He always liked bowling, but he had never joined a bowling league until his friend Paul told him about a new league one day. The two friends enjoyed going to Lucky Lanes on weekends, but had to wait for the league games to end before they could bowl. They didn't mind since they knew when the league games were over.

""Don't you have to be a good bowling player in a league?"" Paul thought about it for a while before returning to the manager to ask if the new league was for good bowling, or anyone could join.
The manager told him that this new league was for beginners, adding that Paul and Jennifer would be some of the best players in the new league. Paul was very excited once again. When he told Jennifer what the manager had said, Jennifer's answer was, ""Where do I register?"" This made Paul very happy.

"Learning another language is a difficult but not impossible task. Andrew knew the challenge ahead, but he was determined to achieve his goal of learning Spanish. Andrew wanted to learn Spanish because his girlfriend's family was from Guatemala. Andrew had already learned some basic words. Yes in Spanish it was yes, it wasn't no, and thank you it was thank you. It was only a matter of time before he became fluid and started talking to his girlfriend's relatives.

Andrew had been receiving lessons from his neighbor next door, Joseph. José spoke fluently both Spanish and English. He was born in Mexico and emigrated to the United States at the age of ten.

"Ken and Anthony were childhood friends. They went to elementary and high school together. They went to college in different states, and then lost touch. That was 20 years ago.

One morning Ken was reading the paper with his morning coffee. Inside he saw an announcement of a poetry reading in a nearby bookstore. He was surprised to discover that the prominent poet was none other than his friend Anthony. Ken decided to see what his old friend was doing.
Ken sat in the last row of the area installed inside the bookstore. When Anthony was introduced to the podium, Ken barely recognized him. Anthony was almost completely bald and had a little belly. When Anthony was in high school, he was very handsome. What Anthony had lost in looks made up for in talent. Anthony's poetry was pretty good.

Attachment: doctor's_certificate.pdf
Dear Professor Hart,
I'm writing to let you know that I can't attend class for two weeks, as I've had an accident and I've hurt my back. I'm afraid I also need to ask for an extension for next week's rehearsal.
I have pain medication, but I can't get up or walk much, and the doctor told me I should stay in bed and rest as much as possible. This makes reading and studying very difficult for me right now. I have attached a copy of the medical certificate and hope to be back in class since May 12.
Until then, my friend is going to record the lectures so I can hear them at home. I'll try to catch up on the whole reading as well. However, I do not think I can present the essay next week. Is it possible to have an extension?
Thank you for your understanding.

"Mildred went to pick up his son Bill from school one afternoon. When he got to school, Mildred noticed Bill seemed upset. I was pouting and I didn't want to look at her. ""What's going on?"" She asked him. ""I got into trouble,"" Bill said quietly. ""What happened?"" Mildred asked softly. ""They gave me time out to grab a Mary's toy,"" Bill said.

Mildred wasn't sure what a time out was. She knew that times were called in sports every time a player was hurt, but she wasn't sure how it would be used in a kindergarten classroom. Mildred was sure that his son grabbing a toy from a classmate was not right. The next day, when Mildred took Bill to school, he stopped the teacher. He asked the teacher to explain what time it was. Mildred told the teacher that Bill was very upset about the time he spent the day before. The teacher explained that time was a disciplinary tool she used in the classroom. When he saw Bill grab Mary's toy, he told him to leave. Outside time is a chair next to the teacher's desk where a student has to sit quietly when they do something wrong.
""They are not expelled from the classroom, simply removed from the immediate situation in order to reflect on what they did wrong,"" the teacher explained. Mildred thought it was an interesting way to teach young children self-control. ""Can I use this at home?"" Mildred asked the teacher. ""Of course!"" The professor said.
Later that night, Mildred had an argument with her husband about something. In the middle of the discussion she hit her hand on the kitchen counter. ""Mom, you need some time out,"" Bill said.",A2

"I've gained so much weight because my college dining room is all you can eat.
It's called ""Frestman 15.""
What exactly is that?
It is an expression to refer to the observation that many freshmen gain weight.
Oh, I see. I definitely got the freshman 15 then.
You should use your college gym.
I never have time.
Please! You just have to make time.
I guess I should set an hour for it to work.
That's the attitude I like to hear!
Did you gain weight?
Yeah, I just wear big clothes to hide my fat.",A2
"
Ron was excited to show his wife Debbie what he had bought at the home improvement store. Debbie, however, was not impressed when she saw the big black plastic cube. He thought it was a trash can. ""We already have a trash can. Why did you get another one?"" Debbie asked. She seemed upset.

Ron explained it wasn't a trash can. It was a compost bucket. Ron explained that a compost bucket was a place where they could put any organic waste, such as fallen leaves, grass cuts, and fruit and vegetable shells. ""Why can't we just throw that away?"" Debbie asked. She really didn't want extra work for herself. ` Ron explained that it was good for the environment. About 30% of all garbage in the United States is made up of food waste and patios. Not only would they produce less garbage, but they would also make compost, which was rich land. I'd help Debbie's flowers. He could have the beautiful garden he always dreamed of. Ron explained that little by little inside the trash can, food remains and green waste would create a pile. The pile would naturally break.
""Where do we keep this pile?"" Debbie asked. Ron said the trash can would go to the backyard. Debbie wasn't convinced. I was worried about rats and cockroaches. Ron explained that as long as they didn't put leftovers of meat or oily items in the compost tank, rats wouldn't be a problem. However, cockroaches were a natural part of the decomposing materials.
Ron was especially excited about what he bought to put in the compost bin. He took out a small box and gave it to Debbie. He opened it and screamed before throwing the box down. The box was full of worms.",A2
"""Can I ride my horse, Mom?"" Sara asked her mother. Sara loved riding. She rode her horse almost every Saturday. ""Okay, honey, get ready to go,"" her mom said. Sara was happy. He went into his room. He put on his pink socks. He put on his pink slippers. He grabbed his pink hat. He went to the front door. ""I'll wait in the car,"" he told his mom.

"""My dad will take us to Santa Monica today,"" Carol said. ""Do you want to go with us?"" Laura loved going to the beach, so she said she'd be happy to do it. Santa Monica Beach is one of the most beautiful beaches in California. There are more panoramic views of the coast up and down the state, but many are inaccessible to those going to the beach. Santa Monica has a very large beach area that has white sand and plenty of space to play. Carol liked to throw a Frisbee with her friends and play volleyball.

""You want to play volleyball, Laura,"" Carol asked when they arrived. ""Sure,"" said Laura, ""but who are we going to play with? It takes more than two people to play."" Carol thought about it, and said they should start playing and others will join, so the two girls started playing alone. As Carol said, more children came and wanted to play with them. Soon they had more than enough people for a game, and they played for hours.
After the game, the girls wanted to cool off, so they decided to jump into the ocean for a little relief. The water was crowded, but that only added to the fun. It was cool and wet, and the waves were fine. Some people were surfing both surfboards and bodyboards, while others were swimming to buoys. On the coast, two girls were digging for seashells and one man was using his metal detector to find hidden treasures. Carol ran to the man and asked him what he was looking for. He said, ""Everything I can find, young lady."" Carol laughed and asked him if he could try. ""Sure. Why not?"" The man said. So Carol started scanning the beach and soon found a necklace, which the man let her keep. ""Why not,"" the man said. ""You found it."" Carol was very happy and ran to tell Laura.",A2

"James Baker was only 12 when his parents decided to move the family to a new city. At first James had a broken heart, because he had to leave his friends behind. His mother told James that he would be fine, and that he would make new friends.

When James and his family finally came to their new home, they decided to go out and meet the neighbors. It was a typical American suburban neighborhood. Each house had a large lawn on the front with a walkway leading to the door. James was uncomfortable, and he didn't want to meet the neighbors. The first house they went to belonged to a couple of elders. They seemed nice, but they didn't have children James's age. The next house they visited had bicycles parked by the garage door, so James thought children his age could live there. James knocked on the door, and a young woman named Linda answered. James got nervous, and he let his mother talk. Linda's parents weren't home, but she told James' mother they'd visit when they got home. Linda smiled at James, said goodbye and closed the door.
As they walked back to their next house, James looked back and noticed Linda looking out the window. James looked at her, and Linda smiled. When they got home, James went to his new room. She looked outside her window, and noticed that she could see Linda in her room. He couldn't help but look at her. She thought she was the prettiest girl I'd ever seen. While James was looking at her, he heard his mother calling. ""I'll be down in a moment, Mom,"" James said as he walked away from the window. When James looked at Linda again, she stared at him. James fell to the ground, and said in a whisper, ""Oh, no. I hope you didn't see me. Oh, please. Please."" Linda saw him and laughed. She thought James was cute.",A2
"My older brother James has always been a good baseball player. He's six years older than me, but he always invites me to play ball with him. It's one of my favorite things. We live next to a park. Every time we get bored we cross the street and start throwing the ball. Last time we went to the park, we were playing catch and also hitting some baseballs with our bats. Some guys came up to us because they wanted to play baseball. They needed two more players, so they asked us to play with them.

James asked me if I wanted to play, and I said yes. The guy's name was Christian, and he introduced us to all the boys. James introduced me and gave him our names. I asked Christian if he could play catcher. I always liked playing receiver at school. He said I could and James got the first base. During the game, James got a homerun and I was excited for him. I got on the base twice, but I went out all the time. I was sad, but James told me not to worry and that would happen.
After the game, Christian and the boys told James if he wanted to go have a drink with them. I thought James was going because he likes to drink, but he told them he was going to take me to lunch. We thanked them for the game and Christian asked James for his phone number in case they ever needed more players for a game. James gave it to him and then we went to eat Jim's Burgers.
I asked James why he wouldn't drink with the boys. He told me he knew his responsibilities. I didn't know what I meant, but I was glad it wasn't. Now, we could eat burgers and fries.",A2

"Sam was so proud of himself. It had been two years without smoking a cigarette. At the age of 14, Sam was already inflating his favorite brand of cigarettes, Marlboro. Even though people have to be over 18 years old in the United States to buy cigarettes, Sam knew about some shops selling cigarettes without checking identification. Sam had spent seven years smoking, he was 21 when he decided to quit.

Sam decided to quit after finding out he'd been coughing blood. He got tired quickly, and noticed his teeth getting very yellow. Whenever Sam was hanging out with his smoking friends, he always wanted a really bad cigarette, but he was always strong and said no when he was offered one. Before Sam quit, I went through a pack of cigarettes a week. The pack of cigarettes usually costs you $5.25.
As a way to encourage yourself to quit smoking, Sam decided to save his money every week. After two years, Sam took out all his money he had saved from not smoking, and saw that he had saved $504. He decided to buy a bike so he could ride it for fun and exercise. When he started riding a bicycle more often, he realized that he was no longer thinking about smoking. He didn't want a cigarette when he was dating his smoking friends.
Sam rode a bike in the morning because he loved to take a breath of fresh air. In the past, when I smoked, the only time I had a breath of fresh air was when I went out to smoke a cigarette. He enjoyed being outside breathing the air hitting his face as he rode on a bicycle through the city.",A2

"There's a saying, ""A man's garbage is another man's treasure,"" which means I might not like something and throw it away, and then someone could love it and take it. I remember seeing a bum looking for trash looking for something he could sell. I asked him why he did it. He looked at me and said, ""A man's garbage is another man's treasure,"" which he didn't understand at the time.

In fact, he was collecting things he needed not only to sell, but things he needed to make his house. This man lived in the park next to my house. No one really bothered him because he was respectful and cleaned up after himself. One day I ran to the park and saw him putting together a bed with things he had collected from the trash. He was always looking for clean things. If I had food trash, I wouldn't take it. I went back to my car and brought him a blanket. He saw it and thanked me.
I remember one day the police were bothering him because they had to take his stuff away. The members of the neighborhood went to the police and told them that they were not hurting anyone for being there. The vagabond looked at everyone and thanked them, but told the police to take his house if they had to. ""I know they're just doing their job. Go ahead,"" he said.
When the police heard him say that, they decided to leave him alone. He's been there for a couple of years. He's even started planting a garden outside the football field. People often go and give you food and other items you might need. He's turned garbage into his treasure.",A2
"Sharon and Ken just finished a wonderful meal at a fancy restaurant. The service and food were of five stars quality. Ken asked for the check. ""How much does the tip cost?"" Sharon asked. Since she and Ken were just friends, she didn't want him to pay for all the food, but since Ken invited her, she assumed he was paying. Sharon thought the offer to put on the tip was a good gesture. The tip wasn't gonna be cheap. The food, complete with a bottle of wine, must have been at least $200. $30 would be 15 percent of a $200 bill, and $40 would be 20 percent of a $200 check. Since the service was good, Sharon had no problem giving a 20 percent tip.

Ken told Sharon there was no need to leave a tip. Sharon was shocked. Maybe Ken didn't think the food was good or maybe he wasn't happy with the service. This surprised Sharon because Ken seemed to enjoy the whole experience and did not complain. ""Is something wrong?"" Sharon asked Ken. ""No,"" Ken replied. He explained that he felt tipping was just an American way of showing extra wealth. ""I think it's vulgar and disrespectful,"" he continued.
Sharon knew Ken was not born in the United States and wondered if that had anything to do with how Ken felt. ""Well, in the United States, some tip is expected. Servers are generally not paid so well and rely on advice to feed their families. The exception, of course, is if the service was really bad, but I had a great time. Isn't that right?"" Sharon asked. ""The service was great,"" Ken agreed, ""but why don't you pay the servers better so we don't have to pay more?"" Sharon agreed with Ken, but still left a 20 percent tip.",A2

"Patricia was happy that she was finally making friends since she moved to Los Angeles from New York. She had left everything behind to be closer to her boyfriend. The first friend he made was Helen. Helen worked with Patricia at a clothing store at the local mall. Sometimes Patricia even saw Helen on the highway when they were working the same shift. Patricia thought they shouldn't live too far from each other. Helen confirmed this.

""My neighborhood is right next to yours,"" Helen told Patricia while they were both checking out the clients. ""It happens whenever you want on a day when we're both not working,"" Helen said. Patricia took the invitation too literally. She was able to get Helen's address from her manager at work. ""I want to surprise my new friend,"" Patricia told the manager. The manager thought it was sweet and without thinking about Helen's privacy, he passed the address to Patricia. On a day when Patricia and Helen had the day off, Patricia searched Helen's address on her map app on her cell phone. Helen's house was only 10 minutes away.
Patricia followed the signs, and at 9:00 a.m., she rang the bell on 2374 Evergreen Avenue. It took Helen a while to open the door. She seemed really surprised, but also confused when she saw Patricia at her door. ""What are you doing here? How did you get my address?"" Helen asked. He was still in his pajamas and his hair was a mess. ""You told me to come when we had a day off, so I got your address from our manager. I want to surprise you!"" Patricia said.

"Jaime, a new immigrant, was attending his daughter's first performance in a school play. Her daughter, Carol, was five years old. She was a kindergarten student at the local public school. Carol didn't have a very important role in the school play. I was touching a cloud of rain in a play on drought in California. Carol had a line. His phrase was, ""I'm sad enough to cry about how dry the state is.""

Jaime and his wife made sure to arrive early so they could get a good seat in the auditorium. They secured seats in the front row. Before the show began, the school principal gave an introductory speech. The speech was about how hard the students and teachers worked together to make the work possible. At the end of the speech, the director said, ""Let's give the school staff a hand.""
Jaime, whose English was not very good, stood up when the director said this. I knew that when people said ""give someone a hand"" they meant they needed help. Jaime always wanted to help, especially at his daughter's school. Jaime thought maybe they needed help behind the scenes.
Jaime's wife put her arm in front of her husband. ""Where are you going?"" She whispered. ""They need a hand,"" Jaime whispered. His wife explained that ""give someone a hand"" could also mean applauding someone. ""They don't need help. They just want us to applaud,"" said Jaime's wife. Jaime felt a little embarrassed. He sat down again and began to applaud along with the rest of the audience.
Jaime thought to himself that someone needed to give a hand to the English language. How could a phrase mean two different things? I meant that the English language needed help.",A2
"That's how Josh met his first girlfriend. I was 12 and I was in seventh grade. I'd known Diana since she was a kid, but she was shy and never talked to her. She was very pretty, and Josh was afraid to tell her something because he thought he wouldn't like it. Josh had no confidence in himself when he was a kid. She finally had the courage to talk to her one day in April.

The school was right on a busy street, so a crossing guard helped the students cross over to the other side. The guard was carrying a sign over his head that said ""Stop"" so that the cars wouldn't hit anyone. The rule was that no one could cross the street without the guard, so everyone always waited. One day Josh came to the corner and the crossing guard was gone, so he decided to cross the street alone. That's when he heard ""Hey! You're not supposed to cross the street alone!"" He was the crossing guard. Josh didn't see him because the guard was behind a bush tying his shoes. Josh was so scared. From that day on, he decided to turn the block to avoid seeing the guard. I knew the guard would report it to the school.
What happened next was something I couldn't believe. It turned out that Diana also went around the block, but Josh didn't know then. One day she accidentally met her and started talking. One thing led to another, and soon Josh was looking forward to going home the long way. They started walking together and Josh found out that Diana was as shy as he was. They walked and talked every day and started to like each other. Soon they began to tell everyone that they were boyfriend and girlfriend.

Now that I was out of high school, he came back specifically to tell me about my plans. I had no idea he was coming because he wanted it to be a surprise, and I'm sure he was.
""Well, now that you're out of high school, what are you going to do with your life?"" He asked. To tell you the truth, I had no idea. Most of my classmates knew exactly where they wanted to go to college, or whether they were going to join the army. Some of them were like me – no clues. No one had interested me enough to try to give me any guidance except Eddie. He told me about the university and should consider going to a community university since he had not applied for a four-year university. I was very interested, but confused. ""You never went to college, Eddie. How do you know it's the right thing to do?"" I asked. Eddie smiled and said he knew and needed to trust him on this.
Since I trusted him as a brother, I followed his advice and enrolled in a community college. It's been a great experience. I must admit, Eddie was right. I'm transferring to UCLA next semester and things are looking for me. I owe it all to my big brother Eddie.

"Robert Garcia always wanted to play baseball. He was small and weak, but he loved playing the game. Robert told his father that he wanted to play baseball, but he felt that he was too weak to enter the school baseball team. Robert's father looked at him and said, ""Son, strength doesn't come from the muscles. You never know what you can do until you try. Get out there and try it. You have to risk it.""

Robert was inspired. He went to the tests at school the next day. Although Robert was the smallest person in the evidence, he did not give up.

"Michelle was tired after a long day at work. I just wanted to get home, order a pizza for dinner, and go to bed. As he sat on the train home, he closed his eyes. Suddenly he heard music. It was a harmonica playing a sad song. It sounded like a blues song. He opened his eyes to see where the sound came from. Was it from someone's iPod with the volume high?

The sound came from a man leaning against the doors of the subway playing a harmonica. When he finished playing the song, he went up and down the halls with a cup in his hand asking for tips. Michelle didn't feel this was fair. Although the music was not unpleasant, I had no choice. She was forced to listen as she had to take the train home from work. Now you were asking to be paid by the people who were forced to listen? I had something of value. Michelle didn't give him any money. Some of his fellow travelers dropped coins in the man’s cup.
""You shouldn't encourage that,"" Michelle told one of her traveling companions after she dropped a little change in the man's cup. ""I don't even think it's legal for him to play music on the train and ask for money,"" Michelle said. He then scanned the ads and notices inside the train car. Of course he found a sign that music was not allowed to play and apply and that there would be a fine for people trapped by the police.
When the harmonica passed through Michelle and extended her glass so that she could put some change, she pointed to the signal. The harmonica shrugged. ""We all have to make a living, ma'am,"" he said.",A2

I knew things weren't gonna be the same if he left Riverdale, California.

""Why do we have to move?"" Jerry would ask, sounding depressed. His parents had already answered that question countless times. Despite knowing the answer, Jerry was reluctant to believe it, so he kept asking. ""Why do we have to move?"" Jerry asked over and over again. The simple truth was that Jerry and his family could no longer afford to live in Riverdale. It was hard for Jerry to accept that truth.
The day before the move, Jerry walked the known places in Riverdale. I was walking past the oak where he kissed a girl for the first time. He went through the mini-market on the corner where he brought milk every Sunday. He went through his high school where he had learned and discovered his love for mathematics and science.
Jerry knocked on the doors of friends' houses to say one last goodbye. ""Goodbye, Tom,"" Jerry told his best friend. ""Bye Jane,"" Jerry told his girlfriend. The night fell when Jerry finally finished saying goodbye to everyone he knew. ""Goodbye, Riverdale,"" Jerry said, looking out the window of his room as he fell asleep. That night, Jerry dreamed of moving to Arizona and making friends the first day there. Everything in Arizona seemed great in his dream. The next morning, when he woke up, Jerry didn't feel so bad about moving. ""Everything will be fine,"" Jerry said as he entered the moving van on his way to Arizona.",A2
"I'm sick of the dining room food.
Me too! It's so unhealthy.
We should go to a nearby restaurant.
You want to go to Health Nut?

It rains a lot in the jungle. Rain helps the trees grow. The forest has many trees. Trees are home to many jungle animals. Many animals live in trees. Monkeys are jungle animals. Monkeys love trees. They love to swing from tree to tree. They come down from the trees. They're back in the trees. They sit in the trees. They eat their food in the trees. They eat the plants in the trees. They eat the fruit in the trees. They live in the trees with the birds. They live in the trees with lizards. They live in the trees with snakes. They live in the trees with the ants. The trees in the jungle are full of animals.,A2
"Spring is finally here. Last winter was long, cold and snowy. Gonzalo was ready to go outdoors and practice some sports. However, as Gonzalo was new in the city, he did not have so many friends. He decided to try to get some of his co-workers together. He put a newspaper in the company's dining room. The newspaper invited people to meet Gonzalo in a nearby park on Saturday for a football match. Football was Gonzalo's favorite sport. I've been playing it since I was a kid.

On Saturday morning, Gonzalo was excited to go to the park with his new friends to play football. I was a little worried people wouldn't show up. Gonzalo walked to the park early. I wanted to be the first to meet everyone. He packed his tacos and a ball in a backpack.
Gonzalo waited in open field near the park entrance. So everyone could see it. It would also prevent others from taking up space. Little by little, but surely, Gonzalo's companions began to enter the park. Some of them even brought friends and family out of work. Gonzalo was sure they'd have a great game.
""I brought a ball,"" Gonzalo told one of his co-workers Leo, who said he had also brought a ball. Leo said he was a big football fan. Sometimes Leo even had parties at his house to watch football. Both Leo and Gonzalo went to their backpacks to get their balls. It was then that they realized that there had been a communication error.
Leo's ball was oblong and brown, while Gonzalo's was a round football. Gonzalo had forgotten that in the United States football and football were different sports. Leo had forgotten too. They engaged and played a football game and a football game.",A2
"Karen and Betty Robinson were celebrating their birthdays. They were identical twins, and they had just turned 30. They went out to a baseball game with a couple of friends. They all bought beer, and each one drank eight beers. Karen couldn't drink as much as Betty, so she got drunk for the fifth beer. Karen and Betty knew they were going to drink, so they decided to take the bus to the game. All his friends came on the bus too.

When it was time to go home, Karen and Betty returned to the bus with their friends. They arrived at Union Station, and came down to catch their train home. They said goodbye to their friends, and they went to catch the train. People looked at them weird, because they could say they were drunk. When they were on the train, Karen began to feel sick. Betty looked at her, and she started laughing. Karen started throwing up, but she stopped. She got off the train, and she ran to the bathroom to finish puking.
When they came home, Betty told Karen to drink another beer to calm her stomach. Karen agreed and drank it. He calmed her down, then fell asleep. The next day, Karen and Betty woke up sick. They couldn't believe how drunk they were. They both felt terrible. Their stomachs hurt; their heads hurt; they both felt dizzy. When Betty went to work, she found a closet and fell asleep.

"Paul Martin didn't like going to his family reunion. He didn't know most of them, and he didn't even like the people he knew. Paul had always been a loner. He liked to do things alone; he went to the movies alone; he went to concerts alone; he liked to go to eat alone. So, at the family meeting, it was no surprise to see that Paul was sitting alone at a table where no one was sitting. From time to time, an aunt or uncle came to greet him, but none of his cousins greeted him. Paul agreed with that; he didn't care, because he didn't like talking to them either.

During his last family reunion, Paul decided to play a trick with his cousins. His cousins had been playing Nintendo in his uncle's room. Paul knew how to turn off all the energy in the house. He locked the door to his uncle's room, and then went to turn off the power. When all the lights went out, he could hear his cousins start screaming. They were upset because the game was going very well.
When their cousins tried to leave, they realized the door was locked. They started screaming for help, and Paul started laughing. All her aunts and uncles were out enjoying the party, so no one could hear the screams. Paul went back outside and sat down at a table. He was still laughing. An hour passed, and her aunt started looking for her son. When Paul's cousins were finally released from the room, they began to look for Paul, because they knew that he had locked them there. Paul wasn't worried; he knew they wouldn't do anything. He looked at them, laughed and listened to music again. The cousins sat down and ate something. Everyone was mad at Paul.",A2

The stakes were high for Luella. I had attended all the lectures this semester. She had written notes about taking notes home and studying. He had even sat in a few tutoring sessions after school. After handing over all his duties and passing all his questionnaires, Luella still felt that she could fail her final test. After all, it was cumulative, which means that the test would test her in everything she had learned.
Luella knew what she had to do. It was time to buckle up and study like there was no tomorrow. Motivated and determined, Luella sat on her desk and studied for at least three hours for the next three days. By the time the night came before the test, Luella felt confident that she would do well.
Luella woke up that Monday morning with a smile on her face. I dreamed of taking the test. In the dream she passed her test with an A. It's up to Luella to make her dream come true that Monday morning. Luella was sure she would. She knew that everything she studied was about to bear fruit as she entered her class and sat on her desk. ""Nothing can go wrong,"" Luella said.

"Disneyland is also called Magic Kingdom. It is located in Anaheim, California. The park opened in 1955, and was an instant success. When Anthony Martinez was a little boy, his brothers and sisters told him about Disneyland. At first, Anthony didn't know what they meant. He was too young, and he called it ""Dizzyland"" as he could not pronounce it correctly. His father had taken his older brothers to the park many times, but that was years ago. Anthony was much younger than his brothers and sisters.

For a long time, Anthony continued to ask his parents to take him to Disneyland, but the feeling finally faded. He stopped bothering his parents to take him away. One day, when Anthony was about eight, a classmate came to school bragging about his weekend in Disneyland. All of a sudden, Anthony wanted to go back. ""Please, Mommy, take me to Disneyland,"" Anthony begged his mother. His father heard him and immediately said, ""Okay, son, I'm sure we'll go this weekend."" Anthony's father had not realized that his youngest son had never been there, and he felt very bad about it.
The weekend came, and Anthony was very excited. I couldn't stay still. When they entered Disneyland, Anthony marveled at castles and other attractions. He especially liked the life-sized characters who wandered through the park. He grew up watching Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. Now I was taking pictures with them. Anthony was ""in heaven.""
The best part of the theme park is walks. ""Can we go to Captain Nemo's cavalcade?"" That question was soon followed by ""Can we go in the Matterhorn?"" Soon Anthony had gone on almost every walk. I was overwhelmed by the place. Soon the family was back on their SUV returning home with Anthony deeply asleep. It was the best day of his young life. One day later I would call ""the best day of my life. "".",A2
"Some of the most popular places to visit during the summer are the beaches. Kenneth Green loved going to the beaches. He lived near Venice beach, and he could walk to the beach in 30 minutes. He could smell the ocean every time he woke up. Kenneth and his friends decided to go to the beach on the first day of summer. When they got there, they found it was full of tourists and people trying to escape the heat.

Although the beach was crowded, Kenneth didn't care. I knew all the great places to go. He was friends with some shop owners. He was also a friend of the owners of a small Mexican restaurant. He had a small cabin reserved for him during the summer so that every time he was hungry he didn't have to wait for a table. The owners were friends of Kenneth's family and loved to have him around. Kenneth didn't like to abuse his relationship, so he only went to the restaurant once or twice a week, and always left good advice.
There are many activities to do on the beach. People can go swimming, renting a bike, playing volleyball or shopping. Kenneth is always careful when he's around volleyball nets and people on bicycles. Last year, he was walking through volleyball nets when a big man jumped to hit the ball, which ended up hitting Kenneth right on the head. The man ran to Kenneth to make sure he was okay. He was fine, but a little dizzy. As Kenneth was trying to regain his balance, he walked directly on the road of a bicycle. He crashed into a woman riding a bicycle, and they both fell. It wasn't Kenneth's favorite summer.",A2

"Mary and Tom became quick friends after their night meeting. Every night at seven, Tom would pick Mary up at his house and the two would walk Buddy around the neighborhood for an hour. Mary no longer walked alone to Buddy at night, and Tom no longer followed Mary.

One night, while walking Buddy, Mary and Tom decided to eat something because they were hungry. ""Where do you want to eat?"" Tom asked her to get married. ""Let's go to Pizza Mountain,"" she replied. ""I don't feel like eating pizza right now,"" Tom said. ""Do you have any suggestions?"" Maria asked. ""How about we go back to my house? I'll cook our own food!"" Tom said it. Mary thought it was a great idea. The two headed back to the street where they lived and thought about what to cook on the road.
When they arrived, they had decided to make burgers. Mary wrote a list of ingredients they were going to need to make burgers. Tom went to the fridge and took out all the ingredients he had. ""Where are the buns?"" Mary asked when she saw that they were missing. ""I'm gonna run to the market and get some burger buns,"" Tom said. By the time Tom got back from the market, Mary had prepared the food. All they had to do now was put the food between the muffins.
Mary and Tom were about to take their first bites in their burgers when Buddy walked through the door waving his tail and salivating. ""I think he wants a burger,"" Tom said. Mary got out of her seat and made a burger for Buddy. Buddy ate the burger in a bite as soon as Mary gave it to him.",A2
"David must have been the only kid in America who didn't like summer vacations. Every year, between the beginning of June and the end of August, schoolchildren were on vacation. Only for David, summer holidays meant work, work and more work! His father was a workaholic. I had two jobs most of the time. He had one job during the day and the other at night, but sometimes he also worked on weekends. The man had more energy than any living person. When he didn't work on the weekends at his third job, he worked at home and that's why David hated summer vacations.

His father was always building something, or tearing something down. If I wasn't tearing down a wall, or adding a new room to the house, I was putting in a new driveway or garage. It was hell for a 13-year-old boy. While all of David's friends were playing baseball or riding their bikes, he was usually dragging bricks or mixing cement. That's what you remember from your childhood.
David always knew he was in trouble when he heard ""Where's David!"" His father's voice seemed to be running down the street. That phrase can only mean that it's time to get to work. Of course, David learned through the years how to make himself disappear at the right times, but his father usually found him anyway. ""But Dad, I want to go to the park and play with my friends,"" David said. ""You can waste time with your friends another time. It's time to get to work now,"" his father replied. It got so bad that David would intentionally fail the classes so that he would have to go to summer school. The summer school was for students who didn't do well during the normal school year, but he didn't care. It meant less work. It meant freedom!

Betty's proud that her record is watching four movies in one day. He usually gets into snacks to eat at the movies. Betty doesn't care if nobody wants to go with her; she'll go alone and have fun.

After watching two of the movies, he bought a soda and was going to sneak into the next movie. As Betty approached the room where the film was shown, she realized that a man was looking for tickets. Betty started getting nervous.
Betty didn't have a ticket, but she really wanted to see this movie. He didn't like the other two movies; he knew he was going to like this one, because his favorite actor was in it. The man who was looking for tickets stopped Betty while trying to pass him. He asked for his ticket. Betty didn't know what to do. The man spoke English, so Betty decided to speak Spanish.

"Rocky was a big baseball fan. He lived in Philadelphia, but was originally from Los Angeles. He made sure to go see the Dodgers every time they played the Phillies. Rocky will never forget the last game he saw at Citizen's Bank Ballpark, which is where the Phillies play.

It started out as a normal game for Rocky. He sat on the stand with his girlfriend. He was completely dressed like a Dodgers fan. He had a Dodgers hat, T-shirt and T-shirt. As the game reached the seventh inning, which is the seventh inning and everyone starts singing ""Take me to the Ballpark"", he realized Dodgers pitcher Josh Beckett had been throwing a no-hitter. A no-hitter is when a pitcher does not allow a player from the other team to succeed. Rocky got excited, because he never thought he'd see a no-hitter, especially the Dodgers throw a no-hitter.
Rocky was holding on to his beer, but he didn't drink it. I was watching the baseball game very closely. His girlfriend talked, but he wouldn't listen. While Beckett was launching the final pitch, Rocky held his breath. He saw that it was an attack and jumped out of his chair. He even spilled some of his beer on his girlfriend, but she didn't care. She was happy too. Rocky was delighted. He started screaming loudly. He celebrated with other Dodger fans who were there and drank the rest of his beer.

"It was a hot day in Clarksville. The kids in the neighborhood were sweating and wanted to do something refreshing. The pool was closed because they were building something new on it. They thought about what they could do to escape the heat, but they could never agree to do the same. That's when Christopher Baker decided to go to the store. He bought 10 bags of balloons and went home to fill them with water. He invited his two best friends Joseph and Patrick to help him.

Christopher told them to wait for his signal, and then they could throw the balloons.

"I had the worst birthday of my life last year. It all started when my sister Donna invited my ex-girlfriend Jennifer. For some reason, Donna and Jennifer started getting along after we broke up. ""How convenient,"" I told Jennifer. Donna was always trying to make my life hell. I guess that's his job as the big sister. She was 20, while I turned 17 last year.

My mother had worked very hard to keep the party they were going to do for me in secret. It didn't work, because Donna had a big mouth, but she was trying to keep the secret for my mother's sake. My dad came home from work and told my mom to bring the kids so we could all go out for dinner.
We showed up at my favorite restaurant, which has a private room in the back for parties. It all went downhill as soon as I opened the door. My other ex-girlfriend Sarah was there, because she wanted to try and fix our relationship. I'll never forget the look in Donna's eyes. It looked like I'd seen a ghost.

"Frank just moved from an apartment to a small house with his family. When I lived in a six-story apartment building, dealing with garbage was easy. Frank dropped a garbage bag on a garbage compactor parachute. There was a garbage compactor parachute on every floor of the building. The parachute was in a small room next to the elevator. Frank had to bring cans, bottles and other recyclables into the basement and put them in a special bin. Although I didn't have to worry about remembering what day was garbage day. I didn't have to worry about taking the trash out for them to pick it up. That was the work of the superintendent of the building.

The two-bedroom house in which Frank moved had no superintendent. Frank got three trash cans from the city. Every trash can was a different color. Black was for normal trash. The blue was for paper, plastic and cans so they could be recycled. The green cube was for leaves, cut grass and tree ornaments. Each container had to be put on the sidewalk before the city's sanitation trucks arrived early on Monday morning. Frank couldn't get the cans out too soon, either. If you put the cans on the sidewalk before 6:00 p.m. on Sunday night, you could get a ticket and pay a fine.
Frank decided to put a reminder on his cell phone. Every Sunday night at 6:00 p.m. his phone reminded him to take the trash cans to the sidewalk. Frank also had to pay the city every three months for garbage collection. That was something he didn't have to do when he rented an apartment. Living in a house implies much more responsibility than living in an apartment building.

Most small boys growing up in the United States want to become a big league baseball player at one time or another. He remembers watching his favorite players on television when he was young, and how his father took him to watch the Giants play in Candlestick Park.

Johnny remembers the old stadium, and how big it looked as a kid. His father took him to the field one day when the team had a day of photos. Johnny couldn't believe how big the field was. All his favorite Giants were there taking pictures with the fans. ""Can I take a picture with Willie Mays' father? "", asked Johnny cheerfully. ""Of course, Johnny. Let's line up,"" his father said. Willie Mays was one of the best players in playing the game, and he also loved children. That's why the line to take a picture with him was so long. Johnny didn't care. I was in baseball paradise.
The Giants played their archrival, the Los Angeles Dodgers, that day. There had always been some bad blood between the two teams over the years. It started when both teams were based in New York. They were rivals on the other side of the city at the time. After the teams moved to California in the late 1950s, the rivalry continued.
The Dodgers were always one of the best teams in the National League, and even though Johnny grew up as a Giants fan, he didn't really hate the Dodgers. ""I think the rivalry broke out, to tell the truth,"" Johnny said years later. Baseball fans are very big and stubborn, and some play rivalry as much as they can.

My last vacation was a five-day trip to Prague in the Czech Republic. I know Prague well because I lived there when I was in college, more than ten years ago.
Instead of staying in a hotel, I stayed with one of my old friends. It was a lot of fun, and a little bit like my old life. I wanted to do all the same things I did on my college days, so I visited college. It's changed a lot and seems more modern. I also went to the supermarket near my old house. I loved seeing all the different foods. I was very happy to find my favorite cheese and chocolate cookies, but they were a little more expensive than I remember!

One of the boys was a five-year-old boy, and the other was a girl who was one year older than Sandra. Sandra's mother and father had presented themselves as neighbors. Sandra's mother suggested Sandra leave and do the same. Sandra didn't like the idea. However, Sandra's mother insisted and forced her to introduce herself to her new neighbors.
As she walked there, Sandra noticed the five-year-old neighbor's family playing in the mud in her front yard. Sandra came up to him and said, ""Hi, I'm Sandra. We're neighbors. What's your name?"" The boy looked at Sandra and shouted, ""I'm Benjamin!"" Then he threw a mud ball at Sandra. He screamed in shock. Benjamin's older sister ran out of her house to see what was going on, and noticed Sandra in mud all over her shirt.
Benjamin's sister apologized to Sandra and scolded Benjamin saying, ""Benjamin, apologize! Why did you do that?"" Benjamin responded by shouting, ""Because she killed my men and stepped on the castle!"" Sandra realized she was standing on her toy soldiers. Sandra then apologized and Benjamin's sister started laughing at her and said, ""Don't worry about it! I'm Jessica. What's your name?"" They both started talking. It was the beginning of a new friendship.",A2
"A great American tradition dating back to the birth of the country is the night of the board game. This is where two or more families gather at someone's house for dinner, and snacks, and then play. This is an activity where almost anyone can play. Most board games can be played by children 6 or 7 years old. It's fun for kids to test their skills against their older siblings, or their parents. One of the oldest and most popular board games is Monopoly. It is a game where all players start in the same place, and roll dice to advance from square to square.

Little Johnny wanted to join the game one night, and asked his parents if he could play. ""Please, Mommy. Please let me play with you tonight,"" he begged. His mother thought about it for a while, and she said, ""Okay, Johnny. Tonight you can play."" She didn't really think she would be able to play the game, but to her surprise, he was very good at it. The goal of the game is the bankruptcy of their opponents and they have most of the money at the end of the game. You buy properties with money raised moving around the board. The more money you have in your bank, the more properties you can buy.
Johnny landed at Boardwalk Square, which is a highly appreciated property. It's the most expensive property, but Johnny knew its value and bought it. The square is placed at the end of the game where everyone charges $200, but if you land on it, you have to pay a high rent. Johnny also bought a couple of nearby properties, and in no time, he was charging the rent of all the other players. Johnny ended up winning the game, which made him very happy, and also made his mother very proud of him. Johnny showed her and everyone else what he was capable of.",A2
"Albert had been playing guitar almost all his life. His first guitar was given to him by his father. He was a Fender Stratocaster, and Albert loved it. As a child, Albert spent hours listening to songs trying to learn them with his guitar.

As he grew older, he didn't play the guitar that much. He met a girl and they started dating. Eventually they had a son. Every now and then, Albert took out old Fender Stratocaster and played a song for his little son named Max. He loved playing guitar for Max, because it would calm him down when he started crying. As Max grew older, he began to listen to the same kind of music his father listened to.
Albert and his son listened to music together and talked about what they thought the songs meant. During Max's tenth birthday, Albert gave his son a Fender Stratocaster as well. The same model his father had gotten him. It cost her a little more, but she wanted her son to have the same as hers. Max was happy, he asked his father to teach him all the songs he knew. Albert smiled and said, ""Of course!""
When Max turned 17, he joined a band. They played local shows and were able to record some songs by themselves. One day, while Max was walking back from the band practice, someone stopped him and removed his guitar. I was devastated. He went home and locked himself in his room. He couldn't face his father. I knew I let him down. When it was time for dinner, Max opened the door to his bedroom and saw his father's Fender Stratocaster at the guitar stand. There was a card and a set of keys on the guitar. The letter said, ""My guitar hero, Max. Here's my guitar, you need it more than I do, and the key to your new car, so nothing like this will ever happen to you again.""",A2
"During the past week Elizabeth came home from work and discovered that her apartment smelled like cigarette smoke. I didn't know where the smell came from. Elizabeth didn't smoke. No one else had the key to his apartment to smoke in while he was at work. The smell of smoke bothered her especially because she had asthma.

One day Elizabeth stayed home because she was expecting a package. When she woke up that morning, the apartment smelled good. At one o'clock in the afternoon, Elizabeth went to the kitchen to make a sandwich for lunch. That's when he noticed the smell of cigarette smoke. He called the superintendent of the building. When she got to Elizabeth's apartment, the whole place smelled like cigarette smoke. The supervisor told Elizabeth that he was pretty sure that the smoke was coming through the vents of his new downstairs neighbor. The new neighbor smoked. The supervisor told Elizabeth there was nothing to do. The building was very old and the vents could not be sealed. It was also perfectly legal for the downstairs neighbor to smoke in his apartment. He suggested Elizabeth buy an air filter and see if that would help.
Elizabeth bought an air filter but didn't find it enough. Her asthma was getting worse. His clothes and furniture were also beginning to smell like cigarette smoke. Elizabeth decided to come down and talk to the neighbor. I was gonna ask him not to smoke in his apartment. Elizabeth knocked on the door. When he opened the door, a huge wave of cigarette smoke came out. Elizabeth began to cough violently. The neighbor gave Elizabeth an upset look. ""Are you trying to make me sick?"" The neighbor asked him. Elizabeth couldn't believe what she was saying. ""No, but you are,"" she said.",A2
"Going to high school wasn't fun. Joe's parents thought it would be a good idea to send him there instead of a public school because ""he would be distracted by the girls,"" as his mother would say. Once, during his third year, Joe begged his mother to let him go to public school. ""I just want to be normal,"" I said. ""I want to meet girls. I don't want to be weird."" But his words always fell on deaf ears. Mom always said Joe had plenty of time to go on dates after high school, and he needed to concentrate on his schoolwork.

This usually saddened him, but as a good boy, Joe nodded his head and continued his studies. Everything changed one day when Joe met Carmen, who lived two blocks from him. One day she met her at the market by chance. They had gone to kindergarten together. They were the same age, too. I was in Joe's class, and I also remembered Joe.
After about two weeks, they stayed stable. Joe was so happy, but he had to hide his relationship from his parents, which was fine because Carmen was hiding him from his family too! ""Are you kidding me?"" Carmen said, ""They'd kill me if they knew I had a boyfriend!"" Everything was going well for a while, but Joe's mother was right. His grades began to fall, and he was soon on academic parole because he spent too much free time with Carmen. He also dropped a grade or two. As a result, they both had to go to summer school to improve their grades, but Joe didn't care. I was in love and that was all that mattered at the time. Much later, he realized his mother was right.

"The school ended during the year. This meant that the school's after-school program, which kept Adriana June's daughter at school until she finished her job, was also over. The after-school program was convenient because June didn't have to leave school. Adriana didn't have to worry about her daughter being home alone. The after-school program also made sure June did her homework. This made Adriana's work as a single mother much easier. All he had to worry about when he picked up his daughter from school was dinner.

One of the best things about the after-school program was the cost. It's only $30 a month. The school didn't offer a summer program. Adriana didn't have a summer break at work, so she needed to find a program that she saw in June while working. Hiring a private nanny was too expensive.
Another mother from June school gave Adriana information about a local recreational center that was offering a summer program for school-age children. The program was not as expensive as other summer camp programs, but it was more expensive than the after-school cost. The summer program costs $50 a week. Adriana didn't know how she could afford the show.
June didn't understand the sacrifices her mother had to make for her. I was excited to attend the summer program. I've never been to summer camp before. June was especially excited because her friends would be there with her. Sometimes summer was boring, especially because her mother worked all day. June heard there'd be games and crafts. He was going to do something nice for his mother to thank him.",A2
"Maggie met her friend Lisa at a French restaurant downtown for lunch. Lisa was visiting New York from Chile. They met in Chile more than 10 years ago. That was the time when Maggie spent a semester abroad as part of her undergraduate studies. Lisa was a Chilean student who helped Maggie learn Spanish and play football. Even when Maggie returned to the United States, the two friends stayed in touch via Facebook and Skype.

Maggie greeted Lisa from the restaurant table when she saw her Chilean friend come in. Lisa looked the same, a little older and a little fatter. ""Tell me what's new with you?"" Maggie asked Lisa. Lisa explained that she worked for an airline and was in town on business. ""Now I can travel all the time,"" Lisa told Maggie. ""Really?"" Maggie answered. ""Yes, actually, and even sometimes I can get tickets for friends and family at very low prices,"" Lisa continued. ""Really?"" Maggie answered. Maggie was bothering Lisa. Lisa was starting to feel like Maggie didn't believe what she was saying. ""I can show you the memo of my work that explains everything if you don't believe me,"" said Lisa angry. ""Why wouldn't I believe you?"" Maggie asked and got confused. She thought it was great that Lisa had a job that would take her around the world, and even let her do it with friends and family.
""Well, are you still saying 'oh, really?' as if you were challenging what I'm saying,"" said Lisa. Maggie explained that when she said ""oh really,"" it just meant she found what Lisa was saying interesting and wanted her to elaborate. ""Really?"" Lisa said before the two friends laughed.",A2
"""You're a winner!"" That's what Helen Green read when she opened an envelope she received by mail. I couldn't believe it. She had won. Helen's husband, Roger, came to see why Helen screamed and jumped. Helen told Roger, ""You're not gonna believe it. Your sister entered a draw for a vacation in Hawaii, and we won. We won, Roger!"" Roger didn't believe it at first, but then he looked into it. ""Well, I guess we're going to Hawaii, honey,"" she told Helen. They both started jumping with joy.

Helen and Roger came to Hawaii, and they couldn't believe how beautiful everything was. They'd been married for 20 years, but they'd never had a vacation. After registering in their hotel room, they decided to go to the beach. They knew a surfer named William, although he liked to be called Will, who offered free classes. Seeing that Roger had always wanted to learn how to surf, they decided to leave. Will explained to Roger how to row the surfboard, and he taught him how to stand on it. After two hours of training in the sand, Will told Roger they would go out into the water. Roger didn't like that.
""Where are we going?"" Roger asked nervously. ""Over there,"" Will said, pointing to the ocean. He started getting nervous, and he started breathing heavy. Helen approached Roger and calmed him down. ""They're probably on their honeymoon,"" people said as Roger and Helen passed by. Roger laughed. He finally calmed down. He went out into the ocean with Will, and he tried to surf. Every time he tried to get on the surfboard he ended up falling. When they returned to earth, Helen hugged Roger and kissed him. ""You did great, honey. I love you,"" Helen said. Roger knew he was lying, but I've never seen Helen smile so much. He let go.",A2
"When William was transferred to a job in Texas, he was really worried about making friends. However, on their first day at the factory, they were all very friendly. You should join our softball league,"" his co-worker Richard suggested. ""It's a great idea, thank you, but I don't have a bat or a glove,"" William told Richard. Richard wrote down on a piece of paper the name and address of a nearby sports goods store. ""They'll have everything you need,"" Richard said.

On his day off, William went to the sports store. ""Boy, Rich wasn't joking,"" William said. They not only had bats and gloves, but also equipment for all kinds of sports. The store also had a wide selection of weapons. ""Are they toy guns?"" William asked. The salesman shook his head. ""No, sir. These are all work weapons. I also have machetes and knives if you want something more traditional,"" explained the seller.
""No, I just came in for some softball team,"" William told the salesman. ""Well, today you can take home any of these adorable rifles or guns along with your softball team,"" the salesman continued. ""Don't I need a license?"" William asked. The salesman shook his head. ""Isn't there a waiting period?"" William asked. The salesman shook his head again. ""Don't I have to take a security course?"" William asked. I couldn't believe it was that easy to buy a gun.
""No, sir. It's effective and take you here,"" said the salesman, ""Can I show you a good gun today?"" William shook his head. ""No, but can I take a picture? My friends in New York won't think it's that easy to buy a gun here."" ""Sure, my friend,"" the salesman said, ""I'll even take a picture of you with the weapons you want.""",A2
"One of the best games children play in America is Hide and Seek. You didn't need anything to play, and you could play for hours without getting bored. Another great thing about Hide and Seek is that anyone could play, boys, girls, young and old. Hiding and searching was great. All you needed was a little imagination and a sense of adventure.

The way the game is played is simple. I remember the first time I touched. I came with some of my brother's friends who were playing in the neighborhood. ""Hey, what are you playing?"" I asked. ""We're playing Hide and Seek,"" said Robert, my brother's best friend. ""Can I play?"" I asked, though I didn't know the rules. After a while, the boys let me play. The goal of the game is to hide from one of the players. This person closes his eyes and counts up to 10 loudly to start the game. While he or she is counting, the rest of the children run to look for a hiding place.
Hiding places can be anywhere. Behind the cars, or in the bushes, almost anywhere! It was Robert's turn. When he had counted 10, he shouted, ""Ready or not, here I come!"" Whoever is the first person found becomes ""It,"" and it's your turn to count. I thought I had the best hiding place in history. I was in the bushes near my house. I could see through the leaves everything Robert was doing, and I knew he was getting close to finding David, another of my friends.
I was so glad I wasn't the first to meet. I had shown myself to everyone who said I was too young to play when suddenly, a mouse ran over my foot! I jumped and screamed out of the bushes, and he was first found. Next thing I knew, I was counting out loud and trying to find my friends.",A2
"
George had always been a funny guy. I met him at the movies. I went to see the new Spider-Man movie, and he was there dressed like Spider-Man. He was acting like Spider-Man, and everyone was clapping for him and asking for pictures. My girlfriend wanted to go take a picture of him, and I said he was fine. When I approached him, I asked him if it was okay to take a picture of him and my girlfriend. He said yes.

I took the picture and started talking to him. He told me his friends hadn't shown up yet, and he didn't want to sit alone. My girlfriend and I decided to sit with him. After watching the movie, I asked her if she wanted to go get something to eat. He accepted my invitation. He made me and my girlfriend laugh all the way to the restaurant. We talked a lot on the phone. We were great fans of Nintendo games. I invited him to my house so we could play.
George never had anything wrong to say about anyone. He once told me that there's something good in everyone, some are afraid to prove it. George had invited me to his house one day to play old Nintendo games, but when I showed up at his house, nobody was there. I looked around and called him on his cell phone, but no one answered. I decided to leave and come back in an hour.
When I came back to George's house, I saw someone was inside. I knocked on the door, and an older woman came out. It was George's aunt. I asked him if George was home, he looked at me with sad eyes and said George was in the hospital. I finally understood why George was the way he was. George had cancer, and the doctors told him he could go any minute. That's why George was always looking for humor in life, because his real life was full of sadness.",A2

"Rob Hernandez thought the pet store's little girl was the cutest thing he'd ever seen. He had to buy it. He thought he was buying a baby duck, and he called his new pet Chaco. Chaco was loved and grew up fast. Rob began to notice, however, that Chaco was growing too fast and was getting too big. When Chaco made his first sound, Rob couldn't believe his ears. Rob was waiting for a charlatan, but Chaco honked. The Chaco wasn't a duck. Chaco was a goose.

Rob didn't turn Chaco down. He kept it as long as he could. The Chaco wasn't a quiet goose. He made a lot of noise, honking day and night. Rob's neighbors started complaining. Rob didn't want to hand over Chaco, but he couldn't risk his neighbors calling the police either. Rob had to make a decision.
Rob decided to take Chaco to a nearby park that had a lake with other geese. Rob felt sad leaving Chaco and was pretty sure that his feathered friend also felt sad. Rob goes twice a week to the park to visit Chaco so that both the goose and the owner are less sad. When Rob visits, Chaco swims through the lake to Rob's arms. Sometimes, Chaco will even give Rob a bit of a beak, a kind of goose to give a kiss.
When Rob visits, he always brings snacks for Chaco. The other geese seemed to be jealous of all the attention Chaco was getting, so now Rob brings enough bread for all the geese to share. Rob and Chaco play too. Rob throws his old pet into the lake. Chaco goes underwater, nothing a bit, and then he goes back to shore so Rob can throw it back.",A2

"My first road trip was horrible. When I turned 24, my father lent me his car to go from Los Angeles to Chicago. I told my father that my friend George was going with me, and that he was going to bring his girlfriend Nancy. My father liked George to leave, because he was a responsible young adult, which made me think that my father doesn't consider me an adult. When the day we were scheduled to go out arrived, George's girlfriend didn't come home until 5 p.m. when we agreed we'd meet at 2 p.m.

Not bad. I've been waiting for this road trip for a year. I could wait a little longer. When Nancy arrived, we packed her suitcase and left. I was friends with both of them, but George was my friend first. I started to get mad at them right away. Even though I had my music playing in the car, I could still hear them on the back kissing and calling each other baby, honey, honey, and other nauseous cute names. I didn't like it, but what was I going to do?
George took over the wheel after we left California. He was talking to Nancy the whole time. As we approached the Grand Canyon, Nancy began to talk about how she always wanted to see him. That's when George said those seven words he hated the most, ""What my baby wants, my baby gets."" He started going down a road leading to the Grand Canyon without even asking me. I started to get really angry, but I decided not to say anything. It was too late, but they didn't care. It turned out that the road leading to the Grand Canyon closed after some time. Nancy was embarrassed, and George started apologizing to me. After we got back on the road, I drove to Chicago. George knew he had microphones, so he tried to keep me company. He even told Nancy to sit back, what she did. It was a horrible trip. I couldn't believe I had to drive all the way back to L.A. with them.

"Janice was one of those people who loved getting up early for Black Friday sales stores after Thanksgiving. He loved going to his favorite stores to see what he could get for sale. A friend told her that her favorite store was going to have an amazing sale. They were going to sell a 60-inch TV for $300. Janice wanted to make sure he was there early. She went to the store during the night and set up a tent to sleep during the night.

Janice noticed that no one else had shown up when she was setting up her store, but she didn't care. He loved being there. I was so excited about the sales that I couldn't sleep. At 3:30 a.m. he finally fell asleep. She put the alarm on her phone to wake her up at 6 a.m., but because she left her music playing when she fell asleep, her phone ran out of battery.

"Alex was shopping at the local market yesterday trying to find some fresh vegetables for his dinner that night. The market is in the neighborhood, and it is not one of the giant, national, renowned shops. It's a small store with just a few locations around Los Angeles. Alex likes this kind of market much better than superstores because there are real people who run them.

Alex knows the guy who runs the fruit and vegetable section on the market. His name is Diego, who was born in Tijuana, Mexico, about 120 miles from Los Angeles. Diego always tells Alex what a good market buy is. ""Hi Diego,"" Alex said in Spanish. ""Hi Alex, how are you? "", he replied in English. This happens every time Alex talks to Diego. Alex speaks to him in Spanish, and Diego responds in English.
Spanish is spoken a lot in Los Angeles. The city has the largest population of Mexicans anywhere in the world, except in Mexico City. Alex likes to show Diego how much Spanish he knows, and Diego also wanted Alex to know how much English he knows. It's very funny to hear a conversation like this. Sometimes they get strange looks from people.
Today, Diego has beautiful oranges. They were big and chubby, and they also had the right price. ""These are great, Alex. You're going to like them a lot,"" Diego said.

Mark's mom had enough; she unplugged the game and told Mark they had to go out and do something else.

"Donald Walker always waited for summer. As he sat in class, he thought of all the things he was going to do during his summer vacation. He even made a list. At the top of his list he was swimming. Donald loved going swimming. Even though I was excited to have a break, there was something, or someone I was going to miss. Sarah Lee Parker was her classmate, but she rarely talked to her. Donald really liked Sarah. I knew I'd miss her.

The first day of summer had arrived. Donald woke up around noon. I hated waking up early to go to school, so I wanted to sleep late on the first day of summer.

The water was clear, but cold.
One of Donald's favorite things to do in the pool was to go on the diving board. While Donald was on the edge of the diving board, he started jumping in order to get high enough to make a flip. He jumped once, and then twice. When he was about to jump again, he saw that Sarah was looking at him from the entrance to the pool. Donald got so nervous he couldn't finish the turn, and he landed on his back. Everyone at the bottom of the pool started laughing.

Donald said he was nervous, and he started swimming with Sarah. Donald had never been happier, and he had never had so much pain.

He asked me, ""Could I have a disease? How could I have a disease?"" She said, ""You never know. What if a nurse stabs you with a dirty needle?"" He said that was ridiculous. Nurses don't trip. Nurses don't stab blood donors with dirty needles. He went to the blood unit the next day. He watched the nurses carefully. None of them tripped. None of them stabbed a blood donor with a dirty needle. It gave blood. He told his girlfriend that no one had stabbed him. He said he got lucky this time.",A2
His laptop sat on his desk. His laptop was always overheating. It always overheated quickly. How could he stay calm? He turned on his fan from the living room. He cooled his laptop. But the fan blew dust around. He flew paper around. He turned off his fan from the living room. He thought. He thought a little more. How could he keep his laptop fresh? I had an idea. He bought small blocks of plastic. Each block was a square centimeter. He put the laptop on top of the blocks. A block was under every corner of the laptop. Now the laptop sat a little over the desk. There was space under the laptop. There was room for fresh air to flow. Fresh air prevented overheating.,A2

I played football for my sixth grade school and hope to join a college team. I'm a morning person and I get up early to train and go to the gym. So I'd rather share it with other people who don't like being late at night either! I am also a vegetarian and, if possible, would prefer to share a kitchen with other non-meat eaters.",A2
"Hannah was worried about the plants in her garden. His state recently declared a drought and his plants were showing that the rain failed. His plants were all dead or dying. Its leaves were brown and dry. Even the small piece of grass in front of his house was drying out due to lack of rain and general water scarcity.

Hannah didn't want to give up her garden. He loved spending time in his garden. He loved working with his hands on the ground. He loved watering the plants and seeing, week after week, his hard work pays off. From a small seed on the ground, she cultivated flowers and herbs. This season, however, was a failure.
He started doing some online research on drought resistant plants, which are plants that would do well in full sun and without regular water. It turned out that there were quite a few drought resistant plants. Through her search on the Internet, Hannah even found a website for a place that sold native plants, which were naturally grown from its climate.
Hannah laughed at the name. It was called day care. Hannah always thought a nursery was a bedroom for a newborn baby or a very young child, not a place to buy plants. However, the more I thought about it, the more it made sense. Going to a nursery was like going to look for a baby. Except in this case, the baby was a plant that I would bring home.
Hannah drove 30 minutes to get to the nursery, which had a whole section of drought-resistant plants. He walked through the hallways in the open air, carefully considering his options. Then he stopped in front of a small seedling that was blooming. ""I found my baby,"" he thought.",A2
"It was almost 5 p.m. on a Friday afternoon. Ed was working. His partner Jack stuck his head in Ed's cubicle. ""Are you coming to Happy Hour?"" Jack asked. Ed had heard of Happy Meal, but he'd never heard of Happy Hour. Ed asked Jack what Happy Hour was. Jack explained that Happy Hour was actually a few hours on the working day afternoons when people left work, and when bars had special prices on drinks and snacks. Sometimes you pay for a single drink and give you two; other places have a special menu of food and drinks that is only good for certain hours.

Ed thought it really sounded like a good reason to be happy. However, Ed still had at least an hour of work to do. Ed's co-workers encouraged him to come and have at least one drink with them. Ed finally decided to go with them to the nearby pub. However, Ed had more than one drink; he had a few. He drank so many drinks that his coworkers put him in a cab home at the end of the night.
Saturday morning, Ed wasn't happy at all. She had a horrible headache and felt sick to her stomach. His wife made him a special soup and gave him some medicine.
When Ed returned to work Monday morning, he felt much better physically. His co-workers, however, mocked him about drinking so much on Friday. Your boss wondered why Ed hadn't completed all the work he was supposed to finish on Friday. Ed certainly couldn't tell his boss that he left work early to go drink with his colleagues. Ed was called to his boss' office to explain. ""I suppose he was too happy,"" Ed said unhappily.",A2
"One of the greatest American traditions is the baseball game. Living in Los Angeles has given me the opportunity to see one of the oldest baseball teams in the history of the game: the Dodgers. The team was born in New York City in the 1880s, when they were known by several names. Until 1956, the Dodgers played in Brooklyn New York, but in 1957, the team moved west to Los Angeles, and has played there ever since.

I recently asked my wife Josie if she wanted to go to a game one night, and of course she said yes. ""Why wouldn't I want to go? The weather is great and the stadium is beautiful. Besides, I think we need a break in our routine,"" he said. ""You're absolutely right, honey. Come on!"" I said.
We went to Dodger Stadium, which is located in the hills just north of downtown Los Angeles in a neighborhood called Chavez Ravine. Although it is the third oldest stadium in the country, it is still beautiful. ""Wow. This place never ages,"" I said when we got to our seats. Josie agreed. It was a perfect night for a ball game. The temperature was in the '70s, and it was a clear night, Breezy.
The Dodgers were playing Giants that night. The two teams have been playing for about 100 years, since both teams were in New York. The Giants moved in the same year as the Dodgers. They only moved north to San Francisco. But that didn't stop the rivalry. Teams hate each other today as much as in New York. The best part of the night was that the Dodgers won, so I had a couple of Dodger Dogs. ""I don't know what they do to these hot dogs, but they're delicious,"" I told Josie. He wiped some mustard off his face and said, ""Absolutely!""

"Every June, my old elementary school has a carnival on its floor. This has been happening since I was a little boy. I used to have a lot of fun there. It was amazing. I had rides like the Ferris wheel and flying tea cups. The Ferris wheel was this huge wheel that carried two people in a giant circle above the rest of the carnival. I remember the first time I did it when I was 7. I've been begging my mother for months to let me ride it.

""Please, Mom, please. I'm big enough now,"" I'd scream. However, she kept saying, ""You're too young, Billy. Maybe someday."" Of course, 7-year-olds have short memories. I kept asking again and again until he finally said he was okay, but he said he was going with me. ""I'm a big boy, Mom. I can go alone,"" I said. She wouldn't agree. ""Let's go together, or not at all,"" he said. And of course I said it was okay.
When the big day came, I was so excited. I almost had an accident while I was waiting in line. The guy who was sitting people kept saying ""Next"" as more and more people went up and the line kept shrinking. His screams of ""Next"" got louder and louder and I knew my time was coming. When we finally reached the end of the line, I felt as if I had waited a month, we put on our seat belts. I was excited and scared at the same time. Then it started.
I was so high in the air that I got dizzy. My stomach started spinning, and I felt like throwing up. It was too fast and too high for me. I didn't get sick, but I was glad I was back on the floor when I said to my mom, ""Please don't send me there again, Mom!""",A2
"""I'm calling the police,"" Barry said. ""I'm glad you called the police,"" Ruth said. Barry and Ruth had a nice house. They had a nice, quiet house. They had good neighbors. They had nice, quiet neighbors. But tonight, your neighbors weren't calm. They were having a pool party. Everybody was drinking. They all spoke out loud. Everybody jumped into the pool. I was playing loud music. The horns of the cars sounded. Barry and Ruth closed all their windows. But they still heard the party. Barry called the police. The cop said, ""We'll be there in an hour or two."" Barry asked, ""Why not before?"" ""The mayor is having a big party,"" the cop said. ""Most of our officers are protecting the mayor and his guests.""",A2
"""Do you believe in the ghost?"" Alvin asked his brother Levi one night, as they were lying in bed around eleven o’clock at night. ""I don't think so,"" Levi replied. Alvin and Levi shared a room together. ""Why not?"" He asked Alvin. ""I have never seen one,"" Levi said. Alvin was twelve years old and Levi eighteen. ""I think I saw one, Levi,"" Alvin told his brother, sounding scared. ""Go to sleep, Alvin,"" Levi told his brother, as he turned around in his bed to look into the closet. ""The ghost does not exist,"" Levi said.

Alvin and Levi were lying in separate beds. Levi had fallen asleep half an hour ago, but Alvin was still awake. He was having a hard time trying to sleep. A sound kept him awake. It sounded like someone was walking down the hall, right outside his bedroom door. It was completely dark.
Alvin was curious to find out who was walking in the hallway. It had been 15 minutes and the creak had not stopped. Alvin got up slowly from his bed. He headed to his door, taking one step every two seconds. When he finally reached his door, he put his hand on the doorknob and slowly began to turn it. The walk had not ceased.
""Alvin, what are you doing?"" Levi said just before Alvin could open the door. ""I think there's a ghost in the hallway,"" Alvin replied. Levi stood up and went to the door. ""I'll go with you."" Levi said. The two opened the door together and pulled their heads out the door to take a look. ""See, it was nothing,"" Levi said. Alvin and Levi went back to bed. Levi went back to sleep before Alvin. Alvin couldn't go to sleep. There was someone walking down the hall.",A2
"Mary was a girl with long brown hair and pretty eyes. Every night he took his dog for a walk. Mary's dog was a Beagle. He was named Buddy because he was so kind to everyone he met. Buddy never barked or bit anyone when Mary took him for a walk. Buddy didn't even shudder at seeing cats and other dogs. He was really a friend to everyone.

One night, while Mary was walking Buddy, something unexpected happened. For the first time in his life, Buddy got worse. ""What's up, Buddy?"" Maria asked. Buddy responded only in barking, as if he was trying to communicate again. Suddenly, the wind stopped and the air cooled. Mary decided to turn around and go home. But before I could, a rabid voice shouted his name. Mary turned around and shouted, ""Who's there?"" Buddy had stopped barking.
A child stepped out of the shadows and gradually revealed his identity. ""Tom, is that you?"" Mary asked the shy boy, who was now in plain sight. Tom looked down with his hand in his pockets. ""What are you doing, Tom? Have you been following me?"" Maria asked, a little confused. Tom was there ashamed and slowly started talking. ""I'm sorry, I ran away from you. I didn't mean to scare you,"" Tom said first. Mary knew Tom was nervous. She also knew about Tom's feelings for her.
""It's not safe for someone like you to be walking alone at night,"" Tom said. ""I'm not alone. I have Buddy,"" Mary replied. ""You should have someone with you and Buddy on nights like this,"" Tom said. ""Do you want to join me, Tom?"" Maria asked. Tom was too beaten to respond. I had been waiting for this moment to happen.

"One of the first things Gustav wanted to do when he arrived in the United States was to see everything he could. I'd be flying to John F. Kennedy Airport in New York. In New York City he planned to see the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty. Then I wanted to go to Philadelphia to see the Liberty Bell. Then he wanted to go to the nation's capital, Washington, D.C., where he hoped to see the White House, and even see the President. I knew getting to the three cities on the east coast was pretty easy. I could take a train or a bus.

Gustav was not sure how he would get to the other parts of the United States he wanted to see. For example, Gustav really wanted to see the Grand Canyon in Arizona. He also wanted to go to Los Angeles to see where some of his favorite movie stars lived.
Once in New York City Gustav asked the hotel concierge if they could arrange some trips for him. The janitor was helpful and informed Gustav about the different Amtrak trains he could take to Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. ""What about the Grand Canyon and Hollywood?"" Gustav asked. ""What about them?"" The janitor asked, looking confused. ""What about the trips there?"" Gustav asked. The janitor pulled out a map and showed Gustav how far Arizona and California are from New York. ""A train there will take you about a week. A plane trip will take about six hours,"" the janitor explained. Gustav was disappointed. I had no idea that the United States was such a big country. I was determined to see everything I could. He wondered how much it would cost to rent a caravan and drive it through the United States.",A2
"Let me tell you about my family. They're embarrassing to say the least. The first time I brought a child home to meet my parents, they asked him countless questions that no father should ever ask. ""When did you lose your virginity? Do you believe in Jesus Christ? How many sexual partners have you had?"" It's safe to say, that boy I brought home stopped talking to me after I met my parents. I stayed single all my time in high school. It wasn't that I didn't like anyone or that nobody liked it. It was that my parents had a rule. They had to approve whoever I was dating. Sometimes I thought they had that rule specifically to embarrass me.

I hate not being able to have normal parents. They're weird. They like to collect old books, and watch old movies. They listen to old records on an old record player. They say it's better than listening to an iPod. I always let them know that I can at least listen to my iPod when I leave. The last day of high school had passed, and I didn't know what I wanted to do. I decided to take a year off and work. My parents didn't like it, but it was my decision.
I got a job at a little restaurant called Baker's Cabin. It was a good restaurant where people could sit and have a good steak dinner at a reasonable price. I liked working there. However, what I liked most was waiter Paul. He had barely turned 21 and was already working behind the bar. We started talking. I think she really likes me, but I don't want things to get awkward when I meet my parents. One day, my friend Susan told Paul that the only way to go out with me was to meet my parents. Paul went that night with some records his father had given him, and offered them to my parents. They went crazy and invited him in. They began to ask questions, but not about their sexual life or religious beliefs. The questions concerned music. They really liked it, and they actually acted normal. I think Paul's the guy for me.",A2
"I just got back from the best summer vacation! It was so fantastic, I never wanted it to end. I spent eight days in Paris, France. My best friends, Henry and Steve, went with me. We had a beautiful hotel room in the Latin Quarter, and it wasn't even expensive. We had a balcony with a wonderful view.
We visit many famous tourist sites. My favorite was the Louvre, a well-known museum. I was always interested in art, so it was a special gift for me. The museum is so big you could spend weeks there. Henry got tired of walking around the museum and said, “Enough! I need to take a break and rest.
We take many breaks and sit in cafes along the Seine River. The French food we ate was delicious. The wines were tasty, too. Steve's favorite part of the vacation was the hotel breakfast. He said he'd be happy if he could eat croissants like that forever. We're having so much fun that we're already talking about our next vacation!",A2
"Hey, Fred!
It's been a while since we got in touch. How was your semester?
I wanted to send you an email update so you would know how things went during my semester abroad here in Malaga, Spain. I've been here six weeks now, and I feel like I'm finally adapting to culture. I also speak the language more fluently.
I arrived during the first week of September. The weather has been very pleasant. Although it is October, it is still quite sunny and warm. In fact, I went to the beach and swam in the Mediterranean Sea earlier today.
I'm living with a very welcoming foster family. I have my own private room, but we eat breakfast, lunch and dinner together. On Sundays, we eat a big homemade paella for lunch. In Spain, lunch is usually the biggest meal of the day. It is also very common for people to take a nap at noon just after a great meal. I'm waking up from my nap right now!
On working days, I take classes at the local university. There, I met several native Spanish speakers. They've been very kind and patient to me. At first, I fought to understand your Spanish, but now I understand most of our conversations. They have commented that my Spanish has improved a lot since we met. Now, I'm more sure to use the language in other places like shops and restaurants.
I'm so glad I decided to spend the semester here in Spain. We have a long weekend, so a group of friends and I are going to travel to France for four days. It is so easy and cheap to travel internationally in Europe. I love it!
I hope to hear from you soon. Like I said, don't hesitate to keep in touch more often. Maybe you could even come visit me! What do you think?
My best wishes,
Patrick",A2

"A strong boom woke her up. He looked at the clock by his bedside. It was midnight. ""What was that?"" asked her husband, who had not been awakened by the sound, so Betty shook him. He was followed by another strong boom. Then there was a sizzling sound. ""That's just fireworks,"" Betty's husband said. It wasn't July 4, the most common day to hear fireworks. It was just a regular Thursday night in mid-June. ""Why would there be fireworks now?"" Betty asked.

Betty and her husband just moved into a new house after their wedding. This was the neighborhood where her husband grew up. He said it was common for people to start lighting fireworks in the summer, even before Independence Day parties. ""All summer is a reason for fireworks here,"" Betty's husband told her. He said that even when it wasn't summer, people set fireworks for what they celebrated.
""Perhaps someone is having a graduation party or a birthday,"" Betty's husband told her. He said that sometimes people threw fireworks even when a local sports team won a game. Betty wondered what that was like legal. He thought the fireworks were illegal to buy and use. Betty's husband told her it was easy enough for people to buy fireworks. He also told her that different counties in the state had different laws, so that people could buy fireworks in a county and use them in a different county, like where they lived. ""People can also legally put fireworks for the holidays in addition to July 4, as well as for Lunar New Year,"" he added.
Betty tried to go back to sleep, but the loud and crackling noises continued. He decided to have a glass of water and go out to the yard to see the fireworks.",A2

"Tina was very involved in her daughter's education. He made sure his daughter did her homework. She also volunteered at her school. He especially liked to help parents who did not speak English. Tina used to translate into parent-teacher conferences and meetings. He also translated some of the papers the school sent home. Tina was a member of the parent-teacher association. He went to all the meetings and open forums. Tina was so active in her daughter's school that she was elected vice president of the parent-teacher association.

But the school principal didn't like Tina. She felt Tina was too involved. She didn't like how Tina insisted that there was translation at every meeting, and that every newspaper going home was in different languages. The director felt Tina was creating more work for her and her staff. She thought Tina was a troublemaker.
The way Tina looked didn't help her. He had many tattoos, and often dyed his hair in non-traditional colors such as pink and green. One night, after Tina's daughter received an award for her good grades, Tina went up to greet the director. The director replied coldly, ""Congratulations."" The director then offered some advice to Tina's daughter. ""When you grow up, don't become your mother,"" the director told the young lady. The child was confused. Tina was furious. How dare the director talk to you like that? Tina may not have looked like the other parents, but what she seemed to care about shouldn't matter. Tina's daughter hugged her mother. ""I don't care if you have green hair, Mom,"" she said, ""I care that you care about me and my school.""",A2

"Arsenal Eduardo's striker has been ruled out for two weeks with a tendon injury just days after returning from a broken leg.
Eduardo kneels after opening the scoreboard on his first Arsenal team on Monday.
The Croatian international only made its return after a year in the FA Cup of the fourth round of victory against Cardiff.
The 25-year-old scored his return with two goals in the 4-0 success at Emirates Stadium, but his last setback is not described as serious.
Manager Arsene Wenger told Arsenal TV Online: Eduardo is out for two weeks. He picked up a cord injury two minutes before I took it off. What a nightmare.
No one knows how it happened, but I knew right after the game that it would be a two-week job. It's nothing like I've done before, but I know little setbacks like this are part of being nine months out.
After all this time no one plays six months in the trot. It's impossible. But at the same time it's a hit because, of course, you can score goals. I had shown it on Monday night.

"Edward Allen always hated living in Los Angeles. Everything was too expensive; traffic was always bad; people were not friendly; it was always full. Edward never wanted to live in a big city. He always wanted to live somewhere in the countryside, in a small town, where everyone knew everyone. It was a dream he dedicated himself to achieving.

The day after she turned 26, she called her friend Lisa, who had moved to a small town in Iowa. He asked her what she looked like there. She told him she'd love it. It is quiet and peaceful; people are friendly. Edward decided; he was going to move to this small town. He sat down with his parents and told them what he planned to do. They supported his decision and helped him pack his things. He'll be gone in a week.
Lisa had helped Edward get a job where he worked, and she told Edward she could stay with her and her roommate until she stood up again. Edward was grateful. When he showed up, he immediately started working. He liked his job, but sometimes he found it a little boring. He was a waiter in a cafe. He liked the cake at the restaurant, so it wasn't all wrong.
After having been working for two months, she told Lisa she couldn't take it anymore. I wanted to go back to town. Lisa laughed and said, ""You've always hated the city, but now you're running back to it? I don't understand you, Edward."" Edward didn't think living in a small town would be so boring.

"My mother was pregnant with her second child. I was happy because I was going to be an older brother. My dad and mom told me I was gonna be a kid. I was excited, because that meant I could send him and tell him to do my homework. He told all his friends he was going to have a child. All his friends gave him his extra boy clothes that his children had worn, and my mom loved it.

My father was busy working in the baby's crib. He painted it blue, and he put a blanket with racing cars in it. When my mother entered the hospital, my father was excited and jumping up and down, but after my mother had the baby, my father came out with a confused look on his face. I asked him what was going on, if the baby was okay. She looked at me and said yes, but the baby was actually a girl. My grandmother looked at him and hit him in the head. She said, ""That's wonderful news. Don't look so depressed!""
My father laughed and said, ""No, I'm not depressed, I'm just confused."" For the first three months of her life, my sister looked like a child. She was wearing nothing but baby clothes, because that's all my parents had gotten for her. I took a lot of pictures, so I could tell her later that I was actually a kid, but there was an accident that turned her into a girl. My mother erased all my pictures because she was bad.

"Meryl was a little embarrassed to admit it. I was 37 years old, and I couldn't drive. When I was living in Queens, it wasn't that big a deal. Everything I needed was nearby. The supermarket was a block away. He took his shopping cart and got what he needed for the week easily. When I didn't feel like dragging the shopping cart, the supermarket even delivered for free. All I had to do was tip the driver. He used that same shopping cart to bring clothes to and from the laundry, which was just a block away. While Meryl's work wasn't a block away, the subway station was. Every day I walked around the block to take a 45-minute underground trip to work. He repeated the journey backwards to return home at night.

Although the Alhambra was different. The ride from Meryl's house to the supermarket was almost a mile away. I didn't feel like walking this far as I pushed the shopping cart full of a week's food. The laundry was a mile away in the other direction. She wasn't gonna push her dirty clothes through so many streets. There were no trains nearby to take her to work, just buses. Buses always took a long time to get there. For the first few weeks, Meryl was always late everywhere. Sometimes, when she had an urgent appointment, Meryl asked her friends to take her somewhere. Almost all his friends had cars and they knew how to drive. Most of them learned it when they were in high school.

It was a Chihuahua called Taco. He wondered if Pet Wonders was selling Chihuahuas.

Jenny and her father were greeted by a short bald man, who smelled like dog food. ""Hello, how can I help you today?"" The man said. ""We're here to buy a pony!"" Jenny exclaimed to the man. ""Actually, we're here to sail,"" Jenny's father said right after. ""Let me know when you're ready to make a purchase,"" the man replied. Jenny and her father proceeded to look through the halls.
""What do you think of this, Jenny?"" He asked his father. ""They're too small,"" he said. Jenny saw a variety of colorful fish. ""What about these, Jenny?"" His father asked. ""They're too viscous,"" Jenny said. Jenny met snakes and turtles. ""Do you want one of these?"" He asked his father. ""I don't think so,"" Jenny replied. An hour passed and Jenny had not yet decided on which animal to choose.
Jenny and her father finally came to see cats and dogs. ""It's one or the other,"" Jenny's father said, pointing at cats and dogs. Jenny had to think long and hard about which pet to get. After what seemed like an eternity, Jenny looked at her father and said, ""I can't choose one."" His father stopped for a minute, smiled and said, ""Then pick two."" Jenny went home with a white cat and a black dog, which were the best birthday present she had ever received.",A2

"""Did you do your costume last night?"" I asked my girlfriend Audrey in the early morning of October 31. ""Of course, I was ready, but you're not going to see him until tonight,"" he said. That was a real disappointment. I really wanted to see his latest Halloween creation. Audrey is a good seamstress, and every year she makes the best costumes for the Halloween parties we try to attend. On the other hand, I usually wear some old rags and go like a bum or a pirate or something, but Audrey doesn't. He's going everywhere. Last year, she was like a beautiful witch complete with the pointed hat and the witch broom. She looked beautiful.

The Halloween tradition is very old in the United States. No one really knows how it was held for the first time, but it came from somewhere in Europe. It was originally called ""All Holy Vespers"", and was celebrated on the last day of October. Precedes the ""Day of All Saints"", which is a day to honor dead relatives. Today, it means parties for adults and ""Trick or treat"" for children. ""Trick or treat"" is where children also dress up in costumes and go door to door to get treats. It's a lot of fun.
Some people say Halloween is a Welsh tradition, or Celtic, while others say its roots are Christian, but it doesn't really matter anymore. We like to dress like fools, go to parties and eat a lot of candy! Audrey finally showed up at my door. She was amazingly beautiful. She was dressed like a fairy princess and shone in her white dress. ""You look amazing,"" I said. He laughed and said, ""I know,"" and he touched me with his wand.",A2

"Dennis had always been a terrible student. When he was a child, his parents sent him to a Catholic school. I didn't know much about school. Of course he didn't know much about anything when he was 6 years old, but he did know one thing: all his friends in the neighborhood went to a public school. Dennis was the only guy who went to private school, and his friends often made fun of him. ""You're not one of us! You're not one of us,"" they sang sometimes. But I wasn't really alone. Her friend Patricia also went to Catholic school, but she was a child. After a while, they started walking together to the little school every morning. Pat was the first friend Dennis ever had. She wasn't his girlfriend. She was just a friend who turned out to be a girl.

The nuns at school were very bad. They ran the school like it was a prison. Dennis was afraid even to raise his hand to ask a question. His mother was often called to meetings with the director about Dennis, who also sat in the office listening to the director telling his mother how smart he was, but he was very lazy. Needless to say, Dennis didn't do well at school and ended up going to college after high school. He didn't do very well there either, and he soon abandoned him.
All that changed after Dennis grew up and started working. He had worked for many years before deciding that he wanted to get a degree after all. Dennis returned to school at the age of 30, and was soon a college graduate with a degree. It turned out Dennis wasn't as lazy as those nuns thought he was.",A2

"""When are you going to cut your hair?"" Johnny's relatives asked every time they saw him. Johnny's answer was always the same: ""When pigs start flying."" Although Johnny was aware that his relatives thought it was funny, he was also aware of his concern regarding his long shoulder hair. Johnny's hair was black and wavy. He started growing it after high school. It had been two years since then, and Johnny had no intention of cutting it off soon.

Johnny loved his long hair, and he took good care of it. Every day he washed it and brushed it fifty times. Johnny felt so good with his long hair. He made him look like a rock star. While in high school, Johnny always had short hair. Although he did not seem unattractive, he was not too fond of his short hair, and wished to grow out one day. He promised himself to do it after graduating. Johnny had kept his promise.
Johnny's hair got a lot of attention. As I walked down the street, I often heard ""nice boy of hair"" from strangers. ""Thank you very much,"" Johnny replied, being flattered. Once, Johnny passed by a group of girls who laughed and looked at him. ""I like your hair,"" one of them told Johnny as he walked away. Being the cool cat he was now, Johnny loved every minute of having long hair.
Johnny wondered why he didn't decide to let his hair grow earlier. It was the best decision I had made, and nothing in the world could make him cut it.",A2
"Police and neighbors were looking for three young guys from Michigan on Saturday who have been missing since their father claimed he left them with a woman before attempting to commit suicide a day earlier.
The father survived his suicide attempt and is being treated at a mental health center, said Morenci, Michigan, chief of police Larry Weeks on Saturday.
But the Michigan authorities do not know what has happened to their children, Tanner Skelton, 5 years old, Alexander William Skelton, 7 years old, and Andrew Skelton, 9 years old, urging them to issue an amber alert on Friday.
Weeks said the children's father, John Skelton, told the police that he left the children outside Friday morning with a woman who identified as Joann Taylor, partly to make sure they didn't see him while and after he tried to commit suicide.
John Skelton told the police that the woman, whom he allegedly met on the Internet, should leave the children at his home in Morenci, a city in southern Michigan of about 2,400 people about 40 miles west-northwest of Toledo, around 3 p.m. on Friday.
But the boys never went home and, Weeks added, the authorities are still not sure whether the story of John Skelton, including the existence of Joann Taylor, is true or an invention.
We haven't been able to locate a Joann Taylor or confirm that he even exists, Weeks told reporters on Saturday night.
The last non-family saw the boys at 5 p.m. on Thursday, according to the boss.
His mother, Tanya, has been with the police almost all day Saturday, answering questions and serving as what Weeks called a valuable resource right now.
Weeks said Tanya Skelton had contact with someone who claimed to be Joann, adding only that this communication was not necessarily by phone or in person.
According to Amber Alert, Taylor may have been from Jackson County or Hillsdale County and may be driving a silver van. However, Weeks reiterated that they have not yet confirmed that she is real and, if so, if she is with the boys.
Saturday's press conference was full of media and residents of Morenci, many of whom have been looking for young people. Dozens spent Saturday searching Bean Creek, Wakefield Park and Riverside Natural Area, all in Morenci, according to WUPW, a CNN affiliate in Toledo.
We just hope they're somewhere safe and warm playing video games, volunteer Carol Garcia told WUPW.
But the authorities so far have offered few advice pointing community members to places where young Skelton might be.
“We understand your urge and desire to be out there,” Weeks said. The fact is, I can't tell the community that there's a specific location they should be looking for.
The alert indicates that Tanner is 3 feet, 6 inches tall, has strawberry blond hair, has blue eyes and weighs about 40 pounds. Alexander is 3 feet, 9 inches tall, has brown hair and eyes, weighs around 45 pounds and has scars on his hairline and chin. The older brother, Andrew, is 4 feet, 1 inch tall, has brown hair and eyes and weighs approximately 57 pounds.

"At least 26 people were killed on Monday in the Syrian government's current crackdown on dissidents, the pro-democracy group Syrian Local Coordination Committees said.
Among those killed was a 12-year-old boy shot dead when Syrian security forces fired in a funeral procession, according to the Syrian Human Rights Observatory based in London.
The funeral procession was for a protestor killed on Sunday, the observatory said.
In addition, 17 people were killed during the operations of the military and security forces in Hama while the authorities were looking for wanted activists and protesters, the organization said.
Meanwhile, an advisor to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said that parliamentary elections could be held in the country by the end of the year, Russian media reported on Monday.
Bouthaina Shaaban, al-Assad's political and media advisor, was in Moscow on Monday to talk to journalists about the situation in Syria.
I can say provisionally that these elections can be held at the end of this year or at the beginning of the next year, Shaaban said, according to the RIA-Novosti news agency.
The number of people killed in riots in Syria since mid-March has reached at least 2,600, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said on Monday.
Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department is condemning the murder of a key Syrian opposition organizer who says he died while in the custody of Syrian security forces.
Ghiyath Mattar, described as a key organizer of protests against the al-Assad regime, was killed after being arrested last Tuesday in the Darya suburb of Damascus, State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland said in a statement published on Sunday.
His courageous commitment to confront the regime's despicable violence with peaceful protests serves as an example for the Syrian people and for all those who suffer under the yoke of oppression, the statement said.
Mattar was arrested along with main opposition activist Yahya Sharbaji and several other activists, Nuland said.
Mattar was a symbol of what the Syrian revolution should be, peaceful and nonviolent, said one of Mattar's friends. His death is an attack by the regime on peace. Their attack says: We want to destroy the messengers of peace in Syria and the ideals and values they have.
His personality was perfectly built to take the role of a leader, said another man, a mate of Mattar's. Everyone loved him and had so many close friends and relatives.
Both men asked not to be appointed for fear of retribution.
On September 6, Mattar was with Sharbaji when he received a call from Sharbaji's brother saying he was wounded and needed help, according to the friend. In fact, the security forces had forced the brother to call Sharbaji. The operation led to the arrests, the friend said.
The riots have ravaged Syria for more than six months, as protesters demanding more freedom, democratic elections and the end of the al-Assad regime have been hit by brute force.
The government has maintained a consistent narrative: it is following armed terrorists. But opposition activists say the regime is behind a systematic and sustained killing.
Mattar, 26, was on the run for three months before being arrested, according to the Syrian Observatory.
The group, citing reports from other members of Mattar's opposition, said he was tortured to death.
Syria's repression of protesters has been strongly condemned by many world leaders and the United Nations. The Arab League has publicly called on the Al-Assad regime to show restraint and put an end to the violence.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Syria, freezing the assets of certain regime members and banning Americans from doing business with the country. The European Union banned the import of Syrian oil and imposed a travel ban.
Navi Pillay, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, put the number of deaths in the riots at 2,600, citing reliable sources on the ground, in comments prepared for delivery on Tuesday during the commission's session.
The Syrian Observatory has said that more than 2,000 people -- mostly demonstrators -- have died since the uprising began in mid-March.
In his statement, Nuland repeated the calls of the United States for al-Assad to resign.
We call on the regime - LRB - al-Assad-RRB - to put an immediate end to all violence against the Syrian people and release all political prisoners. Once again, we ask - LRB - al-Assad-RRB - that they step aside and allow the Syrian people to embark on the democratic transformation they demand, he said in the statement.
A video posted on YouTube supposedly showing Mattar's funeral in Darya showed people marching on the street and singing: We're going to sacrifice our lives and our blood for you, Ghiyath and Freedom, freedom, we're the young people of freedom.
Mattar's colleague said that Syrian security forces fired on the mourners, and that a man was shot and later died.
CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video, claims, or number of deaths because the government has repeatedly denied journalists' requests to report inside Syria.
Salma Abdelaziz, Maxim Tkachenko, Mohammed Jamjoom and Yousuf Basil of CNN contributed to this report.

"For many who saw his long and rambling video statement, Boko Haram Abubakar Shekau's leader seemed strangely distracted, out of focus, perhaps under the influence of drugs while boasting of kidnapping nearly 300 Nigerian schoolgirls.
But there is calculation in such cruelty, and method where some see madness. The kidnapping serves Shekau on many levels, and Boko Haram observers say it should not be underestimated.
Shekau's acting on camera is the opposite of the composite appearances of the late leader of Al Qaeda Osama bin Laden and the current head of the terrorist group, Ayman al-Zawahiri. Jacob Zenn, Boko Haram expert with the Jamestown Foundation, a research and analysis firm based in Washington, D.C., says Shekau has even recognized the intellectual chaos of his presentations. But they impress their followers.
Shekau speaks classical Arabic and Hausa, the language of northern Nigerian Muslims, and had a religious education. As a deputy of the former leader of Boko Haram Mohamed Yusuf, who was murdered in 2009, Shekau delivered sermons full of references to Islamic scholars. He also expressed admiration for Al Qaeda as a jihadist movement, although Boko Haram is not an affiliate of the group.
Shekau’s rejection of the Christian calendar and loyalty to the Nigerian flag resonates in a region where the resentment of a corrupt and distant government is deep. And his frequent reference to the great Bornu Empire, a Muslim kingdom that ruled northern Nigeria for about 500 years, returns to a golden age.
He's also ruthless in dealing with dissent. Shekau has no attachment and Zenn says the videos broadcast by the group never show other commanders. He kills anyone who challenges him, but blowing him up like a madman would underestimate his abilities, Zenn says.
Twice injured himself -- in 2009 and 2012 -- Shekau seems to delight in violence. After a series of attacks in Kano in 2012, he said: I like to kill anyone God commands me to kill, the way I enjoy killing chickens and rams.
Nor would Zenn be surprised that Shekau was under the influence of drugs when he recorded his statement on video; sometimes the Nigerian military has found them in Boko Haram camps.
I said I would...
Once again, the mass abduction of adolescent girls faced a threat that Shekau has repeatedly made. Western education is a prime objective of Boko Haram because, in the group's view, it reinforces colonial and Christian influence and suppresses Islam.
In a July 2013 video, Shekau promised that schools would be burned and teachers killed. He's been faithful to his word. In February, a school in Yobe State in northern Nigeria was attacked and burned, leaving 29 children dead. And last September, more than 40 students from an agricultural university were killed.
By abducting so many schoolgirls, Shekau may also have wanted to humiliate the Nigerian government just as the World Economic Forum met in the Nigerian capital, Abuja.
Shehu Sani, a human rights activist in northern Nigeria who has previously been involved in mediating with Boko Haram, believes that kidnapping and other recent attacks are messages to the Nigerian government that the recent arrest of Boko Haram supporters in Islamic schools will be avenged. In 2012, Shekau's wife and three children were reportedly placed in military custody.
Every time people have started talking about Boko Haram's decline, it has emerged as more deadly and fierce, Sani told CNN. This is a strategy of violence rather than ideology.
Rewarding Fighters
Boko Haram has suffered several setbacks in the last year. The emergence of civilian vigilante groups in cities such as Maiduguri has pushed him into rural areas and the Nigerian army has gone on the offensive against the group.
According to Sani, Boko Haram now recruits most young people in the countryside, coercing or financially inducing vulnerable young people from poor households to join their ranks. The mass abduction of Chibok teenagers may have been part of Shekau's effort to strengthen the loyalty of these largely uneducated young women, providing them with free servants or sex slaves, Zenn suggests. In her video, Shekau said of the girls: We would also give her hands in marriage because they are our slaves.
It is likely that many will end up becoming mothers, it is a real horror and in the coming years we will slowly hear the stories of little girls by few as they succeed, Zenn told CNN.
Shekau's almost medieval inflexible salafism sees girls and women as servants for whom education is a sin. Women must get married, he said in the video statement.
You can't get them back.
The location of the abduction and the figures in question were clever decisions by Boko Haram. The girls were taken from their school beds, loaded with buses and trucks and quickly transported to remote, mountainous and wooded areas on the northeast corner of Nigeria. Boko Haram fighters can cross the permeable borders with Cameroon and Chad to restock and hide, and U.S. officials believe that some of the girls have already been taken out of Nigeria.
Sani said the time was not an accident: the school was full of Muslim and Christian students taking their final exams.
They are likely to be in rural, mountainous and wooded areas on the move with fighters, with some forced to marry, he told CNN.
Zenn says it'll be very difficult to get them back.
Boko Haram has probably been separated or sold to girls in many small groups, and can be used as human shields in case of an attack, he said.
Sani also fears any military operation.
Any attempt to rescue the girls by force will end in a tragic result, it could be the Beslan of Nigeria, he said, referring to the attempt to release hostages in a school in Russia in 2004 that left more than 300 dead, many of them boys.
Prisoner negotiation chips, cash or concessions
Shekau is not beyond negotiating with the Nigerian government, despite its apocalyptic rhetoric and frequent denials of the legitimacy of President Goodluck Jonathan. According to the International Crisis Group, a year ago negotiations in Côte d'Ivoire were about to produce an apparent peace agreement that was to begin with a ceasefire. Shekau was then designated a terrorist by the U.S. State Department and abandoned the talks.
Sani believes that Boko Haram targeted the girls to force concessions from the Nigerian government, perhaps beginning with the release of Boko Haram supporters from the prisons.
The fact that Shekau said he would sell the girls and not kill them is a clear indication that negotiation is possible. Shekau's video isn't gonna be the last word of the group about the girls.
And Sani suggests that the idea of selling girls shouldn't be taken literally. People don't buy girls in this part of Africa, he said.
But at least some of them can be traded for ransom money. Boko Haram has begun trading hostages for cash, especially in the case of a French family abducted in northern Cameroon last year and allegedly released for about $3 million. It also threatens Northern business leaders with kidnappings or worse unless they pay.
The international outrage caused by the kidnapping also serves Shekau.
He doesn't care at all about international opinion, but he knows he's pressured the government to get in touch with him, Sani said.
It is not clear how that process could work, but Sani has asked that a group of Islamic clergy and others be set up to seek mediation. That would require the renunciation of recent laws prohibiting anyone from having contact with Boko Haram.
Few believe that Boko Haram will wither until the government addresses the inequalities in the allocation of funds between the southern Christian oil producer and the Muslim north.
Sani says the stakes couldn't be higher for the region.
For now, the focus of Boko Haram remains Nigeria, but as they become emboldened they will spread like cancer throughout Central and West Africa.

"The night Bob Hawke lost his Labour leadership 20 years ago, I was a recruit from the Canberra press gallery who I found, fortunately, abandoned at the door of the Prime Minister's office while the Labour caucus was dispatching the occupant.
Wronged by the security guards - and then hurriedly clearing the nearby corridors - as a member of the Prime Minister's staff, I was allowed to witness Hawke's return to his office and his waiting family as former Prime Minister, at that time the only one who was rejected by his own party.
Hawke came out of the caucus room, chin forward, wet eyes forward, a clutch of cane down behind. At the same time as his office door opened and his then wife, Hazel, burst out, sobbing. Either he had been waiting for the worst or, more likely, there had been a telegraph phone call.
She threw herself at her husband. Hawke picked her up, telling her not to cry, don't cry. And when she disappeared in her office, she barked: I need a bloody cup of tea.
If the humiliation of that night's historical rejection disrupted him, Hawke didn't show it.
Soon after, liquor carts rolled along the corridors of the House of Parliament and Hawke hosted a wake that was for hours, open to all visitors. He was angry, in my view, only once that night; he reviewed a particular reporter who had bathed him with sympathy but who, in Hawke's opinion, had long been fulfilling the victor's order, Paul Keating.
Australian FM Kevin Rudd resigns
Never before had the Labour Party left a Prime Minister in service, but Hawke's equanimity, at least outwardly, was surprising. You could have said that he seemed resigned and released because of the loss of work he had had for almost nine years. Of course, the long competition with Keating had been aggravating for Hawke and sapping for his government; Keating had effectively launched his challenge at the end of the previous year, in 1990, when he held, in his speech to Plícido Domingo, that Australia had never had a great Prime Minister. He then challenged Hawke in mid-1991, lost and went to the back bench until his second -- and successful challenge -- late that year.
Hawke, the Labour Party and most Australians knew that Keating had Hawke in line to kill.
Not so Kevin Rudd.
It has been an undeclared underground campaign to reinstate Rudd in the Prime Minister's office, a campaign from which the candidate has been able to stay distant so far. Rudd has presented himself as busy and contented within the Cabinet under Julia Gillard. As he described it last week, he has been a happy little Vegemite as Australia's Foreign Minister.
Invariably for Rudd, the questions about the quality of the leadership of the Labour Party, the convenience of those who took him out of the Prime Minister's office or those who published the now infamous video of his anger on YouTube, are questions that, according to him, should be asked to others. It therefore causes those others -- and most of us know who they mean -- to fall under suspicion.
And in the resulting public image, it is not Rudd who is trying to return to the Prime Minister's office; rather, it is a semi-remnant Rudd who is being transported by a group of ministers, parliamentarians and labor fixators who believe that the only way Labour can win against Tony Abbott and the Coalition in the upcoming elections is for Rudd to resume leadership.
Gillard calls for Australian Labour Party leadership vote
His tactic has been to prevent Rudd, unlike Keating, from being seen as an active seeker of his Prime Minister's work. The reasons are double. Rudd's camp has not wanted to give the Prime Minister a reason to confront them head-on because to do so would risk provoking a leadership vote before Rudd has gathered the numbers he needs, and it is still doubtful that he has. Second, for Rudd to be seen publicly tearing away Gillard's leadership would play a series of strong negatives -- that Rudd is motivated by revenge, that he has no respect for the government, that he is attacking a woman, that has a monstrous sense of right.
It may even be true, as some of Rudd's activists have claimed privately in recent days, that Rudd did not intend to recover his old job after Gillard deposed it in mid-2010. That, on the other hand, the current bad electoral opinion for the Labour Party, some pitfalls avoidable by Gillard, stubborn resentment within the electorate about the way of his ancestry and the blandishments of some of his colleagues combined to persuade Rudd that his return was feasible.
But Rudd had to be seen to be recruited by his party again in the Prime Minister's office.
Behind the scenes of Australia's political soap opera '
That plan still seemed intact until 1338 hours on Saturday, February 18, when a user of You Tube, under the name HappyVegemiteKR, uploaded a video showing a frustrated and increasingly furious Rudd trying to complete a video message in the Chinese language, but bumping into the words. Filmed at least two years ago in his office, while he was Prime Minister, the video contained Rudd's unusable and profane shots, a bunch of gnashing teeth, wild-eyed rage, and blaming others including the assholes at the embassy.
Because the images were likely to have been held in a Government archive, suspicions lie with the Prime Minister's office or somewhere nearby as a source of HappyVegemiteKR. This conspiracy Gillard denies, but the investigation, Rudd says, is another one of those questions for others.
Whatever its source, the HappyVegemiteKR video will probably be remembered for both the entertainment provided by a dirty Rudd, and the trigger that brought his leadership challenge to light.
Rudd learned about the activity of HappyVegemiteKR's You Tube on Saturday night while eating a Thai meal to take home in Brisbane with Bruce Hawker, the Sydney-based political strategist who has led many Labour election campaigns.
Hawker is now openly connected to Rudd's campaign camp and helped advise Rudd that night.
Conspiracy theorists are in number, Hawker says. But I was with him, and he was embarrassed and worried and understood that he had to handle the problem quickly. The complication was that he was leaving the country the next morning. So the decision was made to contact Sky, which is a 24-hour news channel, and do an interview. In the end, I think it was appropriate.
Driven and legitimized by the leaked video, by midnight on Saturday Rudd was on Sky News, effectively sending the Labour Party and Australians a revised curriculum that set their qualifications for another opportunity in the Prime Minister's work. Apologize for his language on the video, he said he had changed since he was deposed by Gillard almost 20 months ago. He had learned to delegate more, to become less angry and to listen, especially to his colleagues.
It was a coded request for the return of his old job. And it was reinforced on behalf of Rudd on Monday morning when the former Queensland Labour Prime Minister, Peter Beattie, publicly urged the Prime Minister to hold a leadership vote. Queensland's band of brothers -- Rudd, Beattie and Bruce Hawker -- finally managed to publicly expel the prime minister's main ministerial supporters to recognize what they have been careful about for weeks: Gillard's leadership is under siege within his own cabinet and party hall.
Tactically the day was a victory for Rudd; the issue of leadership was in public and now, sooner or later, it will have to be confronted.
There's anxiety and uncertainty on both sides about whether they have the numbers. Gillard will not vote, however, and behaves as if life were as usual in his dealings with the man he calls his foreign minister, usually - LRB - and unusually -RRB - not by his name. And Rudd is in the Mexican tourist town of Los Cabos at a G20 meeting and will not return to Australia until the weekend.
Will it force a challenge when parliament returns on February 27th?
Bruce Hawker, a man who might know, offers this: however, I believe that once Rudd returns to town, there will be another build-up of pressure for this matter to be resolved once and for all.
Should Rudd force a vote? I don't know exactly how this is going to play. There are several scenarios, but one thing that seems completely unlikely is that it will simply disappear and that people will forget about it and move on to another topic. This is a boil that has to be launched.
Gillard, it's to be expected, you know. She's held that spear before.

"Swedish prisons have long had a reputation throughout the world for being progressive. But are the country's prisons a soft option?
The head of the Swedish Prison and Probation Service, Nils Oberg, announced in November 2013 that four Swedish prisons would be closed due to a “out of the ordinary” decrease in the number of prisoners.
Although there has been no drop in crime rates, between 2011 and 2012 there was a 6% drop in the prison population of Sweden, now just over 4,500. A similar decrease is expected in 2013 and 2014. Oberg admitted to being perplexed by the unexpected fall, but expressed optimism that the reason was the way his prisons were executed. “We certainly hope that the efforts we invested in rehabilitation and crime relapse prevention have had an impact,” he said.
“The modern prison service in Sweden is very different from when I joined as a young prison officer in 1978,” says Kenneth Gustafsson, governor of Kumla prison, Sweden’s safest prison, 130 miles west of Stockholm. However, he did not believe that the system had softened. “When I joined, attention was very focused on humanity in prisons. Prisoners were treated well – perhaps too well, some might say. But, after a series of high-profile leaks in 2004, we had to rebalance and put more emphasis on security.”
Despite the tightening of attitudes towards prison security following the escape scandals, the Swedes still managed to maintain a broadly humane approach to sentencing, even for the most serious offenders: prison sentences rarely exceed 10 years; those who receive life imprisonment may still apply to the courts after a decade for commutation for a fixed term, usually in the region from 18 to 25 years. Sweden was the first country in Europe to introduce electronic labelling of convicted offenders and continues its efforts to minimize short-term prison sentences, wherever possible, using community-based measures, which have proven to be more effective in reducing recidivism.
The overall rate of recidivism in Sweden is between 30% and 40% in three years; compared to another European country, the figure is about half that of the United Kingdom. A probable reason for the relatively low recidivism rate and the low incarceration rate in Sweden (below 70 per 100,000 inhabitants) is that the age of criminal responsibility is set at 15 years. In the United Kingdom, for example, children aged 10 to 17 and young people under 21 have the highest recidivism rates: nearly three quarters and two thirds respectively. A good proportion of these criminals are going to populate adult prisons. In Sweden, no young person under the age of 21 can be sentenced to life imprisonment – this is not the case in many other countries – and every effort is made to ensure that as few juvenile offenders as possible end up in prison.
One of the main reasons for the decrease in the number of prisoners could be the amount of post-prison support available in Sweden. Probation insurance – a government agency – has the task not only of supervising those on parole, but also of providing treatment programs for offenders with drug, alcohol, or violence problems. The service is assisted by about 4,500 lay supervisors – members of the public who volunteer to be friends and support criminals under supervision.
Gustafsson talks about broader goals and objectives for the Swedish Department of Justice: “In 2013 and 2014, the priority of our work will be with young offenders and men with convictions of violent behavior. For many years we have been running programs to help drug addicts. We are also now developing programmes to address behaviours such as aggression and violence. These are the important things for our society when these people are released.” I spoke to a former prisoner who now runs a social enterprise called X-Cons Sweden. Peter Soderlund served almost three years of a four-year sentence for drug and weapons offences before being released in 1998. He was helped by a newly formed organization run by former prisoners named Kris (Return of Criminals to Society).
“The big difference between Kris and us is that we’re happy to let people who are still taking medication for addiction join us,” he says. Both organizations work with the same objective: to help prisoners successfully reintegrate into society after their release. And what is life like for the prisoner in Sweden? “When I was inside, I got lucky. In Osteraker prison, where I served my sentence, the governor was enlightened. They treated us well. But I knew that not all Swedish prisons were like this. I met so many people there who needed help – after receiving help from Kris, I knew I wanted to help others. With X-Cons, we find them at the door and support them in accommodation and offer a support network.”
“In Sweden we believe a lot in the concept of rehabilitation, without being naive, of course,” says Gustafsson. “There are some people who are not going to change or cannot change. But, in my experience, most prisoners want to change, and we must do what we can to help facilitate it. It is not always possible to achieve this in a single prison sentence.
“In addition, it is not only prison that can be rehabilitated, it is often a combined process, involving probation and a larger society. We can provide education and training, but when they get out of jail, these people need housing and work.”

Subject: Support for Judy
Dear Karl,
I got a call from Judy a couple of days ago to discuss some of the problems she was having and I thought I'd give you a heads-up on what was said, as you're the leader of Judy's project team.
Judy really enjoys working with you and the team and finds the project very interesting, but I think she feels a little lost and struggling to see the overall picture. It seems that you have been given a good deal of autonomy to carry out the tasks you have given you, and of course this level of delegation is not uncommon in your branch. But I believe in her Tokyo office, she's used to a little more direction and management guidance, and she's also finding this international project rather discouraging.
When I asked her about meeting her deadlines, she mentioned that due to recent changes in the timeline of the project, her goals have moved, and she doesn't really seem to understand why this has happened. Considering that he also faces simultaneous deadlines from his Tokyo department, we can assume that he might feel a little stretched.
Looking forward, I wondered if we could make it easier for Judy to offer her more direction when she sets up her tasks, at least until she learns the ropes and gets used to working unsupervised. I think I would also appreciate it if you gave him a clearer idea of how his role in the team fits into the overall picture of things. Do you think maybe you could sketch out the group and individual goals at your next team meeting and that way, everyone doesn't just get a reminder of the ultimate goal, but every team member, including Judy, could have a more holistic view of the whole project?
I was also thinking that I could help touch the base with her every once in a while to make sure she's up to date with any changes in the overall attack plan. In the meantime, I'll write to your manager at the Tokyo office and see how aware they are of the deadlines you've given him, and if somehow they can review their responsibilities and coordinate their tasks so that he doesn't feel constantly dragged in both directions.
Judy is an extremely conscientious worker and is eager to contribute positively to the team. Personally, I think she is someone with high potential and will be an asset for our international projects if she is properly targeted. I am interested in knowing your thoughts on the subject and am open to any suggestions on how we could best support Judy for a smoother sailing experience on the team.
Greetings.

"A lonely old man who lives in a crater on the moon is the unlikely focus of John Lewis' 2015 Christmas announcement, as department stores take a beneficial turn in their latest multimillion-dollar campaign.
Amid the surge in season advertising by John Lewis, which has come to mark the start of the Christmas shopping season for many, department stores will try to use their profile to raise hundreds of thousands of pounds for Age UK. It will also encourage staff and customers to join their local charity branch to care for older people who might otherwise be alone during the holiday.
The retailer has spent £7 million on a campaign ranging from the television ad to a smartphone and merchandise game, including bright pajamas in the dark, as well as covered areas such as the surface of the moon in 11 stores.
After two years of successful advertisements with tender animals – a bear and a hare, then a penguin – this time, the retailer is pulling the strings of the heart with a story of a young girl, Lily, who sees an old man living in a hut on the moon through her telescope. The particular child tries to send him a letter and shoot a note through bow and arrow, before floating a gift from a telescope tied to balloons, which finally allows them to make contact.
The clipline of the ad is: “Show someone you love this Christmas,” echoing Age UK’s own campaign: “No one should have anyone at Christmas.” The benefits of three products – one cup, gift label and card – will go to charity.
“Charity really resonates with people at this time of year and the announcement lends itself to thinking of someone who lives on their street who might not see anyone,” said Rachel Swift, marketing director at John Lewis.
The campaign features the Oasis Half the World Away track reinterpreted by the little-known Norwegian artist Aurora.
The announcement costs £1 million to make. The lunar scenes were shot at Warner Bros Studios, where Harry Potter's films were made, and the specially built set was created by one of the teams behind the latest Star Wars movie, The Force Awakens.
As in recent years, John Lewis has aroused interest in his latest ad with a teaser campaign on television and social media using the hashtag #OnTheMoon. There will be a full moon on Christmas Day 2015 – a complete coincidence, according to Swift.
In 2014, the retailer also spent £7 million on a campaign with a realistic animated penguin and a young man playing John Lennon’s Real Love son together, sung by British singer-songwriter Tom Odell. In the first week of January, before the 16.6m that marked Sainsbury's announcement with World War I soldiers sharing a chocolate bar, the next most popular announcement in the UK in 2014.
Swift said that, despite the hype, John Lewis had followed the same strategy for the past five years. “It’s all about a thoughtful little gift and going to the extra mile for someone you love at Christmas,” he said. “We don’t go into it thinking, ‘This is going to be huge’, just get something right for the brand at this time of year and something we hope customers really like.”
Sarah Vizard, news editor of the commercial magazine Marketing Week, said John Lewis seemed to have slowed down his efforts this time, with a smaller key presence in the stores despite a growing army of competitors. “There are certainly many more brands making Christmas announcements this year, but I think many of those brands that tried to compete with John Lewis doing something emotional and creative have come back to what you can buy at the store,” he said. “John Lewis still makes the emotional piece the best. This campaign is another great way to put that in a way that will resonate with customers. I think people will think it’s really nice.”
Among those fighting for attention in the flood of Christmas commercials was sister network Waitrose, who launched her online Christmas ad on social media before a television debut during The X Factor. He used the agency that has created John Lewis' Christmas ads for years.
Burberry has released what is just his second festive film, with Romeo Beckham and Elton John, while the Currys electric network wrote on Jeff Goldblum for their first dedicated Christmas ad. Asda, Lidl and Morrisons also launched their campaigns in early November.
Marc Bolland, executive director of Marks & Spencer, who also launched his Christmas announcement in early November, said that, in the first week of September, the most sought-after term on his website was Christmas.
Boots, another retailer who launches his holiday campaign in early November, is returning to a more traditional approach after a critical announcement in 2014, which featured a family that goes long distances to meet at Christmas.

"The approval by the House of Representatives of a comprehensive bill on health care foreshadows a difficult ongoing struggle for President Obama and his fellow Democrats to get a bill in the Senate and in the law.
The House voted 220-215 at the end of Saturday, with 39 opposing Democrats and one Republican in favor, to approve what would be the largest expansion of health coverage since Medicare was created more than 40 years ago.
The U.S. Affordable Health Care Act, or H.R. 3962, restricts insurance companies from denying coverage to anyone with a pre-existing condition or charging higher premiums depending on gender or medical history. It also provides federal subsidies to those who cannot afford it. And it guarantees coverage for 96 percent of Americans, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office.
But turning the bill into law remains uncertain. The Senate must now pass its own version of a health bill, and Senate majority leader Harry Reid of Nevada last week pointed out uncertainty as to whether that will happen this year.
Once both chambers have passed a bill, a congressional conference committee will merge the two proposals into a consensus version that would require final approval by each chamber and Obama's signature.
On Sunday, Obama praised the historic vote of the House of Representatives to pass the bill and asked the Senate to take the baton and complete its work.
For years, we have been told that this cannot be done, Obama said, citing decades of failed health reform efforts. Last night, the House proved to be different.
The president described the support of many members of the House for the heated and often misleading rhetoric surrounding this legislation as courageous.
It is now up to the U.S. Senate to take the baton and bring this effort to the finish line on behalf of the U.S. people, Obama said. And I'm absolutely sure they will.
However, Republicans and an independent senator who sits with the Democratic caucus said Sunday that difficulties remain for Obama at his top domestic priority.
Senator Joseph Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut, reiterated that he would join a Republican filibuster against a health bill if it contains a government-run public health insurance option after the House's amendment process.
Speaking on Fox News Sunday, Lieberman called the controversial public option, which is in the House of Representatives bill and Senate version being prepared by Reid, an unnecessary provision aimed at bringing government-run health insurance into the future.
If the public option is there, as a matter of conscience, I will not allow the bill to reach a final vote, Lieberman said. He has previously said that he did not oppose the opening of the Senate debate on the bill despite the provision of public choice, and maintained that position on Sunday.
Lieberman's stance is crucial because the Democratic caucus has a minimum of 60 votes to overcome a Republican filibuster. Senate Republicans unanimously oppose the public option, although Maine Senator Olympia Snowe has launched the possible idea of compromise for an activation mechanism that would order a public option in the future if thresholds for expanded coverage and lower costs are not met.
The only Republican in the House who supported the bill, Representative Anh Joseph Cao, told CNN on Sunday that he put the needs of his district over the desire of his party.
The vote in favor of Cao ended up being unnecessary for House Democrats, but gave House President Nancy Pelosi license to support the two parties to the controversial move.
“I felt that last night’s decision was the right decision for my district, even though it wasn’t the popular decision for my party,” said Cao, a top-notch representative of the traditionally Democratic 2nd District of Louisiana. Many of my constituents have no insurance, many of them are poor. It was the right decision for the people of my district.
Cao acknowledged that he drew some promises from the White House to help his district deal with the continuing effects of Hurricane Katrina in exchange for his vote. Asked about the reaction of the Republican comrades, Cao said that party leaders respect my decision, and I respect theirs.
Also on Sunday, Indiana representative Mike Pence, the House's third-ranking Republican, said on the Fox program that Democrats were ignoring the wishes of the American public by pushing through the huge health law.
Pence said the health care bill would increase costs, increase deficits, and lead to a government takeover of the health care system.
I think the American people are deeply frustrated with the liberal establishment in Washington, Pence said. If the Democrats continue to ignore the American people, their party will be history.
Democratic Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland responded on the same program as the Congressional Budget Office reported that the bill would reduce the deficit.
Van Hollen rebuked Republicans for not facing the rising costs of health care that harmed the U.S. economy during the years that controlled the White House and Congress.
We have had a great system for insurance companies, Van Hollen said, citing the big profits of the industry as Americans face what he called unfair practices, such as having coverage denied by pre-existing conditions. This is a message to the American people; we are trying to reduce their costs to help more Americans pay for health insurance.
The House voted less than an hour before midnight on Saturday was full of drama. With eight seconds in the voting period, the Democrats began counting down and burst into roars when Pelosi declared, “The bill was passed and the hammer hit.”
Republican legislators stood silently on the ground, some with arms folded in their chests.
Well, it was about what I thought it would be, said Republican House leader John Boehner of Ohio as he came out quickly.
He later issued a statement saying that the $1.2 trillion legislation would increase the country's debt.
“I came here to renew the American dream, so that my children and their children will have the same opportunities as me,” Boehner said. I came here to fight the monstrosities of the great government like this bill that attenuate the light of freedom and diminish opportunities for future generations.
Michael Steele, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, published an equally smooth statement.
Nancy Pelosi and her liberal lieutenants made many promises today to get the votes they desperately needed, she said. Make no mistake: the guarantees of the Democratic leadership were based on political expediency, not on principle. Anyone who receives a promise from Pelosi will be disappointed in the end when their vows are no longer needed.
Earlier that day, Obama met behind closed doors with Democrats to support the bill, calling it an opportunity for a generation.
In the run-up to the vote, conservative Republicans and Democrats joined forces to pass an amendment to the bill to ban federal funds for abortion services.
It was considered a great victory for them and for the Conference of Catholic Bishops of the United States, which used its power, especially with conservative Democrats in Congressional swing districts, to help force Democratic leaders to allow a vote on the amendment.
The ban, introduced by Democratic members, including Indiana representative Brad Ellsworth and Michigan representative Bart Stupak, would exclude rape, incest, or if the mother's life is in danger.
The Republican Party represented 174 of the votes in favour of the amendment, with a Republican vote present.
On the Democratic side, 64 voted in favour of the measure, and 194 voted against.

"The noise emanating from passing ships can disturb animals such as killer whales and dolphins much more than was thought, with new research demonstrating that the communication of animals and their ability to find prey could be hampered by the underwater din. The roaring under passing ships has long been connected to the disturbance of large whales. But American researchers have documented persistent noise that also occurs at medium and higher frequencies, including 20,000 Hz where killer whales, also known as orcas, hear better.
These sound disturbances may be hindering the ability of killer whales to communicate and eco-localize – the process of using sound to bounce off objects such as prey and identify where they are. Dolphins and porpoises, which also operate at higher frequencies, may be suffering from the same problems. The findings suggest that noise may well affect the endangered population of killer whales near the waterways. A population of only 84 killer whales feed on the U.S. west coast. and Puget Sound.
“The main concern related to this is that even a slight increase in sound can make ecolocation more difficult for whales,” said Scott Veirs of Beamreach, who led the investigation. “That is worrying because its prey, Chineseok salmon, is already quite scarce. Listening to a click of a salmon is probably one of the most challenging things a killer whale does. Listening to that subtle click is harder if there’s a lot of noise around you.”
The researchers used underwater microphones to measure the noise created by some 1,600 individual ships as they passed through the Haro Strait in Washington State. The two-year study captured sounds made by 12 different types of ships, including cruise ships, container ships and military vehicles, which passed through the Strait about 20 times a day.
Some ships are quieter than others, but the average noise intensity next to all ships was 173 underwater decibels, equivalent to 111 decibels by air – on the sound of a strong rock concert. Whales are generally not located right next to boats and would therefore be subject to noise from about 60 to 90 decibels – around the level of a lawn mower or vacuum cleaner.
Veirs said scientists have already identified the impact of underwater noise on whales – a kind of fauna that contains the largest animals on Earth. But the new investigation highlights the threat posed to smaller whales, dolphins and porpoises. “The ships have been considered as sources of low frequency noise, such as the noise of trucks or trains,” he said. “Most of the noise is at that low frequency, but the ocean’s background noise rises even at high frequencies. This could be causing a major problem that we need to investigate further.”
There are several consequences of a noisy marine environment. Whales may have to group more closely in order to be heard. And, if they don't find prey with the same effectiveness, they'll have to use their excess fat reserves. This is problematic, as this fat often contains artificial contaminants that are toxic to whales if they are completely released into their systems.
Veirs said more work needs to be done to identify how bad the noise is affecting the whales and also to calm the ships that pass near the cetaceans. “It should be easy to reduce noise pollution,” he said. “Military ships are a little quieter and there could be direct ways to transfer that technology to the commercial fleet. Another way to reduce noise is to slow down. The decrease in speed by six knots could decrease the intensity of noise by half.”
While the fortunes of some whale species, such as humpbacks and blue whales, the largest mammal on Earth, have improved as whaling has decreased, others continue to be threatened by a number of factors. The U.S. federal government has recently protected nearly 40,000 square miles of the Atlantic in an attempt to avoid losing the North Atlantic right whale, a species with only 500 individuals left.
In Europe, killer whales carry dangerously high levels of banned polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) chemicals in their fat. Scientists are still trying to determine whether the contaminants caused the death of five sperm whales stranded on the east coast of Britain in January 2016. Meanwhile, around the coast of Australia, whales face a growing threat from ship attacks and oil and gas drilling, as well as Japan's recent promise to resume whaling in Antarctic waters.

"The Statue of Liberty, possibly one of the most emblematic symbols of New York City, is a popular tourist attraction for city visitors for the first time. This 150-foot monument was given to the United States from France to celebrate 100 years of U.S. independence. The statue is located on Liberty Island, and is accessible by ferry from Battery Park in New York City or Liberty State Park in Jersey City.
When Claire first visited the Statue of Liberty, she instantly admired it as a symbol of freedom. Claire made sure to make reservations before her visit because only 240 people are allowed to climb the ladder to the top of the statue every day. After climbing almost 400 stairs, Claire received spectacular views of the city from the crown of the statue.
During her visit, Claire learned that the Statue of Liberty was not always the color it is now. She discovered that because the exterior of the statue is made of copper, the statue rusted over time, giving it the greenish appearance it has today. When it was first built, the statue was the same color as a bright penny!
After visiting the Statue of Liberty, Claire spent the rest of the day in New York City visiting other important monuments and historical monuments. Claire left New York in the hope of having had time to explore more sites, but she cannot wait to return to the city in the future.",C1
"Writing in Nature magazine, former president of the Royal Institute of Navigation Roger McKinlay argues that our reliance on GPS technology (global positioning system) is out of place and could be eroding our innate search skills. “If we don’t appreciate them, our natural navigation skills will deteriorate as more and more depend on smart devices,” he wrote.
McKinlay believes that a major investment will be needed before navigation systems are good enough to allow technologies such as autonomous vehicles to take off. Meanwhile, he argues, we need better research on navigation systems, while children should be encouraged to learn to find their way through more traditional means. “Schools should teach navigation and map reading as life skills,” he wrote.
According to Ofcom (Communications Office), about 66% of adults in the UK owned a smartphone in 2015, compared to 39% in 2012, making GPS technology widely available. But McKinlay, a satellite communications and navigation consultant, believes we should be careful to leave our navigation needs to our devices. “Navigation is an ability to use or lose it,” he wrote.
Although few scientific studies have explored the topic, 2009 research supports the notion. “What we did was look at a group of current London taxi drivers and a group of London taxi drivers who had been retired for about four years,” said neuroscientist Dr. Hugo Spiers, head of the Spatial Cognition Group at University College in London, who is the author of the study. The results showed that retired taxi drivers behaved worse in navigation tests than those still at the wheel. “We have been able to show that their skills are gone if they were not using their knowledge in that particular test.”
Spiers also believes that there is a danger of relying on technologies such as GPS, but it is quick to point out that the greatest risk lies in users being unintentionally driven to dangerous situations. Among the deaths attributed to Satnaves (satellite navigation devices) was the death of a driver who, in 2010, sank in a reservoir in Spain. “There is a real potential risk of relying on a satellite,” Spiers said. “But the real risk to health of not using your brain effectively is not known.”
The way navigation technology is used could also affect its impact on our own skills, Spiers says. While audio instructions for drivers eliminate the need to think about navigation, he says, the use of smartphone applications such as digital maps is very different. “In the old days, you had to print or take a map of A to Z in your pocket – what we’re doing now is just the use of computer-assisted information and you’re having to think really hard about where you’re going and interact with this device,” he said. “Modern technology is not just completely cheating on us.”
McKinlay remains convinced that navigation technologies have a long way to go before futuristic scenarios involving driverless cars and smart cities become reality. “For really critical applications – security applications such as aircraft landing or navigation aircraft – GPS is still not good enough,” he said.
Although Spiers believes that the development of artificial intelligence based on machine learning could lead to a new wave of navigation aids, McKinlay remains skeptical. “We’ll see more and more intelligent machines that are very, very task-specific, but the big breakthrough will be when they’re able to tune into what you might be thinking and what you might be wanting to accomplish,” he said.
Ultimately, McKinlay believes, it is essential that human beings continue to be able to take control of their navigation. “Do you really want to encourage people to reach a point where, when they disappear or when the battery flattens, they are in total shock and can’t do anything?” he said. “Technology is not magic, it’s just a tool.”

"A Lufthansa Jumbo aircraft almost collided with another plane at John F. Kennedy International Airport on Monday after an EgyptAir flight apparently headed its way just as the plane fell down the runway, according to air traffic controller tapes.
The near loss was captured on audio recordings, revealing an air traffic controller communicating with the Lufthansa pilot, shouting ""Cancel takeoff!"" Cancel takeoff plans! while the two planes were moving towards each other.
The Lufthansa plane pilot acknowledged that the plane stopped.
Lufthansa Flight 411, an Airbus 340 full of 286 passengers and crew, was authorized to take off by air traffic control shortly before 7 p.m. on Monday, according to a statement by the spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration Kathleen Bergen.
EgyptAir Flight 986, a Boeing 777, was instructed to take a taxi from the ramp area to the airfield for departure.
The plane was instructed to turn in another taxi, but instead it was direct, the statement said.
A spokesman for EgyptAir said the flight was delayed 40 minutes because Lufthansa's departure was delayed.
The plane did not move until the tower issued the authorization, spokesman Mohamed Rahma said.
After a brief inspection at the door, Lufthansa's flight continued on his flight to Munich, Germany, and arrived safely, according to Lufthansa's spokesman, Martin Riecken.
The FAA is investigating the incident.

"Gary Johnson and Virgil Goode have no chance of winning the November 6 presidential election, but the two third-party candidates could have an impact on who.
Together, Johnson of the Libertarian Party and Goode of the Constitutional Party are in a position to draw a few thousand votes from Republican Mitt Romney and perhaps President Barack Obama in some of the few battlefield states considered to be at stake and therefore decisive in determining the winner.
Goode, a former Democratic congressman who became a Virginia Republican known for an anti-immigration stance and other strongly conservative policies, usually won more than 120,000 votes in his home district in elections from 1996 to 2008.
If this time only receives 10% of that support, it could be enough to balance what is currently considered a death-even race for the 13 Virginia election votes to Obama.
Gary Johnson: A Uphill Battle to Catch a Wave, Win the Presidency · Global Voices
Virgil Goode is a wild card, particularly in Virginia, said Stuart Rothenberg of Rothenberg's Political Report, adding that it could be a factor even if he wins only a handful of votes.
A similar scenario involves Johnson, New Mexico's former Republican governor, in other states considered too close such as Colorado, Nevada and New Hampshire, said Wendy Schiller, professor of political science at Brown University.
The three states, with a total of 19 electoral votes, are known to independent voters, he said, quite a few of which might be inclined to support a Libertarian rather than Romney.
In Nevada, a CNN/ORC International survey last month showed Goode gaining 4% support and Johnson 3%, with Obama maintaining a 47% to 44% advantage over Romney in the state. Based on the 2008 participation in Nevada, support for Goode and Johnson would amount to some 67,000 votes.
The president of the Republican National Committee Reince Priebus reduced the impact of third-party candidates earlier this month, telling CNN that Johnson's candidacy was almost a non-factor.
Could Obama’s struggles with white voters cost him the election?
Voters will not throw their vote overboard when we have an election here that is about the future of America, Priebus said. I don't see that happening.
CNN polls show that support for Obama and Romney changes little when third-party candidates are taken into account in state careers, CNN voting director Keating Holland said.
In all the states that CNN has polled so far, candidates from smaller parties are not receiving more than 4% of the vote, and usually closer to 1% -2%, Holland said, noting that including them does not change the margin between Obama and Romney. Statistically speaking, it is difficult to make the case that minor party candidates are affecting race.
The influence of third-party candidates has fallen dramatically since Texas billionaire Ross Perot won almost 19% of the vote in 1992, provoking conservative anger for hurting current Republican President George H.W. Bush's chances of re-election against Democrat Bill Clinton.
Eight years later, Green Party consumer activist and candidate Ralph Nader won 2.8 million votes, including more than 94,000 in Florida that secured the loss of Democratic Vice President Al Gore to Republican George W. Bush in the state by 537 votes.
Despite the fact that the votes for third party candidates fell sharply in the recent elections, this year’s tenacious race between Obama and Romney makes even split support for others potentially decisive in a key state, and hence election.
Who's awake? Take a look: CNN Voting Center
If the race is close enough, 100 votes can matter, said Scott Rasmussen, president of the electoral company Rasmussen Reports. This year's fierce race competition means fewer undecided voters and fewer people choosing a third-party option, he said, adding: It's not a Ross Perot year.
Goode rejects any hint that he seeks to play a saboteur role, saying that his policies would be better for the country than those of Obama or Romney.
If he managed to win, he would shake Washington that an average citizen would be president instead of someone who is backed by super-PACs, he recently told CNN.
Johnson describes himself as more liberal than Obama on social issues and more conservative than Romney on fiscal matters. She says same-sex marriage is a constitutional issue and should be legal, supports the legalization of marijuana use, and also says it would abolish the Internal Revenue Service.
For Schiller, Johnson represents a potential threat that should concern Romney's campaign.
I think it can be argued that Gary Johnson will deviate from Romney's votes, he told CNN, arguing that hardcore conservatives who consider the former governor of Massachusetts too moderate could opt for the Libertarian.
Do the Calculus: CNN Election Map
If Colorado approaches, I think it will matter if Johnson is in the race, Schiller said, pointing out that 1,000 or 2,000 Romney votes -- makes a difference.
To counter that dynamic, Romney's campaign must argue that a vote for Johnson is the same as voting for Obama, according to Schiller.
Every time you have a third game in a very tight race and that third candidate looks a lot more like Romney than Obama, then if you're Romney, you have to discredit that candidate, he said.
However, Johnson's campaign told CNN in September that part of the candidate's support came from former Obama supporters in Colorado, New Mexico, and Nevada.
By running for the Libertarian Party, Johnson hoped to get the support of the relatively small but fiercely loyal supporters of Ron Paul, the Texas congressman who has failed in three offers to win the Republican presidential nomination. So far, the vote suggests little progress for Johnson in winning over Paul's supporters.
A poll by NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist earlier this month in Virginia showed that 1% of likely voters -- about 38,000 according to state participation in 2008 -- supported an unspecified candidate other than Obama or Romney. Most of that support seemed to come from younger voters who were strongly liberal or moderate, a population closer to Obama's base.
Obama could be injured by two other minor party candidates -- Jill Stein of the Green Party and Rocky Anderson of the Justice Party -- but both are considered far less likely to get enough support to undermine the president.
A national CNN/ORC survey at the end of September showed Stein at 3% compared to 4% for Johnson, while Goode and Anderson had negligible support. However, Stein did not register in CNN/ORC surveys in recent weeks in Florida and Nevada, and obtained 1% support in Ohio compared to 3% for Johnson.
According to Schiller, the possible apathy of the disillusioned liberals with Obama's first term helped motivate the president's campaign to organize a major effort to boost participation both in early voting and on election day.
I think they understood that they had to take people who would definitely vote for Obama to the polls, period, without hesitation or indecision, he said.
CNN's Holland warned against assuming that supporters of third party candidates changed their opinion of a major party contender.
Supporters of smaller parties often fall into that category because they don't like the party's two main candidates, he said. So in a hypothetical world where the race was only between the party's two main candidates, many smaller party voters would have stayed home.
The other candidates, the other debate

"Maybe no other name in daytime variety shows brings more excitement than Jerry Springer. Springer has been the host of an interview program for several years on the show named after him, the Jerry Springer Show. His program is described as a tabloid talk show due to the controversial topics covered, and due to the people appearing on the program. Springer doesn't invite celebrities to his show. Instead, he chooses to show regular Americans from all walks of life. He is a former politician who served as mayor of the city of Cincinnati, Ohio, in the 1970s.

His show debuted in 1991 as a political talk show, where he invited celebrities like Oliver North, and Reverend Jesse Jackson. The program was designed to mimic another popular day interview program, Phil Donahue's program. The show found a moderate success, but in 1994, to increase the ratings, the show became a more sensational format. In this new format, everyday people faced family and friends on controversial issues.
The program has been highly qualified for decades, but it has also been attacked by many groups who claim that the topics are not appropriate for daytime television. Springer doesn't get away from any topic. Guests face issues such as adultery, prostitution, homosexuality, and belonging to hate groups. Often, these clashes become violent, where guests participate in physical clashes. Springer's show has generated numerous copycat shows over the years, but still surpasses all other shows of its kind.
In May 2000, the controversy reached the program when a guest on Springer's show was killed by her ex-husband after watching the episode. Springer, his producer, and the network were sued by the woman's children. The suit alleged that the controversial nature of the series led to the murder, although the lawsuit was eventually withdrawn.",C1
"It's a skillful production with a nefarious goal: A 55-minute video released by ISIS, praising its victories and warning the United States to stand in the way of its goal of creating an Islamic caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria.
It's propaganda, say terrorism experts. A recruitment video aimed at English speakers.
But the American intelligence community is focused on a jihadist who appears briefly at the end of the video. The ISIS fighter, who speaks perfect English with an American accent, shows himself orchestrating the mass execution of a group of men.
It's too early to know if this militant comes from North America, or maybe spent some time there, or what his exact story might be.
But the intelligence community is already analyzing the video in an attempt to identify the man's origin, an American official told CNN. “It is too early to say where your dialect is,” the official said.
In the video titled Flames of War, the jihadist appears for the first time speaking Arabic in a classical dialect and with the ease of a native Arabic speaker, said Paul Cruickshank, CNN terrorism analyst.
But the ISIS fighter, who is masked and wearing a camouflage uniform, seamlessly changes to English. There are a number of men digging a ditch behind him. The jihadists claim that they are Syrian soldiers assigned to a 17th Division military base near the Syrian city of Raqqa, and that now, after an ISIS attack, they are digging their own graves in the same place where they were stationed.
CNN cannot independently verify that the men in the video were soldiers, as the propagandistic video claims.
How the Islamic State Runs From Oil to Decapitations
The video shows a group of militants who execute the men, who fall into the ditch.
The man who committed this atrocity in cinema could be an Arab who was educated in the West. Or it could be American or Canadian. If so, Cruickshank said, he would be the first American jihadist to commit a war crime on camera.
ISIS clearly had a calculated step to put this guy on camera, said Frank Cilluffo, a security analyst at George Washington University. Why? Because he looks American. The message is addressed to a Western audience.
The intention, CNN Cilluffo said, is to project fear of Americans and project power.
The Difference Between ISIS and Al Qaeda
Intelligence officials will sift every detail of man's voice, looking for clues from a particular dialect that can lead researchers to local communities to look for additional clues, Cilluffo said.
The United States will also compare the clues of jihadist language to see if it is consistent with those individuals who are known to have gone to fight for ISIS.
The video is certainly propaganda and a piece of recruitment for the terrorist group, Cruickshank said. But it is also a warning to the West that if it engages in the struggle, it will be a hard way out for foreign troops.
The video does not exactly incite the United States and the West to launch attacks against ISIS, but those appearing in the video try to convey a sense of harshness, Cruickshank said.
The video glamorizes ISIS, according to SITE Intelligence, which monitors terrorist groups.
It serves not only as a powerful piece of recruitment, but a stern warning to their opposition to the flames of war against them by the fighters, according to an SITE summary.
ISIS, ISIL or Islamic State?

"In recent months, Americans have experienced numerous extreme weather-related events, including droughts, forest fires, and heat waves.
We have witnessed the warmest spring since the search began in 1895.
Thirty-one states reached record temperatures.
The period between July 2011 and June 2012 was the hottest of the 12 months recorded.
And last year 14 extreme weather-related events caused an incalculable loss of human life and cost the U.S. economy more than $55 billion. Understandably, many Americans wonder if these events are manifestations of a longer-term change in the climate.
At present, we cannot definitely link any extreme events to climate change. But it is worth considering whether the apparent increase in some extreme events has roots in a larger and longer-term trend, as that would predict a continuation of these events in the future.
That kind of understanding can be of practical importance because it can inspire action to reduce economic losses and human suffering â $ often in relatively simple ways. For example, if a region is likely to continue to have heavier rains than it has historically been, then it is wise for city planners to consider installing higher storm drains when the time comes to replace the ageing infrastructure.
Science in this area is getting stronger. In a recently published study, six international research teams led by NOAA scientists and several countries investigated seven extreme climate events in 2011. In six of the seven, there was sufficient evidence to conclude that climate change caused by human activities played a factor in events that affect their severity, probability, or frequency.
News: Extreme Time -- Prepare to See More Of It
Among those events exacerbated by climate change were heat waves in Texas and Oklahoma, drought in East Africa and extreme temperatures in Europe and England. On the other hand, the study found no evidence that the devastating floods in Thailand last year were related to climate change.
Another new peer-reviewed article, the 2011 climate status report compiled by nearly 400 scientists from 48 countries, documents some of the longer-term trends underlying some of these changes. The Committee concluded that:
- Carbon dioxide and other major greenhouse gases continue to increase, the annual global average for 2011 being the highest to date;
- Excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is making the oceans more acidic;
-- The Arctic is warming approximately twice as fast as the rest of the planet, and its sea ice is thinning dramatically;
-- And the average global heat stored in the upper ocean was the highest since records began in 1993.
These surprising trends have important implications for climate, climate and environment and human health.
An upward trend is indisputable: at NOAA, requests for climate data have skyrocketed, and these data are increasingly helping stakeholders to cope with extreme events. Last year, for example, firefighters in Texas used long-term climate information to prepare for the 2011 spring/summer forest fire season. Emergency managers along the Mississippi, Missouri and Red River basins used NOAA climate data to help reduce flooding months before it started.
Coastal managers are using sea-level data to protect crucial infrastructures.
Businesses and governments rely on climate information to make smart investments.
Power utilities have climate data to anticipate maximum power requirements and distribute energy where necessary.
These are the types of practical actions that inspire me in my work as we work to put the best science available to understand and reduce the impact of extreme events on families, communities and businesses. These and other measures are essential for reducing the effects of extreme weather events and forging a safer future.
The views expressed in this commentary are only those of Jane Lubchenco.

"Under Christmas trees all over the world, plots of underpants and underpants are waiting to be opened -- perhaps with a tinge of consternation -- by men in your life.
Underwear is a great batter on the traditional holiday gift list and now football stars are entering the market.
James Rodriguez, star of the Colombia World Cup, became the last footballer to face brand underwear, launching his J10 collection for Bronzini last month and posing semi-naked to show off the products offered.
The 23-year-old was at the head of his Portuguese team-mate from Real Madrid, Cristiano Ronaldo, whose underwear brand CR7 recently celebrated its first anniversary.
David Beckham's pants reached the high streets in about 40 countries when the former master of LA Galaxy and Manchester United partnered with the Swedish fashion store H&M in 2012.
Even though he's approaching 40, that's 17 years older than rival Rodriguez, Beckham took off again this summer to model his products.
But why do footballers choose to branch their brand in the most intimate way?
Christmas comes once a year, but footballers are in the store window continuously, Steve Martin, the global CEO of the M&C Saatchi Sport and Entertainment agency, told CNN.
Underwear is a purchase every day and the use of right underwear has seen it become something of a lifestyle item.
For some of the main players, it is a natural extension of their individual brand.
They don't need the money. It is not a matter of greed, but of making the most of its true value during the short period of its career.
Martin helps manage the brand and marketing of Ronaldo's CR7 range, which says it is available in nearly 100 countries -- its main markets are in southern Europe, Asia and South America -- as well as online.
Ronaldo's luxury suits cost $36 a pair of underpants with a price of $30, but it also has a basic line where the pants are $30 and underpants are $17.
The main audience -LSB- for the CR7 range -RSB- are football fans who aspire to Ronaldo's image and appearance, Martin adds. The age range is mainly 18-24 years and slightly older.
Ronaldo's beauty is that he goes through a great demography.
The aesthetic appeal of Ronaldo, Rodriguez and Beckham is an undeniable factor in the reason his underwear is punched.
Beckham stopped the traffic as a underwear model for Emporio Armani before collaborating with H&M while perfectly manipulated Ronaldo gleams style in and out of the field.
Rodríguez may still be a baby face, but he is already winning awards for his appearance, voted the sexiest man in the world in 2014 by People magazine of Spain.
When this handsome trio launched his underwear collections, he appealed not only to football fans, but also to his gifts buying wives, girlfriends and mothers.
I'm sure H&M chose David Beckham because he's a very attractive and fit guy, Seth Stevenson, Slate's senior writer in New York, told CNN.
They also chose him because he is attractive in many different places. He is famous in Asia, is known in the United States and is married to Victoria Beckham.
He's got some profile all over the world and they have stores all over the world.
Celebrities are a popular advertising gambit because people are interested in celebrities and like to do what they do.
The pioneer of the celebrity underwear market was not, however, a footballer, but the Swedish tennis ace Bjorn Borg.
After his sudden withdrawal from the game in 1983 at the age of only 26 years, the 11-time champion of great slam singles served another winner by releasing his brand of undergarments homonymous in 1984.
The company now sells about five million underwear items in its male and female ranks each year and is stored in 20 global markets.
The name Bjorn Borg is a very strong part of this success, says marketing and communications manager Jonas Lindberg Nyvang.
He's still involved in coming to the office, he's informed about what we're doing, and he's still part of the process.
Borg's elegant appearance, such as those of Beckham, Ronaldo and Rodriguez, certainly helped him take a walk in the underwear market, but maintaining a successful brand for 30 years depends on more than a superficial appeal.
Sports stars possibly make natural underwear manufacturers because they understand more than most about the importance of comfort on the road.
If you have the right underwear you feel more confident in court or out of court, explains Nyvang. It is important for sports performance.
At Bjorn Borg we focus on the perfect fit and we are also very aware of fashion. We put on underwear that makes people feel more active and attractive.
But before you dream of finishing a Nigel de Jong thong or a pair of Neymar panties for your loved ones, keep in mind that it takes a certain kind of star to earn money from underpants.
You're talking about one time, Martin says. There's probably only a handful of global sports stars who can try something like this.
For every Ronaldo there are thousands and thousands and thousands of footballers who do not earn a thousandth of what they do.
Stevenson agrees that true sports icons have a better chance of successfully creating a line of products that is not directly connected to their main business, but that even then there could be well falls.

Language Number of people learning the language Number of native speakers Number of countries where the language is spoken
English 1.5 billion 527 million 101
French 82 million 118 million 51
Chinese 30 million 1,390 million 33
Spanish 14.5 million 389 million 31
Italy 8 million 67 million 29
Japan 3 million 123 million 25
The table illustrates some interesting facts about some of the most popular languages in the world to learn. It allows comparisons between the number of people who study a language and those who speak it as a mother tongue, and shows how many countries have speakers of each language.
The prominence of English is surprising. 1.5 billion people are learning English, compared with only 82 million studying the second most popular language, French. English is spoken in 101 countries, about twice as much as French and three times more than Chinese. English is the only language with more students than native speakers.
In terms of native speakers, Chinese is the most spoken language, more than double the English language with 1.390 million. It is the third most popular language to learn with 30 million students. Spanish has more than five times more native speakers than Italian, but proportionally fewer students at 14.5 million for Spanish and 8 million for Italian. As for Japanese, it is the least studied language for 3 million pupils.
In general, more people are learning English than the other combined languages and English is spoken in the largest number of countries. However, Chinese has the largest number of native speakers. There seems to be little correlation between how many native speakers there are from a language and the number of students, but there is a stronger link between the number of students and how many countries have speakers.",C1
"A common benchmark in the United States to determine when a driver is legally drunk is not doing enough to prevent alcohol-related accidents that kill about 10,000 people each year and should become more restrictive, transport safety researchers say.
The National Transportation Safety Board recommended on Tuesday that all 50 states adopt a blood alcohol content - LRB- BAC-RRB- cut of 0.05 compared to the standard 0.08 in today's books and used by law enforcement and courts to process drunk driving.
Most Americans think we've solved the problem of poor driving, but in fact, it's still a national epidemic, said NTSB president Deborah Hersman.
The idea of a stricter standard is part of a safety board initiative outlined in a staff report and approved by the panel to eventually eliminate drunk driving, which accounts for about one third of all road deaths in the United States.
NTSB Seeks Technology to End Drunk Driving in the U.S.
Hersman said that over the years progress has been made to reduce drunken driving, including a series of federal and state policies, stricter law enforcement and greater defense. But he said too many people are still dying on American roads.
The board recognized that there was no silver bullet, but that more action was needed at the federal and state levels.
Over the past 30 years, more than 440,000 people have died in this country due to alcohol driving. What will be our legacy in 30 years? Hersman asked. If we don't tackle alcohol driving now, when will we find the will to do so?
Lowering the rate to 0.05 would save about 500 to 800 lives a year, the safety board said.
Under current law, a 180-pound male will typically reach the threshold of 0.08 after four drinks for an hour, according to an online blood alcohol calculator published by the University of Oklahoma. The same person could reach the threshold of 0.05 after two to three drinks during the same period, according to the calculator.
Supreme Court delivers sentence against police in case of drunk driving
Many factors besides gender and weight influence a person's blood alcohol content, and many states prohibit lower levels of driving intoxication.
NTSB investigates transport accidents and advocates safety issues. It cannot impose its will through regulation and can only recommend changes to federal and state agencies or legislatures, including Congress.
But the independent agency is influential in public safety matters and its decisions can stimulate the action of legislators and transport agencies with related ideas across the country. States establish their own BAC rules.
The board also recommended Tuesday that states expand widely laws that allow police to quickly confiscate drivers' licenses that exceed blood alcohol limits.
And it's pushing for laws that require all criminals for the first time to have ignition blocking devices that prevent cars from starting until breath samples are analyzed.
In the early 1980s, when grassroots safety groups drew attention to drunken driving, many states required a BAC rate of 0.15 to demonstrate intoxication.
But over the next 24 years, Mothers Against Drunk Driving and other groups pushed states to adopt the 0.08 BAC standard, the last state to fall online in 2004.
Meanwhile, the number of alcohol-related fatalities on roads decreased from 20,000 in 1980 to 9,878 in 2011, according to NTSB.
Drunk driving blood tests divide the Supreme Court
In recent years, about 31 percent of all fatal road accidents were attributed to alcohol deficiency, NTSB said.
I think.05 is coming. How long it takes to get there, we don't know. But it will happen, said Robert Molloy of NTSB, who helped guide the staff report.
For some, the vote came close to home.
Robert Sumwalt, a member of the NTSB board of directors, pointed out that one of his relatives had been murdered by a drunk driver and another was serving a 15-year sentence in a related death.
Many of the recommendations are going to be unpopular, Sumwalt said. But if we keep doing what we're doing, we're not gonna make any difference.
NTSB cited an investigation that showed that most drivers experience a decrease in cognitive and visual functions with a BAC of 0.05.
Currently, more than 100 countries on six continents have BAC limits set at 0.05 or less, the safety board said.
NTSB has asked all 50 states to do the same.
CDC: Adolescent consumption and driving rates are halved
A restaurant trade association, the American Beverage Institute, attacked the main recommendation, saying that the average woman reaches 0.05 percent BAC after consuming a drink. The group said it based this conclusion on a chart that said it was used by car safety regulators in the National Road Traffic Safety Administration (LRB-NHTSA-RRB).
But NHTSA told CNN on Tuesday that it no longer uses that graph as there are many variables that contribute to an individual's level of intoxication. A new NHTSA table shows a person with a level of 0.05 BAC experiences reducing coordination, reducing ability to track moving objects, steering difficulty, -LRB- and -RRB- reducing response to emergency driving situations.
A commercial group in the beer industry said it would examine NTSB's recommendation to lower the blood alcohol threshold.
However, we strongly encourage policymakers to direct their efforts to where we know we can achieve results: focusing on repeat offenders and increasing penalties for those with BAC of -LRB-0.15 -RRB- or more, said Joe McClain, president of the Beer Institute.
The safety board also recommends that NHTSA provide financial incentives to states to effect changes.
NHTSA, which oversees road safety as a federal regulator and analyzes traffic accident data, said it would work with any state that wants to look for a lower BAC standard to gather more information about that approach.
At Tuesday's meeting, the security board also defended laws that allow the police to confiscate a driver's license at the time of arrest if the driver exceeds a BAC limit, or refuses to take the BAC test.
Some 40 States already use the administrative tool, which NTSB considers effective because it is fast and immediate.
And the board recommended a more widespread use of passive alcohol sensors, which the police can use to smell air during a traffic stop to determine the presence of alcohol.
The sensor is able to detect alcohol even in cases where the driver has tried to disguise his breathing with chewing gum or mints. If the sensor alerts, it is a reason for more thorough testing.
NTSB recommended last December that states require ignition locks for all DUI offenders and said states should improve interlock compliance.
Tuesday's recommendations were scheduled to coincide with the deadliest alcohol-related accident in U.S. history. On May 14, 1988, a drunk driver drove his truck on Interstate 71 near Carrollton, Kentucky. The truck hit a school bus, killing 24 children and three adults. More than 30 people were injured.

"You can be Aagot, Arney or Ásfríður; Baldey, Bebba or Brá. Dögg, Dimblá, Etna and Eybjört are fine; so are Frigg, Glódís, Hörn and Ingunn. Jórlaug works well, like Obba, Sigurfljó, Urania and – if you wish – Vagna. But you can't, as a girl in Iceland, call yourself Harriet.
“The whole situation,” said Tristan Cardew, with a very British euphoria, “is really pretty silly.” With his Icelandic wife, Kristin, Cardew is appealing against a decision by the National Registry in the capital Reykjavik not to renew the passport of his ten-year-old daughter Harriet for not recognizing her first name.
Since the record does not recognize Harriet's 12-year-old brother Duncan's name either, the two children have so far travelled in passports that identify them as Stulka and Drengur Cardew: Girl and Boy Cardew. “But, this time, the authorities have decided to apply the letter of the law,” said Cardew, a British cook who moved to Iceland in 2000. “And that says that no official document will be issued to people who do not have an approved Icelandic name.”
The impasse meant that Kópavogur's family was at risk of losing their vacation in France until they asked the British embassy for an emergency British passport, which should now allow them to leave.
Names matter in Iceland, a country of just 320,000 people, whose phone book lists subscribers by their first name for the very sensible reason that the vast majority of Icelandic surnames simply record the fact that you are the son or daughter of your father (or mother). The offspring of Jón Einarsson, for example, could be Ólafur Jónsson and Sigríður Jónsdóttir.
The Act provides that the names of children born in Iceland, unless both parents are foreigners, must be submitted to the National Registry within six months of birth. If they do not appear on a recognized list of 1,853 women ' s names and 1,712 men ' s names, parents must apply for approval from a body called the Icelandic Name Committee.
For the approximately 5,000 children born in Iceland each year, the committee receives about 100 applications and rejects approximately half under a 1996 law aimed primarily at preserving the language of the sagas. Its requirements include that the names given must be “able to have Icelandic grammatical endings”, cannot “confront with the language structure of Iceland” and must be “written in accordance with ordinary Icelandic spelling rules”.
What this means in practice is that there are outside names containing letters that do not officially exist in Iceland’s 32 - letter alphabet, such as “c. ” Similarly, names that cannot accommodate the terminations required by the nominative, accusative, genitive and dative cases used in Icelandic are also systematically rejected. “That was the problem with Harriet,” Cardew said.
The country’s designation laws have been subject to increasing fire in recent years: in 2013, Blær – “Light Breeze” – Bjarkardóttir Rúnarsdottir won the right to be officially known by name, rather than “Chica”, when a court ruled that denying it was a violation of the Icelandic Constitution. Former mayor of Reykjavik, Jón Gnarr, has also called the Icelandic name law “unfair, stupid and against creativity.”
Cardews could solve Harriet's problem by giving him a middle Icelandic name. “But it’s a little late for that and too dumb,” Cardew said. “Are you saying you don’t want us here?”",C1
"How far are we from a world where drones deliver packages? If you believe in Amazon, not far away. Others are not so sure: technical progress past this point is not simply a matter of invention; it is a matter of public safety.
Paul Misener, Amazon's vice president of global public policy, recently said in a congressional hearing that his company would be ready as soon as all the rules were in place, but Misener gave no clue as to what that would look like beyond joking with a congressman who had a fresh fruit basket on the way to his door to prove the viability of technology.
The Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) will finally have regulations governing the commercial use of unmanned aircraft by June 2016. But technology has a long way to go before then and larger machines are not legal at all yet – only drones of up to 25 kg will be covered and the FAA points out in the proposed rules that, if you are going to pile the skies with radio-controlled flying robots, it will be better for everyone to use different radio frequencies that no one can jam or hijack. Professor Sajiv Singh of Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute, who runs a “critical cargo delivery” company called NearEarth, said piloting a state-of-the-art drone was a little more like leaving a trail of breadcrumbs: go to this altitude, do this short task, go home. But even short flights from a mobile landing platform pose serious logistical problems, he said.
“They are not proposing to deliver from an uninhabited place to another uninhabited place; they are proposing to deliver from a warehouse to where the consumer is, which is probably an urban area or a suburban area,” he said. “In such particular cases, there will be dangers along the way that the vehicle will have to detect. Maybe there'll be land that the map doesn't know, unless you've mapped that exact route before. Even then, maybe there's construction equipment that wasn't there but it's there now. Perhaps the GPS signals are blocked or partially blocked, in which case you will have an incorrect idea about where it is.” All this is overcome, he said – but it is difficult. A major problem is to maintain radio contact with a drone and plan what happens if that contact breaks. “If you have an unmanned aerial vehicle, it will go ahead and hit the ground,” said the robotics Daniel Huber.
That is not a difficult problem to solve for an engineer; it is just that the solution is not yet an industry standard.
In addition, “you can’t do everything with a 25 kg plane,” said Jay McConville, director of business development for unmanned defense systems and contractor Lockheed Martin MST. Much of Lockheed Martin's focus has been on making drone driving interfaces less as elaborate flight simulators. “Those of us in the airplane business have to remind ourselves that the operator doesn’t really care about every little thing about the plane and instead wants to focus on the final result,” he said. “Operators want to see the vehicle’s status information; they want to watch video on their portable device or laptop.” “Technologyally, most of the things that are needed for this are in place,” Huber said.
He is working on a program that proposes the use of drones to inspect infrastructure – pipes, telephone lines, bridges, etc. “We have developed an scanning algorithm where you draw a box around an area and it will fly autonomously around that area and look at each surface and then report.”
Huber, senior scientist at the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute, where he works on 3D systems images, said regarding a program like Amazon: “I’ve heard them say that many packages are lightweight – a drone can take a kilogram for 15 minutes. If you have a vehicle that can go to a neighborhood, you can deliver from that base. It takes a distance of 15 minutes and the typical drones off the platform have that distance.” It is one way, he said, to make sure that the surrounding population is relatively safe. “The bigger you get, the more dangerous you get.” Logistical problems are in the middle of being solved in some very dramatic ways, Huber said. At a recent conference, he said, a disaster relief drone firm, SkyCatch, demonstrated a robot that could take off autonomously and, when tired, land at its own loading station. “It would land and take off and, when it ran out of batteries, land, exchange batteries and take off again,” he said.
Of course, security remains a major concern – Singh points out that, for a commercial plane to be considered skyworthy, it has to demonstrate a rate of serious failure every 1m hours. The drones, he said, are “one or two orders of magnitude far away” from that point of reference. The Reaper drone has a failure in 10,000 hours, Singh said. An oil leak, by the way, does not count as a catastrophic failure – something has to fall from the sky. “We’re closing the gap,” Singh said. “There’s a lot of interest.”
Part of this is simply that air travel is inherently dangerous and therefore the rules are much higher. “If you fly commercial airlines, they will often say, ‘Oh, a component has failed – we have to go back to the door,’” Singh said. “And that is an established industry with 60 years of legacy! It thrills me to think that one of these things could fall on a busy road.” Part of the solution, Singh said, is a simple contingency planning: “If things fail, the vehicle has to do something reasonable.”

"Seven-Eleven killed the minibar.
The feelings of a Hong Kong hotel manager could well be extended to hotels around the world.
The hotel minibar, loved and cursed by millions of desperate midnight snacks/drinks, is in decline.
Hilton Hong Kong installed the world's first hotel minibar in 1974 with liquors and refrigerators in each of its 840 rooms.
The measure reportedly resulted in an increase of 500 % in the sales of beverages per room service and an increase of 5 % in the company’s net revenue that year.
Soon, the minibar became an almost universal industry standard.
But Hilton recently began to reverse some of its properties, removing alcohol and leaving refrigerators in its rooms, so that guests would fill up.
Other hotel giants, such as the Grand Hyatt, Starwood and Marriott brands, are also gradually eliminating this feature that was once omnipresent in the room of some of their properties.
It's because we don't seem to enjoy them as much as we once did.
TripAdvisor recently published a survey that found that the minibar was the least popular among all hotel amenities; only 21% of respondents found the room fridge an important feature compared to 89% who wanted a free wireless connection.
PKF Hospitality Research found that in the United States, revenues from mini-bars, which account for only 1% of total hotel revenues, decreased by 28 % between 2007 and 2012.
Robert Mandelbaum, director of research information services at the firm, says that properties in the United States have adapted their food and beverage offerings, installing food outlets that resemble mini-markets.
The tendency to eat comfortably is also contributing to a decrease in the hotel's traditional restaurant serving three meals a day, he says.
They are being replaced by casual food outlets that offer items like pre-packaged salads.
Everything is part of what Mandelbaum calls the Starbucks phenomenon, a philosophy of design and property management that allows and encourages interaction among strangers.
Combine this with the appearance of millennials sociables who prefer to mix in the hotel lobby rather than order room service, and you have an industry and the consumer move away from inbibing in the room.
Is this something that bad?
For those who think that inflated prices on items like small bags of macadamia nuts and mediocre chocolate bars are offensive, especially when nearby convenience stores offer the same stuff for a fraction of the price, the room bar has always been an irritant.
Simon Dell, vice president of operations at ONYX Hospitality Group, based in Thailand, agrees.
We don't want to sell mini-macadamia nuts for $8.50. It's not what people want, he says.
In addition, by removing minibars from rooms, hotels can save costs, says Dell.
When -LRB- we -RRB- remove any contents from the minibar you need a considerable number of tasks of each -LRB- housekeeper -RRB- day, so there is time saved, head account saved, therefore the money saved, which is reflected in the overall price -LRB- of the rooms -RRB-, says.
Better for a property to focus on the amenities that guests prioritize, such as Internet access.
Connectivity is as pervasive as the phone 20 years ago, when it had to be in the room, or as your own shower or bathroom has to be in the room.
$10 Coca-Cola isn't right.'
Others think that the minibar simply needs to evolve to the changing needs of guests.
We can't just give hot and cold running water, says Dean Winter, Chief Operating Officer at Hong Kong Hotels & China Projects at Swire Hotels.
Take the example of the property of Swire in Hong Kong, Upper House -- each room has a courtesy selection -LRB- beer, soft drinks, healthy juices, coconut water and snacks -RRB- and an independent and paid wine fridge.
We wanted to differentiate ourselves to attract the most demanding business and leisure travelers without following the traditional five-star hospitality routes, explains Winter.
He believes that charging $5-10 for Coca-Cola is not the right thing to do, as people are still aware of prices.
People appreciate a free minibar or Wi-Fi or movies, and paying a fee and not all of these supplements, he says.
Less hard drink
Today there is much less hard liquor, courtesy or not.
Ten years ago, JW Marriott took the small bottles of liquor out of its billable mini-bars at his Hong Kong hotel, citing low consumption.
In The Mira Hong Kong, miniature spirits were phased out in 2011.
According to the property, hard liquor was eliminated as we preferred to tempt our guests with drinks and entertainment in our outdoor lounge bar Vibes, and cocktail bar Room One with a live band.
Only corporate or high-paying guests receive the minibar completely free of charge.
Cheap wins are convenient
The minibar is also increasingly part of an all-inclusive package.
At the Ovolo Hotel in Hong Kong, the courtesy plan is extensive: guests receive a free minibar, breakfasts and two-hour free alcoholic beverages at their O Lounge, including all liquors and wine.
Eliminating prices has also helped eliminate the headache of arguing with guests about exactly what they did or did not consume, says the hotel manager at the Ovolo branch office in Aberdeen, Chum Roa.
He was a source of many disputes in hotels, he says. If the customer persists he had nothing, hotels often absorb the cost of not ruining relations with guests about the minibar items.
Now, he doesn't have to deal with that.
Roa imagines a future in which the traditional minibar is extinguished.
The competitor of the minibar is not nearby hotels, but the 24-hour shops where you can get everything you need just a few blocks away, he says.
The convenience of drinking a cold drink in your room is not enough if you have to pay three times more for it, it seems.
Will you miss the minibars in the hotel rooms or say goodbye to beer at amazing prices and M&M's? Leave a comment.

"Senator Tim Kaine said Wednesday there is no legal authority for the current U.S. mission against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.
We have been involved in a war, not an imminent defense of the United States, without legal authority, said the Virginia Democrat at the Wilson Center on Wednesday, before a panel discussion on the legal authority for military intervention, moderated by CNN's Jim Sciutto.
The mission is not covered either by the wording or by the intention of the 2001 and 2002 authorizations for the use of military force, as argued by the White House, Kaine said, adding that such an argument is ridiculous and inconsistent with the previously declared interpretation of AUMF by President Barack Obama.
Kaine, a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, has proposed a new and limited authorization, specifically for the current mission against ISIS. He said that we should address it immediately, stressing that it could be achieved at the Congressional session.
Rand Paul on the ISIS response: This war is now illegal '
It is also calling for changes in the Resolution of War Powers that will result in a better process for the authorization of war.
In a statement last week, Kaine said she was encouraged by Obama's recent willingness to work with Congress on a new authorization, but also concerned about today's suggestions that Congress should wait until the next session of Congress in 2015 to take this vote.
We have already asked too many American military to risk their lives without a political consensus behind this mission, he added.
What to expect from the pathetic Congress
The current AUMF was approved in 2001, a few days after the September 11 attacks. Although the language of the authorization covers only military action against those who planned, authorized, committed or assisted the terrorist attacks that occurred on 11 September 2001 or hosted such organizations or individuals, in recent years it has been used to cover the action against any group or individual that the administration considers associated with Qaeda.
A second authorization for the use of military force against Iraq was approved in 2002, allowing the President to defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq and to enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning Iraq.

"On an average day its outlets are a hive of social activity, which welcomes everything, from business meetings to reading groups looking for this important morning caffeine fever. But Starbucks must be careful what he wants.
The UK Uncut direct action group plans to convert dozens of coffee empire branches into day-care centers, shelters and homeless shelters to highlight chain tax evasion tactics.
The announcement of the action comes on the day a Starbucks executive faces questions from the House of Commons Committee on Public Accounts about why the company did not pay any corporation tax in the UK for the past three years, despite the fact that the U.S. senior management preached the company's profitable operations in Britain.
In his appearance before the committee, the financial director of Starbucks, Troy Alstead, will attempt to repair the reputation of the company, which continues to suffer due to the controversy.
Parliamentarians accused HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) officials of having friendly relations with large companies. Speaking of arrangements with Starbucks, conservative MP Richard Bacon said: “It smells bad. And it doesn’t smell like coffee, it smells bad.”
The UK Uncut campaign group is trying to establish a link between government cuts, particularly those affecting women, and tax avoidance by multinational companies.
Sarah Greene, British activist Uncut, said funds for shelters and rape crisis centers faced cuts unless companies paid their fair share of taxes. HMRC estimates that around £32 billion were lost due to tax evasion in 2011.
Greene said the government could easily bring in billions that could fund vital services by suppressing tax evasion.
The group, which became prominent after organizing a sit-in at Vodafone, Topshop and Fortnum & Mason stores, turned its attention to Starbucks last month after a Reuters investigation found that the company had paid only £8.6 million in corporate taxes since its launch in the UK in 1998, despite accumulated sales of £3 billion.
Anna Walker, an independent and long-standing campaigner, said: “We have chosen to really highlight the impact of the cuts on women. So there's going to be a real focus on transforming Starbucks into those services that are being cut off by the government... [like] shelters and day care centers.
“Starbucks is a great target because it’s on every high street in the country and that’s what UK Uncut really finds important: people can take action in their local areas,” he said.
Several international organizations have faced criticism of their UK accounts, with Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Google and Ikea all paying little or no corporate taxes despite large British operations.
However, according to YouGov’s BrandIndex surveyors, Starbucks has suffered the deepest damage to his image.
The chain of cafes insists that it pays the right level of taxes. The group’s chief executive, Howard Schultz, said in a statement: “Starbucks has always paid taxes in the UK despite recent suggestions to the contrary.
“In the last three years alone, our company has paid more than £160 million in various taxes, including contributions to National Insurance, VAT and business fees.”
Margaret Hodge, who chairs the Public Accounts Committee, told parliament last month that Apple, eBay, Facebook, Google and Starbucks had avoided nearly 900 million pounds of taxes. Prime Minister David Cameron responded to the statement by saying: “I am not happy with the current situation. I think [HMRC] needs to look at it very carefully. We need to make sure that we are encouraging these companies to invest in our country as they are, but they should also be paying fair taxes.”
A spokesperson for Starbucks said: “Although the issue of tax law can be extremely complex, Starbucks respects and complies with accounting laws and standards in each of the 61 countries where we do business, including the UK, a market we remain committed to in the long term. We have posted the facts about our tax practices in the UK on our website.
“Starbucks’ economic impact on the UK goes far beyond our [employee] stores and partners. We spent hundreds of millions of pounds with local suppliers on milk, cakes and sandwiches, and on store design and renovations. Taking into account the indirect employment created by Starbucks' investments in the United Kingdom, the company's expanded economic impact on the British economy exceeds £80 million a year.
“We hope UK Uncut respects the well-being of our partners and customers, and recognizes the value we add to the economy, creating jobs and learning, as well as paying our fair share of taxes in the UK.”

"Each of us spent an average of three years of our lives sitting in them, King George II of Britain died while in his in 1760 and 2.5 billion people still do not have access to one.
The humble bath is the unlikely theme of the world celebration on Monday, as one of the most essential inventions in the world, but without which many people still struggle.
Although many of us tend to take ours for granted, activists expect World Bathing Day 2012 to draw attention to what they call the global sanitation crisis, with more than a third of people around the world living without a clean and private place to go.
This means that one in three people still have to defecate outdoors, using fields or bushes, rivers, railway lines or roads, or simply a plastic bag. Others use unhealthy latrines or buckets loaded with diseases and smells.
Most of those who do not have access to toilets live in sub-Saharan Africa or Asia, and more than half of the Asian population does not have adequate sanitation, according to the United Kingdom-based charity WaterAid.
Ajara lives in a marginal neighborhood in the city of Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh Province, India. He told WaterAid how people in his community have to defecate on a nearby hill.
There are no trees and privacy right now and so we have to wait until night to go there. It's hard for older people to go and it's hard to go at night. It is also difficult for adult girls because of the risk of sexual assault, Ajara said.
On World Bathing Day, international aid agencies are highlighting the particular risks for women of poor access to toilets. WaterAid says women are more vulnerable because they are not only exposed to disease, but also have additional shame, harassment, and risk of attack when they go outdoors.
Sandimhia Renato in Mozambique described to WaterAid how he has to cross a very dangerous bridge every time he goes to the bush to defecate.
I think it takes 15 minutes to get to the bridge, says Renato. I come here once a day, between 4 pm and 5 pm. At night it's very dangerous. People die. A woman and a child were killed with knives. A woman I know has been raped.
But it is not only the shame and inconvenience of not having a private place to go to the bathroom, but a major public health problem.
When one gram of stool is considered to contain 10 million viruses, one million bacteria, one thousand parasitic cysts and one hundred worm eggs - LRB- according to UNICEF -RRB- you can see why outdoor defecation is so damaging to the health of a community. Without a sewage system to eliminate human waste and make it safe, cholera, typhoid and other infectious diseases spread rapidly.
The United Nations says that more than 2.7 million people die each year from lack of sanitation. With diarrhoeal diseases killing more young children in developing countries than HIV/AIDS, malaria and measles combined, it is the second leading cause of death in children under five, according to the World Health Organization.
Addressing it, says the World Bank’s Water and Sanitation Program, is extremely cost-effective. Poor sanitation is estimated to cost African countries about $5.5 billion a year and $53.8 billion is lost in India due to related economic impacts.
The study of the program in 18 African countries found that even the time it takes people to find a discreet place to use the toilet represented almost $500 million in economic losses. That is before examining the cost of medical care, premature deaths, and days of work lost due to the illness.
In fact, according to the organization of World Bathing Day, every dollar invested in sanitation produces a return of five dollars. Its message is that the solution to the global sanitation crisis lies not in any miraculous technological breakthrough, but in stronger political leadership and a commitment to invest in sanitation and education infrastructure.
Mahatma Gandhi for one seemed to recognize the value of the toilet for humanity when he said sanitation is more important than independence. Campaigners for World Toilet Day will be waiting for these words to resonate with today's leaders.

"Nikolay Davydenko produced a relentless demonstration to defeat the US Open champion. Juan Martin Del Potro in straight sets to win the final of the ATP World Tour in London on Sunday.
Davydenko had sent Roger Federer to the world number one in the semifinals and played the magic to see the 6-3 6-4 Argentine in an hour and 23 minutes at the O2 Arena.
The victory in the elite, eight men at the end of the season is the highlight of the race of the 28-year-old Russian, going one better than 2008 when he lost in the final to Novak Djokovic of Serbia.
Davydenko, sown sixth, had begun the week with an exciting three-set defeat against Djokovic in the round-robin game, but proceeded to accumulate four consecutive wins, culminating in his emphatic victory over the fifth ranked Del Potro.
He was worth $1.5 million and was delighted to have captured the first major trophy of a race marked by consistency, but above all in a role supporting the game's elite.
It was amazing for me to come here number seven and win the tournament. I surprised myself, he said.
Del Potro seemed tired after his epic three-set semifinal victory over the Swedish Robin Soderling the night before.
He left his service in the fourth opening set ganme and could claim only five points in his opponent's service as the Russian eased himself to an early advantage.
The second set was tighter, with Del Potro having a break point in the sixth game.
But in 4-4 Davydenko made his move in the service of Del Potro.
Two beautiful shots established three resting points and gained a 5-4 lead after a long rally.
It served for the title, set the match point with an ace and took it when Del Potro could not return a fiece stroke.
He ended a week of surprises in the new place with the second world championship Rafael Nadal colliding with three straight sets defeats and home hope Andy Murray moved away from the round-robin of Federer and Del Potro by the thinnest margins.
Soderling, who only entered the tournament as a late reservation for injured Andy Roddick, and Davydenko were the other group's surprise qualifiers, with the latter going all the way after beating Australian, French, U.S. Open and Wimbledon champions.
Del Potro acknowledged that he had been beaten by the best man in the day.
Congratulations. You're a great champion, he said.
Now Davydenko will see his first grand slam title at the Australian Open in January, which will be the next major round of the tournament for major players.
Previously, in the doubles final, Bob and Mike Bryan won Max Mirnyi and Andy Ram 7-6 6-3 to win their third ATP final title and claim first place in the world at the end of the season for the fifth time.

"Camping is a popular way for many people in the United States to spend their holidays. Camping involves people who leave the comfort of their home and drive to spend a few nights or more in the open air.

When people camp, they can sleep in a tent, in a caravan, or if they want to be extravagant, they can sleep in a cabin. Some people really like to ""take it"" and don't use shelter except a sleeping bag and sleep under the stars. Some people drive through the U.S. in what is known as a recreational vehicle or RV, which is a trailer. Inside there are beds, a small bathroom and a kitchen.
There are campsites all over the United States. These are places where campers gather and usually pay a fee to set up a tent or place a caravan in a designated outdoor location. Many of these campsites have water hoses and electrical connections so that people can wash dishes and themselves and connect a radio or their computers. Most campsites also have a fire ring or moat, which is a hole in the ground where people can make a safe fire to roast marshmallows, a popular camping activity. Usually there is also a picnic table for people to eat their meals. Many of these campsites also have shared bathrooms with showers. Some campsites have playgrounds, swimming pools and playrooms. Some also organize activities for people who like singing, where people will gather and sing songs. It is usually illegal to camp in an undesignated official campsite, which means you can't just put a tent in a forest.
When people go camping they often do other outdoor activities such as fishing, canoeing, hiking, kayaking, swimming, horse riding and mountain biking.",C1
"Himalayan lakes, space walks, and presidential primaries helped Scott Kelly keep his wits for 340 days in space, the astronaut told reporters, after landing again on Earth from a search mission. “It seemed like I lived there forever,” Kelly said. The veteran of past missions said that his greatest surprise was simply how long this one felt. “Perhaps, from time to time, you go crazy,” he said.
Kelly and a Russian counterpart, Mikhail Kornienko, spent almost a year at the International Space Station (ISS) to study the effects of weightlessness, radiation and narrow space flight rooms on human beings – research that NASA considers essential for a possible mission to Mars.
Kelly said the duration of the mission was her greatest challenge and that she felt significantly more pained when she returned to gravity than after shorter trips. Kelly and her twin brother, Mark, a retired astronaut, have spent the last year doing physical and mental tests. The tests will continue, to help NASA learn about how the body copes with the severe tensions of space flight.
Kelly said she was in pain and had extremely sensitive skin, but so far, her balance has felt mostly decent. However, he said, “the first thing I tried to put on a table that I missed” because “you tend to underestimate the effects of gravity.”
He said that the discomfort of returning to gravity, which reduced it to normal height after stretching 1.5 inches in orbit, did not take away anything of the astonishment he felt after his capsule landed again on Earth. When the Russian capsule opened to the fresh air of Kazakhstan, Kelly said, it smelled “a fragrance like a plant that flourished in that area.” It was the fresh air mixed with the charred smell, “a little sweet” of a spaceship that had survived the reentry through the atmosphere.
As he moved away from the ship, he said, the scope of the mission began to sink in: 340 days at a 15-year space station that is “a million pounds, the size of a football field, the internal volume, some say, of a six - bedroom house. ” The ISS, he said, is a place that uses the power of the sun and was built with the help of an international team and millions of contributors.
“There are things we’re going to discover about our space experience at the space station that we don’t even know now,” Kelly said, comparing research on more than 450 missions there with the work done by computer scientists at NASA in the 1960s and 1970s. He added, “The sight is great, too.”
Kelly made the most of that view, posting spectacular photos on the social networks of Earth's cities, landscapes, oceans, and atmosphere. “The Earth is a beautiful planet,” he said, describing the striking colors of the waters around the Bahamas and the colors of the rainbow of lakes dotting the northern Himalayas. He said he would like to visit that region, although first he would have to learn “which country really owns them”. But, “predominantly, you can see how thin the atmosphere is, how fragile it looks,” Kelly added. “That, combined with these large swathes of pollution, is a little alarming.”
The astronaut said he could see entire pollution systems: clouds of forest fire smoke covering parts of the US, sections of Asia with continuous and visible pollution almost all year round. He said that the message “we need to save the planet” lost the point a little: “The planet will improve; it is we who will not be here because we will destroy the environment.” The thin shield of the world’s atmosphere “makes you more environmentalistic after spending so much time looking down,” he said.
“It is for us to take care of the air we breathe and the water we drink. And I think we have an impact on that and we have the ability to change it, if we make the decision to do so.” Kelly's active social media life, which she said was a joint effort with her girlfriend, earned her a huge online follow-up. But he said he didn't know, instead he was seeing the chaotic drama of the 2016 presidential election. One of the first questions he asked the crew who pulled him out of a space capsule was “How was the Super Tuesday?”
But the astronaut died when asked about his thoughts about Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. “I would say that, as a government employee, I am subject to the Hatch Act,” he said, referring to a law that prohibits any political activity for federal employees. “So I can’t say how I think about all the news all year round.”
In addition to the news, he said, constant work helped him stay sane: “I tried to have milestones that were near, like when the next crew arrives, the next spacewalk, the next robotics, the next scientific experiment. That made a difference to me, keeping my sanity.” Being back on Earth with the rest of humanity had not completely sunk, he added, recalling how surprised he had been to see a multitude of people after a previous mission. “There will be a point here very soon where I will begin to feel that kind of cultural shock,” he said.
Although a NASA scientist said Kelly embodied the qualities needed for a mission to Mars, the astronaut himself predicted that he would not fly with the space agency again. “But I don’t think I would ever say I’m absolutely 100% done,” he added, pointing to the sudden successes of private space flight companies like SpaceX. “They might need a guy like me someday,” he said. “Perhaps, in the next 20 years, you can buy a cheap ticket, you just have to go visit yourself a little.”

"One of the most controversial figures in the history of the United States of America was Dr. Jack Kevorkian. He was a pathologist, an advocate of euthanasia and author, who came to fame in the late 1990s. He died in 2011. Kevorkian firmly believed in euthanasia for the terminally ill. He designed a suicide machine that helped 130 people end their lives. Kevorkian was pursued throughout his career as a suicide facilitator, and was convicted in 1999 for his involvement in assisted suicide. He served eight years in prison, and was released in 2007 after agreeing not to continue helping with anyone's suicide.

Kevorkian had difficulty working as a pathologist at the University of Michigan, where he obtained his doctorate. He disagreed with his employers, and decided to leave the hospital to pursue his own interests. In 1987, Kevorkian bought advertising space in Detroit newspapers as ""killer."" His first known assisted suicide was for a 54-year-old woman suffering from advanced Alzheimer's disease. Kevorkian was not charged in the case because Michigan did not have a law in force on assisted suicide. The state filed murder charges initially, but those charges were dropped. The Michigan Medical Board, however, stripped Kevorkian of his medical license.
Kevorkian defended himself in subsequent trials by claiming that he did not take any action to help his patient's suicide. He had invented a machine that was designed to be operated by the patient using the machine. Therefore, Kevorkian argued that he had no hand to cause the death of his patients. His patients had complete control of suicide from start to finish. Kevorkian's role in the deaths was simply to help connect his patients to his machine. The rest is up to them. Some called Kevorkian an angry madman who lost his mind, while others called him an angel for helping to put an end to the suffering of his patients.",C1
"An international agreement to improve security in Bangladesh's garment factories faces the threat of legal action, as factory owners demand compensation for the cost of closures and repair work. With some repair programs that are expected to take months, factory owners say they cannot afford the costs of paying staff while factories are closed, along with the costs of some major works needed to ensure the safety of buildings. The renovations of the building are taking place following the collapse of the Rana Plaza complex in the capital of Bangladesh, Dhaka, in 2013, in which 1,138 people died.
The problems arise as hundreds of garment factories in Bangladesh are inspected monthly for fire safety and structural problems under the Agreement on Fire Safety and Buildings in Bangladesh, which is supported by over 170 international brands, including Primark and Marks & Spencer, and international trade unions, including IndustriALL.
The owner of a factory based in Dhaka, Softex Cotton, has threatened legal action against the Agreement after its factory was shut down due to structural problems, prompting a lawsuit for a $100 million report in compensation.
Another factory owner, who refused to be named, said that once a factory closed its doors, even for a few months, it would lose orders and close permanently: “There is no such thing as temporary closure,” he said. The factory owner said the agreement had “discalced” around the issue of who paid for the factory closures in the midst of efforts to get as many brands as possible to sign an agreement following the Rana Plaza disaster. He said there was no clear process to manage the costs involved.
Jenny Holdcroft, policy director at IndustriALL, who has been closely involved in the Agreement, said the agreement ensured that factories would not lose orders during the closure because brands had committed to keeping orders with suppliers for two years.
While 12 factories have so far been identified by the Agreement as requiring significant work, Holdcroft said that many of them only needed partial closure to reduce stress in the building so that production could continue on other floors. The Agreement also legally obliges brands to ensure that workers receive remuneration during factory closures. He said that details of who would make the payments had been left open to ensure that all factory owners who could pay repairs and compensation to workers made the necessary contribution.
“This was always going to be a negotiation issue. Brands do not want to commit themselves to paying for the owners of the rich factories that have just pocketed the profits and have not been spending in their factories for years to continue doing so. Obviously there was going to be an interruption. If there were no interruptions, there would be no change,” he said. A spokesman for the Agreement said that negotiations on payments and even legal actions would not delay their work to improve safety in factories.
However, pressure on the Agreement to contribute to the payment of posted workers has increased after a rival factory security group backed by U.S. retailers, including Walmart and Gap, the Bangladesh Workers Security Alliance, set aside $5 million to help pay factory workers for a period of up to two months while working in buildings that it has identified as requiring improvements. To date, it has identified five factories in four buildings where production had to be suspended.
“The Alliance is sharing workers’ wages with employers, so there is now a lot of confusion. We had a big meeting with the Agreement to make them understand that they have to come forward or how are we going to help our workers?” said Shaidullah Azim, director of Bangladesh’s Association of Clothing Manufacturers and Exporters.",C1
"Chemical dispersants continue to flow into the Gulf of Mexico at virtually unchanged levels despite the Environmental Protection Agency's order to significantly reduce blood pressure, according to a CNN analysis of the daily dispersal reports provided by Deepwater Horizon Unified Command.
When the May 26 directive was issued, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said the use of dispersants should be reduced by 75 percent.
Public statements made at that time by the EPA administrator gave the impression that federal officials were trying to reduce the use of dispersants in general.
We hope to see a substantial reduction in the total amount of dispersant used, Jackson said in May.
Before May 26, BP used 25,689 gallons per day of the chemical dispersant Corexit. Since then, CNN analysis shows that the daily average use of dispersants has fallen to 23,250 gallons a day, a decrease of 9 percent.
Environmentalists on the Gulf Coast say it's another sign that federal agencies monitoring dispersal use are not being tough enough with BP.
I think the EPA has been struggling to respond to this crisis, said Aaron Viles with the Gulf Restoration Network. Everything is really a giant scientific experiment and we are terribly concerned that in the long run the impacts are going to be significant and we don't really know what we're doing to the ecosystem.
But the EPA argues that it deserves credit for getting an alarming use of dispersants under control. The directive states that BP should reduce the use of dispersants by 75 percent compared to the maximum daily amount used.
And that's the trap. The highest number of dispersant used occurred on May 23, when 70,000 gallons were injected into the Gulf of Mexico. Officials of the EPA say they feared that that number would have become the norm and so, they say, the directive was issued.
This escalation quickly reversed, ensuring BP only uses the smallest amount of dispersant needed, EPA spokesman Adora Andy said.
But even according to EPA standards, BP continues to routinely exceed the daily threshold. EPA and Coast Guard say they're trying to keep dispersing use at about 18,000 barrels a day.
But according to CNN's analysis, BP has exceeded that amount 50 percent of the time since the May 26 directive was issued. To do this, BP must apply to the United States Coast Guard for permission.
Coast Guard officials say that the use of dispersants is evaluated on a daily basis and that it is using the safest and most effective methods available to protect the marine environment.
The EPA-Coast Guard directive has been successful in ensuring that BP uses the lowest volume of dispersant required, the U.S. Coast Guard Lieutenant. Erik Halvorson, spokesperson for the Unified Area Command.
EPA continues to test the chemical dispersant Corexit 9500, which has been used by BP since the beginning of the oil disaster. So far, more than 1.6 million gallons of the chemical have been injected into the Gulf of Mexico.
But the struggle for the daily use of dispersants has attracted the attention of representative Ed Markey, D-Massachusetts, one of the strongest critics of BP's response to the cleanup of the oil spill.
I think it is obvious that we can never again allow a repetition of what is happening right now, where the scientific experiment is being carried out without having any idea what the impact on marine life will be in the long term, said Markey.

"There are seven days of the week, or 24-hour single-name periods designed to provide programming context and make time easier to measure. Each of these days is identifiable by specific plans, moods and tones.
Monday is seen by many as the ""worst"" day of the week, as it marks the return to work after the weekend, when most full-time employees receive two days off. Most students attend school in the morning and return home in the afternoon (usually from eight o'clock to three o'clock or seven o'clock to two o'clock), and most workers go to work in the morning and return home at night (usually from nine to five or eight to four).
Tuesday is the second day of the week, and it is in many ways similar to Monday. There are not many changes, in terms of schedule, between Tuesday and Monday; most people go to school or work and return home to watch TV, play video games, make plans with friends, spend time with family, read or participate in a similar leisure-related activity.
Wednesday is the third day of the week, and serves as the ""half"" of the workweek; some individuals refer to Wednesday as ""hump day"", as once their workday is complete, employees will have spent the workweek ""hump"", and will be in recession, as only two days at work will remain in the week.
Thursday is the fourth day of the week, and is viewed favorably by many, as it is quite close to the end of the workweek.
Friday is the fifth day of the week, and marks the end of the work week and the school week for the vast majority of employees and students. By Friday afternoon/afternoon, most students/workers cannot wait to leave and go home, as they will not have to return to school/work until Monday.
Saturday is perhaps the most respected day of the week. Because Sunday follows (and presumably there is no work or school to attend, for most people), everyone is free to stay out (or awake) until late at night, having fun with plans or other leisure-related activities. To be sure, Saturday is generally considered a day to participate in hobbies that otherwise could not be enjoyed during the regular week.
Sunday is the last day of the week, and is used by most as a day off. On Sundays fewer night plans are made, compared to Saturdays, as most people have to wake up for work or school on Monday morning.

"Unusually for someone who likes to chat, Kenton Cool can barely talk. Exercising at high altitude has left his voice a grunt of throat. He is now in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, after flying from Everest base camp that morning. Cool is reflecting on a surprising sequence of climbs completed over the previous weekend. Early on Saturday morning, he reached the summit of Nuptse, the first and lowest of the three main peaks in the Everest “horse house” surrounding the glacial valley called west of Cwm.
That same day, he climbed to the summit of Everest himself, reaching the top in complete darkness early on Sunday. He and his fellow climber continued to the Lhotse summit, the third of this spectacular three-step challenge, on Monday morning.
“It was an opportunity taken away,” he says. “For the first time since the late 1990s, there were fixed ropes in the three mountains. That doesn't take away the physical achievement of what I did. I've put the bar on a certain level. But whoever comes next will move the bar further and make it without ropes or bottled oxygen.”
Sixty years after Everest's first ascension, much of the coverage goes back to Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay and their age of innocence from the modern era of commercialism and environmental degradation. I've asked Cool to look forward and imagine what higher climbers they might be doing in 60 years.
“I hate to think,” he says, but he mentions the Swiss climber, Ueli Steck, who fled the mountain in April after what Cool calls “an altercation” with a crowd of sherpas at Camp 2. Steck, he says, planned to climb the western crest of Everest, made for the first time in 1963, descend to South Col and then immediately climb to Lhotse by a new route, all without fixed strings. “Ueli had been training like a machine,” says Cool. “It’s a climber in a class of its own. He is technically brilliant, but he had also taken his physical condition to an astronomical level. It would have been amazing to see what I could have done.”
Another issue is what tourism will look like. One clue is the impressive helicopter rescue by Simone Moro, Steck's climbing companion, whose intemperate language provoked confrontation at Camp 2. Moro flew to Everest on Tuesday to command a high-powered helicopter to rescue an injured climber at an altitude of 7,800 metres.
It was the highest rescue ever made in Everest and highlights the exponential increase in helicopter flights in recent years. By 2073, the mountain infrastructure could include a helipad at the South Col, bringing tourists breathing bottled oxygen. Meanwhile, they are transforming the potential to rescue the climbers and the many more numerous walkers heading to base camp.
According to Alton Byers, a mountain geographer and environmentalist, it is not yet known whether the Everest region can continue to face a booming tourism sector. The combination of climate change and tourism, he says, is creating new tensions in the Sherpa homeland. The withdrawal, and in some cases the disappearance, of glaciers in the Everest region is already having a major impact. “ Everywhere you go, people are talking about how there is less water. There is less water for agriculture and less water for all the new lodges being built.”
In the Sherpa city of Namche Bazaar, he says, a new five-mile pipeline is being put in place to bring water to serve the growing tourist demand for showers and toilets. The local current has been contaminated with human waste and does not provide enough water for a place that, in high season, is bursting into seams. “Every town is digging a hole just beyond homes in search of garbage. Khumbu has the highest landfills in the world,” he says. Human waste in base camp is now well managed and removed in plastic barrels. But, according to Byers, these barrels are emptied into a huge well a few hours into the valley that could leak into the watercourses of the region.
“These problems can be solved, but we have to take ourselves seriously,” he says. “A climber can spend $85,000 on climbing Everest. And that's fine. But at some point we're going to have to address these other priorities. For half a million dollars a year, you could solve most of them.”
Climate change is another issue. Byers works with local conservation committees to identify and plan the impacts of climate change, most of the time finding new sources of water or introducing rainwater harvesting. The rapid accumulation of glacial lakes that threaten to explode and flood the Sherpa homeland is a constant threat. “There will come a time when people will have to get out of their way.”
Changes in weather patterns are also having an impact on tourism. The increase in cloud coverage in periods of normally clear weather is closing the airport of Lukla, the gateway to the Everest region, more often. A new road for 4x4s to Lukla is being built to ensure the flow of tourists and their money, but Byers is concerned that the rapid expansion of the road network in Nepal is being done at low cost, with disastrous consequences in terms of soil erosion and landslides.
“Everest is the icon everyone knows,” he says. “It is the canary of the coal mine that everyone understands. It is the perfect laboratory to find out how to address some of these problems, such as the impacts of climate change and tourism.”

"From bright trees in the dark to underground bicycle sheds and solar-powered containers, we look at some of the most left-wing solutions to help make our cities more habitable.
Life in the city has many advantages, but a sustainable lifestyle is increasingly not among them. Pollution, traffic and the loss of green spaces are just some of the daily tests that the city's inhabitants have to face.
Step forward, the inventors. We consider ten of the craziest solutions to make our cities more habitable.
1 Emerging parks
Today's cities sometimes seem to be built more for cars than for people. The pop-up park is a simple idea. Take an empty parking lot, a pocket full of change and a pot plant or two, and make your own private park. The PARK(ing) project began as an artistic experiment in San Francisco and has since spread around the world. Temporary urban farms and ecological demonstrations are just some of the ideas that have emerged from the movement, which celebrates a day of action every September.
2 Underground storage
Not all urban inhabitants are hooked to the car. The bikes are increasingly in vogue. The question is: where to keep it safe? Giken, an engineering company based in Tokyo, has devised a concept for a solution: an “underground anti-seismic and eco-friendly bicycle park”. Just seven metres wide, the cylindrical storage facility is buried deep enough in the ground to house 204 bicycles. Owners can recover their bike by pressing a button, with the automated system that returns it on the ground in about 13 seconds.
3 Bright Trees in the Dark
When most people think of trees that shine in the dark, usually come to mind Christmas trinkets and fallen pine needles. No Daan Roosegaarde. The Dutch designer-artist has devised a “bioluminescent” plant. Experimental technology impels DNA from luminescent marine bacteria with a plant's chloroplast genome to create a jellyfish-like glow. Trials are being conducted to create an industrial-scale version of biomimetics-inspired technology that Roosegaarde hopes will one day replace conventional street lighting.
4 Harvest of Footsteps
Every day, hundreds of travelers and buyers in West Ham's East London neighborhood cross the elevated pedestrian walkway near the subway station. Few are likely to notice spring under their feet. Less still connect that five-millimeter flexion on the rubber surface to the power of the top lanterns. The paved pavement is covered with smart tiles that capture the kinetic energy of pedestrian steps and turn it into electricity. Pavegen, the British firm behind innovation, has installed a similar system at London's Heathrow Airport, among other international locations.
5 Supertrees
It had to happen over time: trees made by man. In Singapore’s Gardens by the Bay there is a small sketch of them. Up to 50 meters high, these steel ""supertrees"" not only have flowers and ferns that grow them, but their metal awnings act to absorb and disperse the heat as well. They are also equipped to harvest rainwater, as well as to provide air ventilation for two “climate controlled biomes” (large conservatories, in other words) below. Eleven of the 18 trees also feature solar panels along their ‘branches’.
6 water production billboard
We live in a world of consumption. And, so that we don't forget, advertisers wallpaper our cities and roads with billboard banks. Researchers from the University of Engineering and Technology of Lima have presented a poster with a difference. Using a system of capacitors and filters, it traps the humidity of the air and extracts the water vapor to produce about 96 liters of drinking water per day. The public can help itself free of charge.
7 Neo-walled wall gardens
The gardens ceased to be just the reserve of people's front lawns a long time ago. For a while, the rooftop gardens were all rage. Now, it's all about walls. Taking advantage of the advances of hydroponics (plants of cultivation without soil), the facades of a growing number of libraries and offices, shops and hotels are bursting in bloom. One of the companies that is at the forefront of the “living wall” boom is the UK-based company Biotecture. The company’s “vertical gardens” can be seen to grace the Taj Hotel in central London and the exit wall of Edgware Road Metro Station, among other places. Apart from aesthetics, green walls are credited with reducing air pollution and improving air quality.
8 Building powered by algae
To demonstrate the dynamism of the concept of “living wall”, look no further than the Hamburg International Construction Exhibition. Instead of sweet-smelling flowers, the south facing facades of the zero-carbon apartment complex are tied with green algae. The outer fabric of the walls includes a “bio-skin” of hollow grass panels in which the photosynthetic algae and grows. Periodically, algae are harvested from walls and fermented in a biogas plant to produce electricity.
9 Smart Wastebaskets
Forget about the gas dump trucks and stinky jumps. City authorities around the world are now turning to solar-powered “shock compactors” to keep garbage off the streets. The 150 gallon capacity garbage cans are equipped with an engine that pushes down the trash as it approaches the top. The engine is powered by solar panels embedded in the lid. BigBelly's newest bins include a wireless monitoring system that notifies garbage collectors when the bins are full.
10 Spray paint
Finally, desperate times sometimes require desperate measures. That is clearly what was going through the minds of the authorities in Chengdu, one of the fastest growing cities in China. To cheer the place up, the municipal landscaping department has led to spraying the green of the yellow grass. The use of non-toxic green spray has now spread to Tianjin and many other cities in northwestern China.

"I don't think the euro should exist, said Saxo Bank Lars Seer Christensen's co-CEO to CNN's Richard Quest, in terms that could hardly be less fractional for supporters of the single-currency bloc of 17 nations.
It is quite clear that what is missing here is fiscal union, but it is also very clear that the people of Europe do not support that objective.
The eurozone will also split as competitiveness continues to develop in different directions, said the head of the Danish online investment bank. He added that the eurozone population, in particular Germany, as the main pillar of the monetary area, will not sacrifice for the weakest part of the eurozone: Greece and other countries in southern Europe.
Christensen's controversial comments contrast strongly with what eurozone supporters have said, advocating austerity to keep the union together.
Germany, Europe's largest economy, fears that a Greek exit from the eurozone may lead to a domino effect in which other massively indebted countries -- Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy -- can withdraw from the common currency, leading to the disintegration of the eurozone.
In December 2012, German Chancellor Angela Merkel won more support for bailout funds for Greece. In July, Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, promised to do everything necessary to preserve the euro that triggered demonstrations for Greek, Spanish and Italian bonds.
However, Christensen of the Saxo Bank believes that the euro will disappear at some point in the future, and despite reaching the maximum of 13 months, because he believes that general support does not exist.
I am not saying that it is bad that support is not there, Christensen said, because the ability to adjust its currency is an important balance between different economies and different developments. When that's over, you'll have a whole different set of problems.
The bank's executive director refused to give a timeline, but said it depends on how long the Germans resist... how long the German population is willing to buy to support the tax union.
I can tell you that the problem is going to be bigger instead of smaller... I'm afraid the markets will end up dismantling the thing.

"David Cameron has declared a “clear result” in the Scottish independence referendum after Scotland voted for a margin of 10.6 points against ending the 307-year-old union with England and Wales. The Prime Minister promised a decentralization revolution throughout Britain, including votes on English issues by English parliamentarians in Westminster, as he celebrated Scotland's decision to stay within the UK. “There can be no disputes, no repetitions – we have heard the determined will of the Scottish people,” Cameron said in a statement
Previously, Scottish Prime Minister Alex Salmond remained defiant at a Scottish National Party rally in Edinburgh, saying he accepted that Scotland had not, “at this stage,” decided to vote for independence. He paid tribute to what he called a “triumph for democratic politics” and said he would work with Westminster in the best interest of Scotland and the rest of the UK – warning the leaders of the three main parties to keep their promises of further return to Scotland. “We have touched sectors of the community that have never been touched by politics before,” he said.
The campaign did achieve four major successes, winning 53% of the vote in Scotland's largest city, Glasgow, 57% in Dundee and 51% in North Lanarkshire. However, the camp was not victorious in 28 authorities. He won overwhelmingly in areas where he was expected to do well, including Edinburgh, Aberdeenshire and Borders, but also in areas that might have gone to the yes campaign, including the western islands. In the final count, the camp did not win 2,001,926 votes (55.3%) to 1,617,989 by itself (44.7%).
In his speech, Cameron made it clear that constitutional reforms, even in Scotland, would not be delivered until after the general elections, and that Scottish measures would be carried out along with changes in England. “We have heard Scotland’s voice and now we have to listen to the millions of voices in England,” he said.
Cameron added: “The people of Scotland have spoken and it is a clear result. They have kept our country from four nations together and, like millions of people, I am delighted. As I said during the campaign, I would have broken my heart to see our UK come to an end. And I know that that feeling was shared by people not only throughout our country but all over the world because of what we have accomplished together in the past and what we can do together in the future. Therefore, it is now time for our United Kingdom to meet and move forward. A vital part of this will be a balanced deal, just for the people in Scotland and, more importantly, for everyone in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, too.”
Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, said the referendum was a vote by the Scottish people for change. “We know that our country needs to change in the way it is governed and we know that our country needs to change in who is governed. We will gain stronger powers for a stronger Scottish parliament, a strong Scotland.” But he said that would go beyond Scotland. “We will also satisfy the desire for change throughout England, throughout Wales, throughout the UK.”
Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, said the referendum “marks not only a new chapter for Scotland within the UK, but also a broader constitutional reform across the union.” Echoing the SNP’s argument, he said a vote against independence was “clearly not a vote against change.” “We must now deliver the radical package of powers just transferred to Scotland on time and in full,” he added.
However, that result increases the risk of further agitation, with Cameron Conservative Party MPs threatening to rebel against the Prime Minister's late and potentially vital promise to quickly increase the powers of the Scottish parliament while protecting its spending.
UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage said Cameron's offer of more decentralization to England was not far enough. “The English are 86% of the population of this union. They have been excluded from all this for the past 18 years. We still have a situation in which Scottish Members can vote in the House of Commons on matters that concern only the English. I think what most English people want is a fair settlement,” he said.
Cameron and the Queen will move to calm tensions when they make statements about the outcome. The Prime Minister will try, in the words of a cabinet minister, to “cement” the negative vote by outlining how he will carry out the deepening of Scotland’s return agreement, including the handing over of greater powers over taxes and welfare to the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh.
The Queen, who has monitored the referendum with interest, will make a written statement. It is understood that his remarks will focus on reconciliation. The Prime Minister wants to act quickly to show that the three leading leaders of the UK party will live up to the commitments made during the referendum campaign to fulfill what former Prime Minister Gordon Brown called “domestic governance” within the UK.
Ministers believe that it is important to act quickly to avoid a repetition of the 1980 referendum in Québec. Ontario's triumphant behavior fueled the separatist cause that almost succeeded in a second referendum in 1995.
For the campaign no, there was relief: a lot of authorized polls in the last days of the campaign had said that the vote was on a knife edge, taking Yes Scotland a moving distance from victory after a dramatic increase in support.

"A man who is believed to have been exposed to the deadly ricin poison in a hotel room in Las Vegas, Nevada, is out of his coma and is being questioned by the authorities, said FBI Special Agent David Staretz on Friday.
Ricin, weapons and an anarchist-type textbook were found in a room at this Las Vegas hotel, according to the police.
Staretz no longer commented on Roger Bergendorff, 57, to whom authorities said he was taken to a hospital on 14 February after complaining about respiratory difficulties.
He is in critical condition, said Naomi Jones, spokesman for the Spring Valley Hospital Medical Center in Las Vegas.
Bergendorff, an artist who neighbors said had lived in his cousin's basement before moving to Las Vegas, was exposed to poison at a long-stay hotel in Las Vegas, a law enforcement officer said.
The Riverton, Utah, home where Bergendorff previously lived belongs to Thomas Tholen, who along with his wife and daughter tested negative for the ricin, according to authorities. That house and three storage areas in nearby West Jordan, Utah, were searched for ricin earlier this month and declared safe by the authorities.
A relative who went to the hotel room in Bergendorff after being sent to the hospital found the substance and alerted the police on 27 February.
Ricin is a poison that can be produced from waste left over after processing castor beans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It can come in the form of haze or pellet and can dissolve in water or weak acid, the agency said. E-mail to a friend

"There's nothing terribly surprising about Apple's renewed tablet line, but that's fine.
We spent some time testing and playing the new iPad Mini and iPad Air after Tuesday's press conference. As promised by Apple executives, the new devices were lighter, thinner and seemingly faster, as were many incremental product updates from the past.
iPad Air
There were no important new features, such as the fingerprint scanner or the update of the camera that came with the iPhone 5S.
The most unexpected news of the day was a new name for the $599 iPad, which is now the iPad Air. The iPad line has been a little washy with the names.
He started by counting each version, but then dropped the number and asked only to be known as iPad, like Cher. The iPad 2 kept its number and a place in stores, where its slightly lower price - LRB- now $399 -RRB- could appeal to someone considering a cheaper Android or Windows tablet.
Physically, the iPad Air is actually lighter and thinner than its predecessor. It is 20% thinner than the third generation iPad, measuring at a slight 29 cm. An ad shown at the press conference showed an iPad Air lying on a tablet, quietly hidden behind a No. Two pencils. It has also lowered a little weight and the Wi-Fi version is now exactly 1 pound -LRB- the cellular version is 1.05 pounds -RRB-.
Unfortunately, I didn't have an older iPad on hand to make a weight comparison, and I had taken an iPad Mini first. Nothing makes a normal iPad feel heavy like holding an iPad Mini. You can't feel a Mini; it's so deliciously small.
The iPad Air has a 64-bit A7 processor, the same chip recently introduced on the iPhone 5S. The A7 should benefit heavy graphics programs like iMovie and iPhoto, and Phil Schiller said it would double the performance of the previous chip.
It is difficult to judge speed increases for a few minutes in a crowded room without proper testing and an equally empty previous generation device to use for comparison.
Apple's fresh produce always feels more zippier than previous generations. Part of that is the constant improvement of processors inside, but it is also the benefit of working on a new device that has not been slowed down gradually by application pages, hundreds of cat videos and the latest OS update.
Mini iPad with Retina display
The iPad Mini got its first update since it was first released a year ago.
Physically, the device is a dead bell for the original. Turn it on, and you'll see that it addresses one of the biggest complaints about the first version updating the screen to a 2048 by 1536 screen containing 326 pixels per inch, a big jump of the 163 pixels above per inch. Several Apple products already have the Retina display: the iPhone 4S and higher, the fourth generation iPod Touch, the 10-inch iPad and some MacBook Pros. -LRB- Apple says Retina Display is so good that the human eye cannot detect individual pixels on the device -RRB-.
Like the iPad Air, the iPad Mini with Retina has the A7 chip inside. Previously the Mini was a generation behind its biggest iPad brother in processor speed. But this update and the new screen put the devices on the same level, so choosing a smaller screen no longer means opting for the lower product.
The smaller size of the tablet is a competitive market, and the iPad Mini with Retina Display is finally Apple's premium offer for the size of 7.9 inches. The $399 tablet is now in a better position to take on products like Google 7 Nexus, Samsung Galaxy Tablets and Amazon Kindle HDX. Although other products can usually be kept for much less, any practical time with Apple products reminds you that one of their largest points of sale is solid, high-quality construction.
The missing update
Shave excess volume and change faster processors is of rigueur for any product update these days. Other companies could launch in price drops, but Apple is comfortable in place in the high end of the consumer market. You cannot start cutting devices for your flagship devices. Instead, the company keeps older models available, although even those have a somewhat high price.
Unfortunately, there is a key feature where all tablet manufacturers seem to have stalled: battery life.
Faster processors absorb more battery power, so keeping 10 hours of battery life from an old tablet to a new tablet probably requires battery upgrades. Both new iPads have the same M7 motion coprocessor that handles sensors, such as accelerometer and gyroscope, saving battery power by not using the main processor.
Apart from an hour here or there, mobile device manufacturers seem stuck in the mid-day mark, a frustrating limitation for people who have adapted when loading chargers and returning when they see an empty exit in a cafe, airport or friends' house.
For now, Apple is comfortable enough with the competition to simply iterate on its popular and well-designed products, making the usual round of upgrades and launching on the occasional eye-catching feature to catch attention, such as fingerprints on the iPhone 5S.
It may not be so much fun for technology fans that they were used to new spattered products and well-kept secrets, but it's probably a solid business decision.
According to Forrester analyst Sarah Rotman Epps, replacement tablet sales are growing faster than new tablet sales around the world. Manufacturers need to compete to keep customers who already have to consider upgrading an old model.
All tablet manufacturers are competing with what are essentially the same minor settings.
The competition will stay close until the first company leaves the usual upgrade cycle faster, thinner and faster and solves the battery problem.

"A thick bark of bird droppings accumulates in the golden balustrade of one of Britain's most expensive properties. The skeletons of pigeons are found between broken mirrors and streams of water through broken carnage. This is The Towers, a 30 million-pound palace in “Billonaires’ Row” in northern London, whose spectacular ruin has been kept secret so far.
It is one of the ten mansions in the center of Bishops Avenue, the heart of London's spiral real estate market, which have remained almost totally vacant since they were purchased a quarter century ago, is believed on behalf of members of the royal family of Saudi Arabia. Their Greek columns are cracking into pieces and the mosaic pools are full of rubble. Nature has taken control to the extent that owls have moved.
It is a desolate scene repeated up and down the supposedly prestigious avenue that Lloyds Bank has calculated is the second most expensive street in Britain. While more and more people are struggling to climb the London real estate ladder as housing prices rise by 11.2% a year, 16 mansions on the most expensive stretch of Bishops Avenue are empty, many behind padlocked doors, with their windows closed with steel grills and covered grounds patrolled by guard dogs.
On the other side of the street is another abandoned mansion, worth 18 million pounds, with windows and broken walls covered with anti-climb paint. The metal grids block the windows of another, which has been sold for 20 million pounds.
But that doesn't stop prices from going up. Dryades, a mansion until recently owned by a Pakistani politician, was sold for £12 million in 2007 and is believed to be worth about £30 million today. Heath Lodge, the scene of the 1984 murder, by silver bullet, of fashion tycoon Aristos Constantinou, is worth £13 million today, after being sold in the late 1970s for £400,000.
Neglect can be agonizing for people struggling to keep a roof over their heads in one of the most expensive cities in the world. A security guard working on the avenue said it was exasperating to see so many tens of thousands of square feet of property – enough to house dozens of people – fall apart.
Royal oil-rich Nigeria and Saudi Arabia were the first to reach this curved road near Hampstead Heath. The Iranians fled here after the fall of the Shah. Now, Chinese house hunters are following Russians and Kazakhs who have spent millions securing an address from real estate agents tell them he is as famous in the world as the Champs-Elysées and Rodeo Drive. Recently, two mansions have been for sale for £65m and £38m, promising endless Italian marble, leather padded elevators and luxurious panic rooms.
However, on the grounds of empty mansions, the stone fountains crumble and the lawns have become swamps. Inside one, the water drips through a huge glass candlestick over a thick carpet that rots under sections of the collapsed ceiling. The moss grows through broken bricks and mirrored tiles scattered through a bathroom. The pool is filled with a salty water foot and has flowers that grow through its tiles. The wooden slats move away from the sauna.
But it is the shipwreck of Las Torres, a large mansion located between acres of hornbeams, oaks and lime trees, which is more dramatic, with its huge high ceiling rooms occupied by pigeons and its walls turned bright green by algae while the water pours through three floors and plinks into a vast, empty pool, basement. Unopened wooden boxes marked as “bullet-proof glass” reveal the security fears of previous owners.
Today, very few people live on the Avenue of Bishops full time. A security guard patrolling the pavement outside a mansion said the owners weren't there. Another, outside Royal Mansion, refused to say if anyone was at home, while a staff member from another mansion simply warned the Guardian about the guard dogs. Magdy Adib Ishak-Hannah, a private health tycoon born in Egypt, whose personal wealth is 45 million pounds, said he was in the minority of permanent residents.
“It’s not a neighboring place, where you can chat about the fence,” he said. “To be honest, I’ve never seen what my neighbors look like. Next door, a Saudi princess spent 35 million pounds on a new house and I've never seen it. There are about three houses that live in 24/7 and half of the properties are occupied from three to six months a year. The other half, who knows if they're coming or not?
The shipwrecks of several million pounds are evidence of a property culture in which the richest people in the world view British property as investments. A Hyde Park, a block of apartments in Knightsbridge, is another example in which more than half of the flats are registered on the council as empty or second homes.
However, the talk on the avenue is about the construction of £5m apartments, instead of £50m mansions, in an effort to draw people back.
Anil Varma, a local real estate developer, has decided to rebuild one of the most valuable sites on the avenue as a collection of 20 apartments with concierge, cleaning service, 25 meter swimming pool, spa and cinema.
“If you build a big house and try to sell for £30m to £40m, it won’t sell,” he said. “The locals will not buy and therefore you have to bring foreign buyers.”
But the prospect of empty ownership of the avenue being used to help resolve the housing crisis remains distant. Andrew Harper, a local conservative councillor, laughed when asked if some of the abandoned houses could be converted into affordable homes. He said the price of the land would be prohibitive.
“Very rich people own properties there,” he said. “Sometimes they live in them and sometimes they don’t.”

"Again, there are rumors that the third - and fourth largest wireless aircraft carriers in the U.S. can merge to form a No. 3. But would this be enough to keep the U.S. market wireless? competitive for consumers?
Last week Bloomberg reported that Deutsche Telekom AG, T-Mobile's parent company, is negotiating a possible sale of T-Mobile to Sprint Nextel Corp..
According to The Hill and The Washington Post, some industry analysts believe that the US government would approve this merger. Rumors of this merger have existed since 2009, when DT was looking at a purchase of Sprint.
And last weekend, TMOnews reported on an ambiguous non-confirmation/non-denial memorandum sent to T-Mobile employees by CEO Philip Humm.
Given the nature of wireless networks and the current business landscape, T-Mobile probably needs to make some kind of important move if he hopes to survive somehow.
In the overall picture, a lot of capital is needed to build high-speed wireless broadband networks that can support an increasing number of data-hungry devices, such as smartphones and tablets, especially if streaming mobile video becomes popular, and if the Obama administration takes its national wireless initiative seriously to make wireless broadband available to 98% of the American population.
Carriers with the largest customer base, especially those with the most customers secured expensive two-year contracts, are in the best financial position to build their 4G networks.
Having those networks, in turn, makes larger companies even more likely to attract even more customers. And this is the economic dynamic that could turn the wireless market in the U.S. in a Verizon/AT & T duopoly, with only a few discount carriers surviving on the margins.
For US mobile users, further consolidation of the wireless market is good news/bad situation. It offers the promise of omnipresent high-speed wireless broadband networks available in markets outside major metropolitan areas, thus reducing the geographical aspect of the mobile digital divide.
But just because wireless broadband is available in a region doesn't mean that everyone there can afford to use it. A less competitive wireless market could mean that wireless broadband is not much cheaper. It could even be more costly, especially if staggered data plans became the norm, which would make more sense for carriers in a less competitive environment.
That would be bad news on the revenue/class front of the mobile digital divide.
Lately, T-Mobile has been getting a little bit of a beating on the U.S. market. Bloomberg noted: T-Mobile... has lost customers at an accelerated pace, as it outpaced its rivals in building a third-generation mobile network and missed the possibility of selling Apple's iPhone. About 56,000 customers left T-Mobile USA last year, while Sprint, AT&T and Verizon Wireless increased their accounts.
Consequently, DT may not be satisfied with what Sprint may be willing to offer for T-Mobile -- so who knows if this merger is going to happen.
In addition, a T-Mobile/Sprint merger could be difficult for technical reasons.
Wireless Week noted: T-Mobile currently markets its HSPA+ network as 4G, but lacks the bandwidth to implement LTE or WiMAX. Sprint and T-Mobile use different network technologies and operate in different spectrum bands, which would complicate a possible merger of companies' wireless services.
If T-Mobile hopes to survive intact, it will need access to much more bandwidth in more U.S. locations. So if the Sprint merge doesn't happen, T-Mobile has options -- mainly rent extra spectrum or access to other provider networks, such as LightSquared, a wireless wholesale LTE network.

"It is not only the largest hamburger chain in the world; it is also a global emblem of U.S. consumer capitalism. But these days, McDonald’s golden arches are a little tarnished. After a decade of expansion, customers around the world no longer seem to love them. McDonald’s has revealed that world sales dropped 3.3% in 2013 in a set of results that were described as atrocious.
The problems are accumulating almost everywhere. In China, sales sank 23% after a food scare when local media showed workers apparently captured in the chamber of a local supplier claiming to use beef and chicken in products destined for McDonald’s and KFC. In Europe, sales have fallen by 4%, mainly due to riots in Ukraine and the bitter anti-Western mood in Russia. About 200 of McDonald’s 450 restaurants in Russia are being investigated by health inspectors in seemingly politically motivated food safety controls. Ten have been closed.
But it is in the United States, where McDonald’s has about 40% of its restaurants, where the crisis is deepest. Almost 60 years after Ray Kroc opened his first restaurant in Des Plaines, Illinois, consumers are losing their appetite for a Big Mac and chips.
McDonald’s has seen 12 consecutive months of declining sales in its massive real estate market, with sales of 4.1% in the last quarter. Younger diners are deserting from the restaurant in herds to eat in rivals like Chipotle Mexican Grill. The number of young people aged 19 to 21 visiting McDonald’s once a month has decreased by 13% since 2011, according to Technomic food analysts, while the number of young people aged 22 to 37 visiting McDonald’s has not increased.
To add to the company’s problems, McDonald’s burgers were recently named America’s worst in a poll of over 32,000 American diners, who said they would prefer to eat a burger at Five Guys, Smashburger or Fuddruckers. The fast-growing Chick-fil-A chain in the United States was considered the best for chicken. McDonald’s is also widely perceived as less healthy than most of its rivals, especially Chipotle, who trumpet their antibiotic-free meat and ""seasonal local products,"" although ""local"" for Chipotle can mean 350 miles away.
Consumers’ deep distrust of McDonald’s was exposed by a consumer outreach exercise that the company launched in the United States in October. “Have you ever used pink drool on your burgers?” was a question on the Our Food Your Questions website – referring to the controversial filler of beef (grastle and fat) used for dog foods sprayed with ammonia to make it “fit” for human consumption. The meat product, banned in Europe since the BSE crisis, was abandoned by McDonald’s in 2012.
But the pink drool has left doubts in the minds of American consumers. “Donald’s meat contains worms?” another person asked (“No. Gross. End of story,” the company replied. Others wanted to know if he used real eggs or whether the McRib was made with the same plastic contained in yoga mats. Don Thompson, Managing Director of McDonald’s, acknowledged that the company had a job to do to address the misconceptions about the freshness, quality and integrity of its ingredients.
However, just like McDonald’s has been losing customers who will pay a little more for fresher and healthier foods, it has also lost its advantage in essential fast food products: fast service at low prices. Since he introduced $2 items into his dollar menu, he has earned a reputation for being more expensive than his rivals, while many consumers complain that the service is slower.
The label “caro” was unjustified, said Mary Chapman at Technomic. “Prices have gone up, but they haven’t gone up as fast as the rest of the fast service chains in the US.” Prices at McDonald’s have increased by 4.8 per cent since 2009, well below the average for the “fast service” sector (19.4 per cent), while the cost of fast casual food, a category that includes Chipotle, is rising by 16.9 per cent, according to the Technomic menu monitor. United States consumer prices increased by 11 per cent during the same period.
But critics have a point when it comes to longer queues. McDonald’s has a bigger menu than some, with more complicated elements – its McWrap chicken takes 60 seconds to make. “I think it’s worth waiting, but the guy behind me who wants his double cheeseburger for a dollar may not,” Chapman said.
In the UK, McDonald’s has turned its business around, making Britain an exceptional place for the company. A competitive breakfast menu, improved coffee and free Wi-Fi had given McDonald’s a wide appeal in the UK, said Peter Martin of the CGA Peach consultant whose figures show that 56% of British adults have visited a McDonald’s restaurant at least once in the past six months.
Executives promise to address misconceptions about their food in their domestic market. Thompson has promised more organic food and custom-made burgers, but, to reduce queues, he also wants to introduce simpler menus. Analysts are scratching their heads on how the company can square the circle of simpler menus and a greater choice over fillers.
“They want to simplify the menu but improve their ability to customize and that sounds complicated,” Mark Kalinowski said at Janney Capital Markets. Only four of McDonald’s’s 14,000 American restaurants had so far tried “building their own burger,” he said, asking questions about how it could be expanded. “Right now, we are skeptical; we would like to see more details.”
Meanwhile, despite declining sales, the chain continues to expand globally: by the end of 2014, it hopes to have opened 1,400 new restaurants. Kalinowski expects McDonald's market share to continue to decline, but he, too, warned against the company's cancellation. “You can never really count McDonald’s out. We believe it will be number one in terms of total sales for not only years but decades to come.”

"JMW Turner, one of the best painters in Britain, is going to be the face of the new £20 note, after a nationwide vote.
It will be the first time an artist has appeared on a British ticket, after the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, asked the public to nominate a deceased cultural figure who felt deserved the high honor.
Turner, famous for his spectacular marine landscapes, beat the competition of 590 painters, sculptors, fashion designers, photographers, filmmakers and actors proposed by 30,000 members of the public.
The list included Alfred Hitchcock, Alexander McQueen, Derek Jarman, Laura Ashley, William Morris and Vanessa Bell, which was then reduced by a panel of artists, critics and historians to a final choice of five.
The last five – Barbara Hepworth, Charlie Chaplin, Josiah Wedgwood, William Hogarth and Turner – were selected on the basis of their “unquestionable” contribution to both the visual arts and British society as a whole, as well as their lasting influence.
Properly, the announcement of the new ticket was made at the Turner Contemporary gallery in Margate, which is located on the former site of Mrs Booth's guest house, where Turner always stayed when he visited it. The announcement was made jointly by Carney and artist Tracey Emin, who grew up in the city.
Carney said it had been “so important to do this well and have a proper process involving the public,” adding that, far from being a purely practical necessity, “if done correctly, they can be a piece of art in everyone’s pocket.”
“Money is a memory for a country and its people,” said the Governor of the Bank of England. “The Bank of England notes are a celebration of the heritage of the United Kingdom, a greeting to its culture, a testament to its great achievements, including those of its most notable citizens. In short, money not only has economic value, it also has cultural value.
“Turner is undoubtedly the most influential British artist of all time. His work was transformative and endures today. And his work will now be presented in another 2 billion works of art – our new £20 notes.”
“The fact that we have Turner in the £20 note now shows that the British people are a nation of people who appreciate creativity and the arts,” Emin said.
The note will feature Turner's 1799 self-portrait, which currently hangs on Tate Britain, as well as one of his most recognizable works, The Fighting Temeraire, a tribute to the boat that played a distinguished role in Nelson's victory at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.
The note will also include a quote from the artist – “light is therefore color” – as well as his signature, taken from his will, in which he bequeathed many of his works to the nation.
The new £20 note, which replaces the one presented by social philosopher and economic theorist Adam Smith, will come into circulation by 2020. This is the first time that the public has been given an opinion on whose face appears on a British ticket.",C1
"Felipe Massa had emergency surgery for a fractured skull after an accident in the final classification for the Hungarian Grand Prix on Sunday.
Felipe Massa receives attention after his high-speed accident in the Hungarian Grand Prix classification.
The Brazilian moved away in the 200kph Turn Four in the Hungaroring after being hit on the hull by flying debris from the rear wing of the Brawn GP of compatriot Rubens Barrichello.
The 2008 runner-up was stunned and lost control as his Ferrari flew against a high-speed tyre wall.
He was taken by air from the circuit to the AEK hospital in Budapest and later underwent an emergency operation for damage to his skull.
The mass is in intensive care in a respirator and remains under observation in an induced coma.
The driver’s condition is serious, but stable, a hospital spokesman said.
After the terrifying incident, Fernando Alonso claimed a surprising pole position in a chaotic end of Saturday's proceedings.
Massa's accident occurred at the end of the second qualifying session and the action was suspended while officials were checking the debris.
When the third and final qualifying session was launched it was Renault Alonso time the fastest time of a minute 21.559 seconds.
Sebastian Vettel, second in the Jenson Button title race, will start alongside Alonso in the front row, with his team-mate Red Bull Mark Webber ranked third.
Button was only eighth fastest with his team-mate Brawn GP Barrichello 13th best, his worst qualifying performance of the season.
Button delayed his final qualifying career while his car was checked after the previous incident.
World champion Lewis Hamilton was fourth best for the McLaren team with Nico Rosberg in fifth place for Williams.
With the electronic time system lost in the pit lane and television coverage, former world champion Alonso did not know at first that he had taken his first pole of the season.
We have taken a good step forward and the car improved in the last two races. We're more competitive, but I don't think we're as fast as these two guys - LRB- referring to the Red Bull Vettel and Webber pilots -RRB-, he said.
We will try to win, but being honest and realistic, our goal is to get some good points, the Spanish added.

"Olympic skater Nancy Kerrigan Solomon cried Thursday for the indulgence of her brother, who was sentenced to prison for a lesser charge in his fatal altercation with his father.
A Middlesex County High Court judge sentenced Mark Kerrigan to 2.5 years after a jury convicted him on Wednesday for assault and assault.
A jury acquitted Kerrigan for manslaughter. The prosecution argued that old Kerrigan died of a heart attack caused during a physical struggle.
Solomon asked Judge Jane Haggerty not to spend time in prison for her brother, saying that the family had already suffered enough trauma and hardship.
“None of us has really had the opportunity to cry for our father,” he said in court.
Mark Kerrigan was arrested immediately, said Cara O'Brien, spokesman for the Middlesex County Attorney's Office.
The judge sentenced Mark Kerrigan to serve two years in prison, followed by two years of probation, during which he will have to meet several conditions, including mental health and alcohol abuse treatment, according to O'Brien.
If Kerrigan completes all conditions, the remaining six months of his prison sentence will be suspended, the judge ruled.
Mark Kerrigan showed little emotion when the verdict was read Wednesday in Woburn, Massachusetts.
“My family has never believed that my brother had anything to do with my father’s death,” Nancy Kerrigan said outside the courthouse. My father would never have wanted any of this.
Prosecutors say that Daniel Kerrigan, 70, died after having a physical argument and confrontation with his intoxicated son.
A medical examiner had found that the death of Daniel Kerrigan in 2010 came from the cardiac arrhythmia triggered by the fight, which resulted in a larynx injury. Cardiac arrhythmia is an abnormal electrical activity in the heart.
Kerrigan's family said Daniel Kerrigan had heart disease.

"1 racing engineer
A racing engineer maintains contacts between the driver and mechanics.
Typical salary: New graduates start at £25,000 to £30,000 and quickly progress to junior engineer positions, earning more than £40,000 with only a few years of experience. Senior racing engineers earn between £50,000 and 90,000 and promotions often lead to six-figure wages.
What the work involves: “A racing engineer acts as an interpreter between racing mechanics and the driver,” says racing engineer Jamie Muir. “The engineer takes feedback from the driver, analyzes the available data and makes decisions about the configuration necessary for maximum performance, then transmits this to the mechanics to instigate.”
Qualifications: A university degree, typically in automotive/mechanical engineering or motorsport technology. Practical experience is essential.
To succeed as a racing engineer, you need to be able to deal with the pressure.
The worst thing about work: long hours. “The race engineers work 24 hours a day,” says Chris Aylett, CEO of Motorsport Industry Association.
2 Ethical Hacker
Typical wage: £60,000 to £90,000 at team leader level, while a newly qualified hacker can expect a minimum wage from £35,000 to £50,000.
What the job involves: A company will pay an ethical hacker to hack into its computer system to see how well it could face a real attack.
Qualifications: You do not necessarily need a degree in computer science. The sector accepts people with a wide range of academic qualifications and competences.
To succeed as an ethical hacker, you need a passion for technology and detail. You should also have a very good analytical mind and enjoy solving difficult problems.
The worst of the job: When you are called to test a new client's network security just to find out that they have already been victims of a data breach.
3 Pump Removal Diver
Typical wage: In the private sector, you can earn up to £100,000 by working only two months out of every three.
What the work involves: Descending to the seabed and searching for unexploded ordnance (bombs, projectiles, grenades and landmines), then either recovering and collecting the weapons safely or discarding them safely.
Qualifications: To dive on the high seas, you must have diving inspection and medical-technical qualifications. In order to safely dispose of the bombs, you will also need an explosive ordnance disposal rating and years of experience.
To succeed as a bomb disposal diver, you need to... stay calm in stressful situations. You work on your own in depth, with little visibility and, if you don't like living in small spaces confined to many other people, forget it.
Worst of work: Expect to be away from home at least six months of the year.
4 Social engineer
Typical wage: Between £50,000 and £80,000, on average. Graduates start at £25,000, but wages increase rapidly with qualifications and experience.
Work: A social engineer is paid by a company to try to trick its employees into disclosing confidential information that allows them to access sensitive company data or the company's computer network.
Qualifications: Typically, social engineers have a degree in IT, although an understanding of psychology is useful, as is training in marketing, teaching and customer service.
To succeed as a social engineer, it takes... the confidence to lie convincingly and the ability to fit in almost anywhere without looking too out of place. It also needs a strong sense of personal ethics and an understanding of the law.
The Worst of Work: Other people can misunderstand your work: social engineers are not spies, but most people think they are.

Typical duties include managing other staff, serving at each meal, running errands, caring for guests, booking restaurants, home security, cleaning, cooking and anything else the home needs.
Qualifications: You do not need any specific qualification, but you can take a course at the British Academy of Butler or the British Institute of Butler.
To succeed as a butler, it takes... the mentality of someone who really thrives in caring for others.
The worst thing about work: Long hours and unpredictable working hours mean it's hard to have a family life. Butlers also suffer from isolation, cultural differences with their employer, and “having to work for people who are not always kind,” says Sara Vestin, director of the British Academy of Butler.

"Representative Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a key Congressional voice on national security, announced Friday that he will not run for re-election this year.
The Republican of Michigan made the announcement at the WJR radio station in Detroit, saying he will host a syndicated radio program that will talk about national security issues and other news of the day.
I had a career before politics and I always planned to have one later, Rogers said in a statement. The genius of our institutions is that they do not depend on the privileged individual temporary occupants to serve. That is why I have decided not to seek re-election for Congress in 2014.
Rogers, who has held a seat in Congress for more than a decade and is close to House President John Boehner, has been a strong supporter of the National Security Agency's surveillance programs, which were set on fire after Edward Snowden's leaks publicly revealed their nature.
This week, he and Representative Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland -- the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee -- developed a plan to end the NSA's extensive collection of massive telephone records.
Obama, Congress working on NSA changes
Rogers has said in the past that the phone and electronic surveillance programs were not abused and has shrillly criticized Snowden, a former NSA contractor.
It has also recognized public concerns about government storage of surveillance data.
That's really what we're trying to do here is to ease the concern that there could be abuse in the future of these programs, Rogers said recently.
Authorization for those programs expires on Friday, but President Barack Obama is expected to seek temporary renewal while Congress is working on reform legislation, a senior administration official said.
Rogers is also one of the favorites of Sunday public affairs programming in which he frequently criticizes Obama.
He joins a cadre of House members who are not seeking re-election in November, but his seat in Congressional District 8 is still considered relatively safe for Republicans.
But Rothenberg's Political Report and Cook's Political Report changed his analysis of the district from probably Republican to Republican inclined for the November elections after Rogersannouncement.
The Democrats sought to unite Rogers and Boehner.
The main chairmen of the Republican committees continue to flee John Boehner's broken Congress instead of defending their indefensible record of agreeing with special interests over middle-class families who have earned them a record low approval ratings, New York's Steve Israel representative chairing the Democratic Congress Campaign Committee.
Rogers became a key figure in the development of U.S. national security policy, informed by his experience as an Army officer and special agent of the FBI.
U.S., other powers drive Russia out of the G8
Mike has spent his whole life making sure that our country has been safe from both domestic and foreign threats, Congressional Republican National Committee Chairman Greg Walden said in a statement. He never let partisan politics stand in the way of doing what is right for our nation and its security. I can't think of anyone who enjoys more respect from both Republicans and Democrats.
Before Rogers became president, he published an Intelligence Committee report on Iran's nuclear ambitions, wrote a bill to protect against chemical and biological threats, and co-authored legislation that reauthorized the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, his biography of the Intelligence Committee said.
Mike Rogers is as solid as they come... one of those patriots willing to go to the wall to keep the American people safe, no matter the tension or sacrifice, Boehner said in a statement.
Jim Acosta, Tom Cohen, Lisa Desjardins and John Helton of CNN contributed to this report.

"There are eyes on you, behind the bright lights and the mirror panels. Pick up a boot and a camera will make sure it doesn't slide into your bag. Get into a department store and they'll keep an eye on you. But new technology is leading retailers to grow a different set of eyes – less focused on shoplifting and more interested in their age, sex, size, head, shoulders, knees and toes.
A few months ago, Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) produced a report stating that about 30% of retailers use facial recognition technology to track customers in the store. Facial recognition is a technology that can identify people by analyzing and comparing the facial characteristics of a database, using devices such as Intel RealSense cameras, which are able to analyze everything, from particular expressions to the clothing brands that someone wears.
Joe Jensen of Intel’s Retail Solutions Division says that the goal of bringing RealSense technology to stores is not to create databases of specific people’s lives, but rather to build generalized models of people’s lifestyles and buying habits. “It’s not so much that you need to meet a particular customer. It is necessary to know that this buyer has these characteristics and, in the past, that when those characteristics are present, this is what a person tends to do.”
If you combine recognition technology with databases of past customer patterns, you can start predicting a lot about what a person can or can't do in a store. If, let's say, there's a woman size 10 who wears a gold necklace walking fast into the sock aisle, you can use that data to predict what she wants, well, to buy socks. This could allow a retailer to automatically place targeted ads on screens specifically aimed at that person. If you look like the kind of person who wants to buy socks, they'll show you socks ads.
If it sounds familiar, it's because the online world has been using techniques like this for years.
If you look for something on Amazon, you will be chased by targeted banners for similar products elsewhere. Express a vague interest in canoeing and you will receive canoe ads wherever you go. However, bringing these systems into the physical world is not a simple case of copying and pasting. It turns out that people don't react to cameras the same way they do to browser cookies.
Hoxton Analytics, a London-based team of data scientists, has developed a technology that uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to categorize people according to the shoes they wear. By analyzing the style and size of people's shoes when passing the sensor, the system can identify the gender of a customer with between 75 and 80% accuracy.
Owen McCormack, CEO of Hoxton Analytics, says that the system's approach emerged in part as a reaction to facial recognition. “My idea was, why don’t we just consider the clothes someone is wearing to understand demography?” he said. “If I just showed you a picture of someone’s body, you could probably tell me what kind they are. However, it turns out that pointing a camera to someone's chest or hips feels as creepy as facial recognition. The idea was – what about people’s shoes?”
The word “crepey” appears a lot during discussions about follow-up in the store. For retailers and data scientists, the goal is to find a way to obtain information without becoming intrusive.
For Hoxton Analytics and retailers who use technology, the answer is to look down. This tactic of avoiding the face and staring at the shoes says a lot about how we, as physical beings, react to being observed. He suggests that there are limits that do not exist on the Internet. Look at our torsos and we feel invaded. But is it less invasive to make calculated judgments about a person based on his shoes?
For McCormack, the argument is based on the fact that identifiable personal information is not being collected. “At the moment, stores are doing a lot of incredibly invasive things, but we don’t know anything about it. The angle that Hoxton Analytics is taking is, well, if you know that someone is a man or a woman, then your advertising will be much more efficient. If you know that everyone in your store is a man right now, you will be advertising PlayStations not hair dryers.”
Keeping it hidden and invisible monitoring allows stores to optimize their output while keeping the customer unconscious. Put adaptive monitors and targeted advertising in the mix, however, and it becomes harder to hide the fact that a machine is watching you. The argument of retailers is that they do this to provide a personal shopping experience, but it is still a grey area. It still feels creepy.
From the point of view of retailers, it is understandable that physical stores want some of the online information points to collect. We let this happen online, so why not off-line? The thresholds of a shopping mall are different from those that exist between the websites and, when you can freely wander from one place to another without a pop-up asking you to accept cookies, the consent rules change.
On the other hand, for a generation that grows with online first, the second physical store, online gambling modes may not be so invasive. In the CSC report, a survey indicated that while 72% of respondents aged 55 and over said they were very uncomfortable with this type of technology used in physical stores, only 51% of young people aged 16-24 said the same.
Is this relative openness derived from greater familiarity with digital technology or from a blind belief in the goodwill of omnipresent organizations offering free services? Is the chill of a technology an instinctive and invariant certainty or flows with degrees of social acceptance? Whatever the case, there's a growing number of eyes on the shelves and they care a lot about what you're wearing.

"With its palaces, sculpted parks, concert halls and museums, Vienna is a city full of culture.
In Vienna, for centuries, composers Beethoven, Mozart and Johann Strauss, and artists Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka and Egon Schiele, as well as the father of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, have been at the forefront of major cultural movements.
But that does not mean that it is stuck in the past; Vienna also has a youthful side, and is visited annually by backpackers as much as fans of the main culture, something that Richard Linklater celebrated in his 1995 film Before Sunrise, in which two strangers fell in love over the course of a day, with Vienna as a romantic backdrop.
Whether you visit in winter the Christmas markets that shine under snowflakes, or in spring, when the flowers in the city's many parks are in bloom, the city will surely love it.
CNN World's Treasures selects some of the best places to experience the Old World of Vienna, from galleries and parks to historical monuments.
SEE
The year 2012 marks the 150th anniversary of the birth of Austrian painter Gustav Klimt, one of the founding members of the Vienna Secession, an avant-garde artistic group at the beginning of the century.
In fact, one of the architectural masterpieces of the city, the art nouveau Secession building, was commissioned by the group as a refuge for the latest in contemporary art.
The Museum presents the mural of Klimt Beethoven, but to see his famous gold painting The Kiss, head to the Belvedere Museum, located in a magnificent palace built in the 1700s. It has a complete collection of Klimt paintings, along with works by Kokoschka, Schiele, Vincent van Gogh and Auguste Rodin, among others.
The painters at the end of the century in Vienna owed much to the new theories of mind from Sigmund Freud, and no trip to Vienna would be complete without visiting the Sigmund Freud Museum, where the founder of psychoanalysis lived until he was forced to flee in 1938. Take a lecture or just wander around the original waiting room and imagine that you are about to be examined by the great man himself.
For those who seek to delight themselves with their eyes in earlier examples of the opulent past of the city, look no further than the Schatzkammer, the imperial treasure and the home of the Crown Jewels of Habsburg, which is located in the vast Hofburg Palace, seat of the dominant Habsburg dynasty.
Hear
For lovers of classical music, Vienna is a must, as it was in the 18th century, when it attracted the young Mozart.
You can visit the apartment in which Mozart lived when he composed Figaro's marriage among other great works, which has become a museum and has temporary exhibitions, in addition to the permanent collection of objects in the house itself. You can even listen to their music through the rooms as you wander around.
For concerts, head to the Musikverein for Wiener Philharmoniker performances and smaller camera concerts. Or for operas, reserve a seat at the great Staatsoper, or at the Theater-an-der-Wien, where works by Beethoven and Strauss were originally premiered.
STROLL
Vienna has a lot of open spaces and parks, from the sculpted alpine gardens of Belvedere Castle to the most relaxed and youthful sensation of Danube Island. The Rathauspark features an ice skating rink in winter and an outdoor cinema in summer. Alternatively, take a walk through the Baroque gardens of Schonbrunn Palace. A well-timed tourist activity is riding the wheel in the Prater Attractions Park, which appears in Graham Greene's film The Third Man.
Stay
Places to stay in Vienna are abundant and cater to all budgets. Hotel Altstadt is located in Spittelberg's artistic district, right behind the MuseumsQuartier and boasts an impressive collection of contemporary art and design; Das Tyrol, an old monastery with a small spa, features works of art by young Viennese artists; the Konig von Ungarn has the advantage of being in the same 300-year-old building complex as Mozart's living rooms; and the Hilton Vienna Danube has views over the river.
EAT
Viennese cuisine is not for those who observe their waists; watering snacks and cakes, breaded meats and beer and wine in abundance make the city a banquet for the palates. Steirereck serves an impressive variety of delicious Viennese dishes, although not exactly slimming, while Demel serves coffee and cakes for an afternoon treat between sightseeing.

"An American jailed for nearly a month in the United Arab Emirates for taking pictures has been released from custody and has returned to Georgia, a family spokesman said.
Robert Alan Black, who had been in the United Arab Emirates to speak at an international creative conference, had been held at Al Wathba prison in Abu Dhabi since October 21 after being accused of taking photos of restricted areas, said Rosemary Rein, spokesman for Friends of Alan Black.
Former architect, Black often takes photos of buildings, according to Rein. This is prohibited in some parts of the United Arab Emirates, in particular in government buildings, embassies, military installations and other places considered sensitive.
He made a brief appearance in court on Monday, and was released the next day.
The court concluded that the action was committed without bad intent, and ordered the minimum fine of 500 dirhams -LRB-United Arab Emirates or about $135 -RRB-, according to Rein's statement, which was posted on a Facebook page by Robert Alan Black.
After his release, the 70-year-old boy went home in Athens, Georgia.
“We are relieved and happy with this news,” Rein said. The international community of creativity was concerned about our dear friend and colleague, and we are glad that the matter has been resolved.
Black is characterized as an architect, cartoonist, graphic designer, teacher and creative consultant on its website. He has made presentations at more than 150 creative lectures on six continents since 1978, and has written more than 600 articles and a book, Broken Crayons: Break Your Crayons and Draw Outside the Lines.
Rein said Black's next stop, after the Abu Dhabi conference, was supposed to be Malaysia. But after noting that he had not posted on social media, she touched the ground with mutual acquaintances and learned that he had never made it to Malaysia.

"Every last one, David Bowie, who died of cancer, was still able to generate surprises. His last album, Blackstar, appeared on his 69th birthday on January 8, 2016 and showed that his gift to make dramatic statements as well as challenging and disturbing music had not abandoned him.
Throughout the 1970s, Bowie was a pioneer of musical trends and pop fashion. Having been a mimo and cabaret artist from the late 1960s, he became a singer-composer, a pioneer of glam-rock, then turned to what he called “plastic soul,” before moving to Berlin to create innovative electronic music. Its ability to mix brilliant changes in sound and image supported by genuine intellectual curiosity is rivaled by few in pop history.
Bowie was born David Robert Jones in southern London. In 1953, the family moved to Kent, where David showed ability to sing and play the recorder. Later, he studied art, music and design. In 1961, David's mother bought him a plastic saxophone, introducing him to an instrument that would become a recurring ingredient in his music.
At the age of 15, David formed his first band, the Kon-rads. It was clear that David’s talent and ambition dictated that he should go alone. David adopted the name Bowie to avoid confusion with Davy Jones of the Monkees.
Bowie's first album, released in June 1967, was simply titled David Bowie. In July 1969, Bowie released Space Oddity, the song that would give him his initial commercial breakthrough. Time to coincide with the landing of Apollo 11, was a success among the top five in the UK.
In March 1970, Bowie married Angela Barnett, an art student. Artistically, Bowie was ahead. The Man Who Sold the World was released in the U.S. At the end of 1970 and in the United Kingdom the following year, and with his bold composition and broody, hard-rock sound, was the first album to do complete justice to his writing and performance of gifts. The album's themes included immortality, madness, murder, and mysticism, evidence that Bowie was a composer who was thinking far beyond the usual limits of pop.
He followed it with Hunky Dory of 1972, a mixture of elaborate composition and wordy. It was an excellent collection that had only moderate success, but everything changed with The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders of Mars at the end of that year.
This time, Bowie emerged as a full-fledged science fiction character – an intergalactic glam-rock star visiting a doomed planet to Earth – and the album effectively wrote the script for its own stardom. The success of the single Starman brought instant success for the album, while Bowie's dazzling costumes and provocative performances sparked fan enthusiasm from Beatlemania.
Everything Bowie touched turned into gold. He had his first album number 1 from the United Kingdom with Aladdin Sane (1973), which generated the single hits The Jean Genie and Drive-in Saturday. But Bowie was already planning new professional moves.
His growing interest in funk and soul music came to the fore in delightfully listenable American youths (1975), which gave him a US record with Fama (with John Lennon as guest vocalist).
Station to Station (1976) introduced a new character, the Thin White Duke, which Bowie had taken from his main performance as a melancholy space traveler in Nicolas Roeg's film The Man Who Falled to Earth.
Bowie's relationship with his wife had been disintegrating under the pressures of success and the couple divorced in 1980. This was a year of more creative triumph, bringing a good album, Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), and his spin-out single, Ashes to Ashes, followed by Bowie's welcome time as John Merrick at The Elephant Man on Broadway stage. He obtained a single number 1 with his 1981 association with Queen, Under Pressure as he became increasingly involved in crossovers between different media. He appeared in the German film Christiane F (1981) and wrote music for the soundtrack. He had another graphic success with Cat People (Putting Out Fire) from Paul Schrader's film Cat People (1982). Bowie continued to make progress as a screen actor with appearances in The Hunger and the drama of the Second World War Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence, both released in 1983.
Musically, this was the year he put his energy into a commercial attack with the album Let’s Dance and follow-up concerts. Let's Dance molded Bowie into a crowd-friendly global rock star, with the album and its singles Let's Dance, China Girl and Modern Love becoming great international hits.
This was the peak of MTV and Bowie's Knack for eye-catching videos fueled this commercial waste, while the six-month Serious Moonlight tour attracted massive crowds. It was going to be the most commercially successful period of his career. His profile gained another boost from his appearance at the 1985 humanitarian aid concert at Wembley Stadium, where he was one of the leading artists. He also partnered with Mick Jagger to record the single for fundraising Dancing in the Street, which went to number 1. A few days after his appearance at the Freddie Mercury tribute concert at Wembley Stadium in April 1992, Bowie married Somali model Iman and the couple bought a house in New York. This new beginning in his private life coincided with a search for fresh musical inspiration.
For the album Black Tie White Noise (1993), he sprayed elements of soul, electronics and hip hop in the mix. He led the UK album list and produced a top 10 single, Jump They Say. New media and technology also influenced their recordings. His 1999 album Hours... was based on music he had written for a computer game called Omikron, in which Bowie and Iman appeared as characters. The birth of Bowie and the daughter of Iman, Alexandria, followed in August 2000.
As an adopted New Yorker, Bowie was the opening act at the New York concert in October 2001, where he joined Paul McCartney, Jon Bon Jovi, Billy Joel, The Who and Elton John in a charity program six weeks after the September 11 attacks. Bowie was back in the studio the following year for Reality. However, in the middle of his 2004 Reality tour, Bowie was beaten with chest pain while performing in Germany and underwent emergency surgery in Hamburg to clean a blocked artery.
He took the medical emergency as a warning and slowed down his activities. In 2006, he announced that he would take a year off tours and recordings. In February of that year, he received a Grammy Award for Life, having been included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996.
The Next Day (2013) was their first new album in a decade. It contained the single Where Are We Now?, which gave it its first hit in the UK's top 10 since 1993. The album led the charts in Britain and around the world. In 2014, Bowie received the Brit Award for Best British Man, making him the oldest British winner in the history of the awards. He is survived by Iman, his daughter, Alexandria, his stepdaughter, Zulekha, and his son, Duncan, from his first marriage.

"When night falls on Rwanda, many rural communities far from the country's electricity grid descend into darkness.
Disconnected from power lines, households in these areas rely mainly on fuel-based devices such as kerosene lamps for access to light. However, these flashlights are polluting and costly: they emit toxic gases, pose fire risks and also put pressure on family budgets.
However, an innovative solution has recently emerged to provide affordable and efficient electricity to low-income households while benefiting communities by providing employment to local populations.
Called POWERcycle, Nuru Energy says it has developed the first commercially available pedal generator, a foot or handheld device that can recharge up to five modular light-emitting diodes -LRB-LED-RRB- lamps in about 20 minutes, as well as mobile power phones and radios.
The company says that each of its portable LED lamps provides a week of light to a rural home. It also states that its products are more affordable and reliable than other off-grid forms of supply that have developed in recent years, including solar lamps or solar home lighting systems.
We looked around and said, well, what is the only energy resource that is not exploited in this environment? And human power really came to mind, says Sameer Hajee, executive director and co-founder of Nuru Energy.
We think, well, if we can harness human energy in a way that we can create economic opportunities and low-power electricity, wouldn't that be a game-changing solution?
Watch: Can hand-made bicycles change lives?
According to Lighting Africa, a joint programme of the World Bank and the IFC developed to increase access to clean sources of energy for lighting, 589 million people on the continent live without access to a public electricity facility.
The group says poor rural African households and small businesses pay $10 billion a year for lighting purposes, while communities that are not connected to the network spend $4.4 billion a year on kerosene.
To address the issue of energy poverty, Hajee, a social entrepreneur with a lot of experience in international development, spent more than a month in Rwanda in 2008, trying to figure out what the energy needs of the country's people without a network connection were.
What he discovered was actually quite basic - LSB- energy needs -RSB-, he says. It's light, kitchen, mobile phone recharge and radio.
With the help of the World Bank, Hajee co-founded Nuru Energy and in 2009 the company began testing its products in the field.
However, Hajee quickly realized that innovative technology was not enough for the project to succeed in a place like rural Rwanda. His company also needed to take a creative approach on the distribution front.
We couldn't just sell the product -- we had to really get involved in the downstream value chain, he says. We thought, well, if the generator can recharge five lights so quickly, couldn't this be the basis of a recharging business for a local entrepreneur?
As a result, the company decided not to sell its products directly to customers. Instead, it established a network of village-level entrepreneurs who are responsible for marketing, selling and recharging the lights.
Hajee says this unique distribution model has revolutionized the lives of both micro-entrepreneurs and customers.
If you look at this from the customer's point of view, Hajee says, they would buy the light for $6 and then pay about 20 cents a week for lighting. This compares to about $2 a week that would be spent on kerosene earlier. So it's 10 times cheaper solution for them.
From the businessman's perspective, in 20 minutes of pedaling, they're charging five lights, earning about $1, any of us who work in Africa know that's a lot more than people earn in a whole day. So it's a great value proposition for the client and the entrepreneur.
Hajee points out that this model can easily be emulated throughout rural Africa. He says that Nuru Energy, which is currently focusing on East Africa and India, has already been approached by a number of potential joint venture partners to launch the project in other parts of the continent.
I really hope that what we are providing here is a temporary solution to the immediate energy needs of... the rural populations, Hajee says. What I really hope is that, you know, there is definitely effort needed to provide quality grid electricity to these populations. It'll take some time.

"Five days of shootings between the Indian army and separatist militants in Indian-run Kashmir have left at least 25 dead: eight Indian army soldiers, including one officer, and 17 militants, the Indian army said Tuesday.
An Indian army soldier puts a crown during the funeral of a dead soldier, northeast of Srinagar on Tuesday.
Minister of Defence A.K. Antony, meeting with Indian military leaders in Delhi, examined the situation in the Himalayan region and told the Army to address the situation in the Himalayan region with the utmost firmness.
Kashmir has been in the midst of a violent separatist campaign for nearly two decades during which authorities say 43,000 people have been killed. However, several non-governmental organizations and human rights groups have doubled the number of deaths.
In Srinigar, Kashmir, the Army spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel J.S. Brar told CNN that the Army was moving against militants based on solid intelligence as well as human intelligence provided by our own sources.
Battles in the Shamsbhari forests in the northern district of Kashmir Kupwara have caused minimal collateral damage to the property, Brar said.
The spokesman denied media reports that the army had used combat helicopters and heavy weapons during these operations against militants.
This month's meeting between the Indian army and militants is the second longest in Kashmir this year. In January, a fierce encounter took place for seven days in the Poonch district of Jammu in Indian-administered Kashmir. Two soldiers, one policeman and four militants were killed at the meeting.
Kashmir has been the source of bitter dispute and two wars between India and neighbouring Pakistan. Both control parts of the region that are predominantly Muslim.

"The security for Pope Francis' visit to Brazil has risen after an incident related to his caravan, a Brazilian federal official told CNN.
The papal visit is now ranked at the highest level of safety - it was raised to high risk of average risk after your car got stuck in a crowd of enthusiastic followers on Monday, the official said.
The source says that the problem was partly due to the Pope's ordering drivers not to avoid crowds.
After Francisco arrived in Brazil on Monday, he got into a silver Fiat hatchback for the trip from the airport to downtown Rio de Janeiro. Along the road, the vehicle was caught between a bus and a crush on well-wishers who were coming to the car to touch the Pope.
The federal authorities are now taking on a more important role in Francis' security during his stay in Brazil.
Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims from all over the world have come to Rio for World Youth Day, a week-long festival held every two years. The Vatican told journalists that 500,000 people came to Copacabana Beach for the opening ceremony and mass.. Crowds stretched over the beach for more than half a mile from the main stage.
Brazil: Police Found, Destroyed Bomb Before Pope's Visit · Global Voices
A Call to Hope
The Pope traveled Wednesday morning to the city of Aparecida, the place of a shrine to Our Lady of Aparecida, a clay statue of the Virgin Mary and one of the patron saints of Brazil.
A large crowd - courageous rain - hailed as the Pope left the helicopter that took him to the place where he celebrated the Mass..
In his homily, the Pope called on the faithful to find hope in God.
It is true that today, to a certain extent, everyone, including our young people, is drawn to the many idols that take the place of God and seem to offer hope: money, success, power, pleasure, Francis said. Often, a growing sense of loneliness and emptiness in the hearts of many people leads them to seek satisfaction in these ephemeral idols.
His message was optimistic, encouraging openness to be surprised by God and proclaiming that Christians cannot be pessimistic.
The Pope also announced that he will return to Brazil in 2017, the 300th anniversary of the appearance of Our Lady of Aparecida to three fishermen.

"Government of Texas. Rick Perry's decision to send up to 1,000 National Guard soldiers to the southern border is the latest movement in a controversy over the influx of young migrants from Central America, many unaccompanied, arriving in the United States.
It represents concrete action on the concerns raised by Perry and other Republicans that border security will receive more resources in general and specifically in this case to address what is most appropriate is a humanitarian crisis.
The White House, which has refused to approve the federal authorization of the National Guard in response to the immigration situation that has erupted this year, considered Perry's idea as short-sighted and politically motivated.
These are the questions we wanted to know about Perry's plan.
Why did Perry call the guard? Perry said those troops are needed to fight crime because the border patrol is busy dealing with the flow of immigrant children crossing the border from Mexico.
The National Guard will be a force multiplier to help state law enforcement reduce the crime of cartels, traffickers and criminals crossing the border, Perry said.
But isn't this a crisis about children? Perry said the border patrol is consumed by handling the influx of migrant children and partial family units, who cannot be deported but must be treated and treated humanely in accordance with U.S. law.
However, if unaccompanied children approach the troops, Texas Assistant General John Nichols, who is head of the Texas National Guard, said they will be on the phone to a border station for children to receive water and medical care.
How does that stop the influx? Perry doesn't say he will. He said he wanted to stop the border crime.
So what's the border patrol gonna do? The National Guard troops will refer the alleged criminal activity to the Texas Department of Security. They will also patrol the border by air, especially at night. And they will meet at the border to provide a strong vision that Perry hopes will deter criminals from carrying out illicit activities across the border.
What don't they do? The National Guard won't make any arrests. “If we were asked, we could stop people, but we did not plan,” Nichols said.
How much will it cost and who will pay for it? Texas taxpayers are on the hook, and it'll cost about $12 million a month.
Will it work? The former head of the National Guard and a former commissioner of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Bureau have said Perry's plan has limited scope.
The real solution to basically help the border patrol is going to be a holistic approach to this that goes far beyond more boots on the ground, said David Aguilar, the interim CBP commissioner from 2011 to 2013.
Aguilar said one thing that will help ease the workload of border patrol officers is to relieve CBP from being the only government agency to prosecute and care for unaccompanied youth immediately after their arrest.
The former head of the National Guard echoed Aguilar's sentiment.
That measure alone will not solve the current problem. It is much more complex and requires a unity approach that incorporates state, local and federal resources, said retired Lieutenant General H. Steven Blum.
When will this happen and for how long? The troops will be deployed immediately in the next 30 days, according to Nichols. It is not known how long they will remain. Perry is asking the federal government to hire and train 3,000 other border patrol officers to replace the National Guard. That part of the plan depends on Congress and the comprehensive immigration plan that would have provided more resources for border security is paralysed in the House, and neither body has yet revealed how they would resolve the current border crisis.
Is politics playing a role? Perry is considering another presidential race in 2016. He previewed his National Guard plan in Iowa, a key presidential designation state, over the weekend and announced it the following day.
Perry has something to do to reconcile within a Republican Party that has used the current border crisis to move to the right on the issue.
Ron Brownstein, a CNN political analyst and editorial director of the National Journal, said Perry's approach to border security allows him to shore up his resistance to good faith in security in what has become a big moment for the Republican Party in immigration.
Has the National Guard been sent to the border before? Yeah. The National Guard is already at the border, but in smaller numbers.
A recent and much broader example was Operation Jump Start, a two-year deployment that began in 2006 to stop the more than 1 million people who were caught crossing the border each year.
What's the situation at the border? The Rio Grande sector, where most immigrant children are becoming the border patrol, currently has 3,000 border patrol officers covering 320 miles of land and 250 miles of water, equivalent to 5.4 officers per mile. The Tucson sector, for example, has approximately 15.7 agents per mile.
While the number of unaccompanied young people crossing the border has doubled to almost 60,000 in the past year, the total number of immigrant crossings has decreased mostly. Nearly 1 million people have been caught crossing the border almost every year between 1983 and 2006, but that figure has fallen to about 400,000 in 2013.
At the same time, resources for border security have increased steadily: more than 18,000 officers patrolled the border in 2013, compared to 10,000 a decade ago.
And the amount spent on border security has more than doubled. The Customs and Border Patrol budget increased from $5 billion in 2002 to $12.4 billion this year.

"Two car bombs directed against Christians killed at least 38 people in southern Baghdad at Christmas.
In Afghanistan, two rounds of indirect fire hit the United States Embassy compound in Kabul, but no one was injured.
The incidents highlight the security challenges facing both Iraq and Afghanistan.
Both countries have had a strong US military presence until recently.
The departure of U.S. forces from Iraq has done little to curb the almost daily cycle of violence. In Afghanistan, U.S. and Afghan officials are working on an important security pact to outline the future of U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
18 Killed in Christmas Day Attacks Near Iraqi Churches · Global Voices
Attacks in Iraq
In Iraq, a car bomb exploded outside a church in southern Baghdad just as the worshipers left a Christmas day service, killing many. In another attack on Wednesday, a car bomb exploded in an outdoor market where many Christians buy, police said.
In total, at least 38 people were killed and 70 others injured, the Ministry of the Interior said. The bomb outside the church killed 27 and injured 56. The market attack left 11 dead and 14 injured.
The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad condemned the attacks on Christians celebrating Christmas in the Dora area of Baghdad.
The Christian community in Iraq has suffered deliberate and senseless attacks by terrorists for many years, as have many other innocent Iraqis. The United States abhors all such attacks and is committed to its partnership with the Government of Iraq to combat the scourge of terrorism, according to a statement issued by the Embassy.
Iraq has experienced a surge of sectarian violence this year as tensions simmering between the disaffected Sunni minority and Shia, who dominate the government.
The U.S. International Religious Freedom Commission notes that many people from small minority religious communities in Iraq, including Christians, have fled the country over the past decade and those who remain particularly vulnerable, facing discrimination, marginalization and neglect.
The sectarian war, especially between Sunnis and Shiites, became enraged during the Iraq war. It is believed that half or more of the pre-2003 Iraqi Christian community left Iraq, the commission said in its 2013 annual report.
In 2003, it was thought that there were between 800,000 and 1.4 million Chaldean Catholics, Assyrian Orthodox, members of the Assyrian Church of the East, Syriac and Orthodox Catholics, Armenian and Orthodox Catholics, Protestants and Evangelicals in the country, the group said.
Now, according to community leaders, the estimated number of Christians is about 500,000, the report said.
Attack on Afghanistan
Two rounds of indirect fire hit the U.S. embassy compound in Kabul, the embassy said. No one was hurt.
At approximately 6:40 local time in Kabul, approximately two rounds of indirect fire hit the United States Embassy compound. All Americans are counted and there were no injuries, the embassy said in a statement on Wednesday. The Embassy is still investigating the attack.
The embassy did not explain in detail what type of shots were fired, or where they landed in the complex.
A liability claim was posted on the Taliban official website. The group said it fired missiles at the U.S. Embassy and NATO's main base, leading the military coalition known as the International Security Assistance Force.
The incident comes at a crucial moment in relations between the United States and Afghanistan. The two countries are working on an important security pact. The agreement will establish the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan after 2014, when the NATO-led force of some 80,000 troops is scheduled to leave.
This month, U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel was in Afghanistan and said the security pact will be agreed despite a failure so far to forge an agreement.

"How long can you hold your breath? I'm trying right now. The first 30 seconds are easy. I'm ready to give up at 45 seconds, but I'm moving on and it seems to be easier for a while. But, as the second hand goes by for a minute, I know I'm in borrowed time. My heart is beating. I let out a little breath and this helps. Eventually, I give up, ejecting the spent air into my lungs and taking a big gasp. (And keep panting for a few more breaths, which leads my husband to ask what the hell I'm doing.) I manage for a minute and 12 seconds. I'm pretty impressed with myself.
Breathing capacity becomes extremely important in some sports, especially free diving. In 2006, he was filming a program on anatomy and physiology of the lungs for a BBC series called, a little strangely, Don’t Die Young. I was lucky enough to meet Sam Amps, who was captain of the UK liberation team. In a pool in Bristol, she taught me some simple exercises to help me hold my breath longer while swimming underwater. By the end of the session, I think I had achieved a prodigious 90 seconds of breathing, long enough to let me swim a width. Sam swam three wide with ease. He could hold his breath for five minutes, while swimming. Five!
I asked him how he did it: very slow breathing for several minutes before each dive, then a great deep breathing before diving. She also said the training helped her resist the urge to breathe for much longer than most people.
Some have suggested that the ability to voluntarily contain breathing is evidence of an aqueous episode in human evolution. It has even been said that humans have the ability to reduce heart rate and metabolic rate in order to hold their breath longer. Other anatomical and physiological bits and bobs – our lack of hair, the distribution of our subcutaneous fat and even our tendency to walk on two legs – have been linked to an aquatic phase of evolutionary development. Unfortunately, the “aquatic monkey hypothesis” cobbled cannot contain water. It is a romantic notion that can attract us but, with the cold light of day falling on scientific evidence, it is revealed that it is nothing but a fiction.
Looking at the voluntary suspension of breathing, it turns out that we are certainly not unique among non-aquatic mammals in being able to contain breathing. (Having said that, it is somewhat difficult to investigate in other mammals as, unlike humans, they tend to fail when asked to breathe.) And experimental evidence shows that heart rate does not decrease during breathing. At least it doesn't if you're holding your breath on earth. When you're immersed in cold water it's a different story: cooling the face leads to a slower heart rate in most people. But, once again, this is not evidence of an aquatic ape ancestor, as it turns out to be a very general characteristic of air-breathing vertebrates. This reduction in heart rate is only one of the physiological responses that are sometimes described together as the “mammal diving reflex”. But physiological responses that could be useful in diving are also – and perhaps even more important – useful to avoid drowning.
Although our ability to breathe may not be so special, when compared to other animals, it is now proving to be very useful in a particular area of medicine. Radiation therapy for breast cancer involves directing radiation, very precisely, to the tumor. This may require several minutes of radiation and therefore is usually done in short bursts, between breaths. But, if the patient can keep her chest perfectly still for several minutes, it means that the entire dose can be given, in the right place, at once. The problem, of course, is that most people, like me, struggle to hold their breath for much more than a minute. However, doctors at Birmingham University Hospital have recently conducted careful experiments that show that, if patients are ventilated with oxygen-rich air before attempting a breath suspension, they can manage to hold their breath for five and a half impressive minutes.
Surprisingly, the trick does not seem to be tricking the body's usual sensors by low levels of oxygen or carbon dioxide in the blood, but by deceiving the diaphragm. When you breathe, you are contracting the muscle from your diaphragm, pulling it flattened so that the volume of your chest increases - and the air is dragged into your lungs. When you hold your breath, you keep the diaphragm in this state of contraction. Artificial increase in oxygen levels and reduction of carbon dioxide levels before breathing, as in Birmingham radiation therapy experiments, can work by delaying fatigue in the diaphragm. And – it’s not as useful if you’re trying to keep your chest perfectly still – breathing a little air allows the diaphragm to relax a little bit, and helps you prolong a breath of breathing, exactly as I found it when trying my breath.
And, therefore, it is your diaphragm, the main muscle of breathing, which is also in charge when it comes to reaching the breaking point of your breathing. Eventually, even if you've fooled him for a while, the diaphragm signals are too strong and you have to give in – and take a breath.

"Some cities have pigeons. Lima has black vultures or chickens. They circulate in groups on the most emblematic buildings of the city: the decrepit churches, of the colonial period and the 18th century piles that crumble in the center of the city.
In many ways, with their heads wrinkled and their eyes crowded, they remind the residents of Lima of the side of their city that they would prefer to ignore: negligence, poverty and dirt. But the natural affinity of these carrions for dead and decaying things is becoming a virtue. Environmental authorities are giving these highly slandered birds a public relations image change, equipping them with GoPro action video cameras and GPS trackers, and giving them a new mission in the fight against the dumping of flies and illegal dumping. Samuel is one of the ten atratus of Coragyps certified disease-free project who have been accused of doing what they do best: sniffing garbage. Equipped with its tracker, it is released over the city, where it identifies clandestine landfills and records the GPS coordinates ona live map.
His coach at the Huachipa Zoo in Lima, Alfredo Correa, shines with admiration. “They can eat dead animals because their metabolism protects them from viruses and bacteria,” he says. “They have the strongest intestinal flora in the natural world.” The effort is a collaboration between USAID and the Peruvian Ministry of Environment to address the problem of garbage in Lima.
Samuel's other air companions have been given more evocative names: Captain Huggin, Captain Fenix (so called by the mythological creature rising from the ashes) and Captain Aella ( ""Whirlwind""). A video in the tongue adds a melodramatic voice off, in which the noble “carhatidae lineage – vultures” face pestilence and disease, while “humanity is placidly ignoring danger”. The project makes a serious point. With only four landfills in a city of almost ten million inhabitants, there are countless illegal landfills. One fifth of the garbage ends there, according to the Ministry of Environment. The runoff of the waste pollutes Lima's main water source, the Rimac River, as well as the Chillon and Lurin Rivers, which flow into the Lima Bay.
The environmental monitoring agency, the OEFA, says that three poorer neighborhoods, despite having only 12% of the population of Lima, have by far the most fly tips: Villa Maria del Triunfo (39.4%), Villa El Salvador (25.3%) and El Agustino (18.3%). The problem, in part, is unpaid taxes. Many residents, especially in neighborhoods, simply don't pay. This means that some of the 43 district municipalities lack resources for basic services such as garbage collection.
It also means that no one will necessarily clean up where vultures identify illegal garbage. “We share the GPS coordinates of the vulture with the municipalities,” says Javier Hernández, director of the project. “It’s your job to pick up the trash and try to change the habits of your residents.”
The aim of the project is to encourage citizens to be “vulgaes on the ground ” — to report fly cleaning, cut their own waste, and recycle. Some residents are responding, posting photos of illegal landfills on the Twitter and Facebook page. The idea emerged at the 2014 United Nations Climate Change Conference, held in Lima. “We are looking for ways to involve not only the authorities but also citizens to generate environmental awareness,” Hernández says. The artist Cristina Planas had placed huge vulture heads carved over 25 dead palms in a wetland reserve in the south of the city. The rich hated it as an ugly imposition, but Planas invited citizens to “adopt a vulture” in support of conservation and recycling.
“We’re a little scared of the vulture’s appearance,” he said. “But actually, he’s out there sacrificing himself for us. It’s out there recycling, in the last place we throw away our garbage.”",C1
"The sunlight shines through the drops of water falling down the edge of the cliff. Painted on the rocky face behind the small waterfall there is a pair of discolored elas, the largest antelope in Africa. Behind them are two barely visible human figures.
This is a sacred place, says Raphael Mnkhati, a guide to the Kamberg Rock Art Center. Water is important for life, and it was important for the people who lived here.
The small cave behind the waterfall is just one of thousands of secret shelters hidden in the Drakensberg-Ukahlamba Mountains of South Africa. They were home to the Bushmen, the original inhabitants of this country, who fled to these mountains to escape from other Africans coming down from the north of the continent and white settlers coming up from the Cape. The Bushmen were annihilated in the countless conflicts that resulted.
Some 60,000 individual images are scattered along these mountains, visible in some 600 different places. The artists used the earth's blood and fat, as well as bleached clay, bird droppings and charcoal as pigments. The delicate lines of the figures were engraved with twigs, porcupines and ostrich feathers.
Scientists believe that these figures were created by the Bushmen while in trance states, and that the paintings reflect the deep reverence of the people for the beauty and power of the natural world around them.
On the top of the mountain, hidden in a gigantic ledge on its very crest, is a remarkable fresco of hunters, antelopes and mythical figures, known as terianthropes, who are partially human beings, part animals.
The paintings extend in a long gallery through the rock face that extends for at least 30 meters under the stone ceiling. It frames a spectacular view of the high peaks and the distant valley very down.
He's not allowed to touch anything, or pick anything up here, it's like a church, Raphael tells us. And that's why it's important for the Bushman people. Still today many people take off their shoes when they visit here, as a sign of their respect.
One of the most well-preserved and mysterious panels in the Kamberg series shows a mythical human figure pulling from the tail of a land. Some scientists believe that this is a sign of human recreation, almost sport, created by the artist -- or artists -- in a transcendent state of consciousness.
Rafael has come here for years, and now he is studying rock art through college, but the beauty of this ancient gift left by lost generations has not vanished for him.
The Bushmen are very special, reflecting as they look down into the wide landscape, because they lived here peacefully in the mountains. We are all of the same origins. I'm very proud of this place and the rock art that's here.

"In the 1950s, Central American commercial bananas faced the death of their most lucrative product, the Gros Michel banana, known as Big Mike. And now it's happening again to Big Mike's successor, the Cavendish.
With its easy transport, thick-skinned fruit and sweet taste, the Gros Michel banana plant dominated the plantations of Central America. United Fruit, South America's leading producer and exporter at the time, massed its bananas as efficiently as possible: cloned shoots from plant stems instead of growing seed plants, and cultivated them in dense fields.
Unfortunately, these conditions are also perfect for the propagation of the fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense, which attacks the roots of the plant and prevents it from transporting water to the stem and leaves. The TR-1 strain of the fungus was resistant to crop sprayers and traveled with boots or truck tyres, slowly infecting plantations throughout the region. In an attempt to escape the fungus, farmers abandoned the infected fields, flooded them and then replanted crops elsewhere, often cutting down the rainforest to do so.
Their efforts failed. So, instead, they looked for a variety of bananas that the fungus didn't affect. They found the Cavendish, as it was called, in the greenhouse of a British duke. It was not as suitable for shipping as Gros Michel, but its bananas knew well enough to keep consumers happy. Most importantly, TR-1 didn't seem to affect him. Within a few years, United Fruit had been saved from bankruptcy by filling its plantations with thousands of new plants, copying the same monoculture conditions in which Gros Michel had prospered.
While the operation was a great success for the Latin American industry, the banana cavendish itself is far from safe. In 2014, South-East Asia, another major banana producer, exported four million tonnes of bananas cavendish. But by 2015, their exports had decreased by 46% thanks to a combination of another fungus strain, TR-4, and bad weather.
Increasing practices in South-East Asia have not helped things. Farmers cannot always afford expensive laboratory-based methods to clone plants from outbreaks without spreading the disease. In addition, they are often not strict enough about cleaning up agricultural equipment and quarantine of infected fields. As a result, the fungus has spread to Australia, the Middle East and Mozambique – and Latin America, which depends largely on its monoculture Cavendish crops, could easily be the next.
Fighting the inevitable, scientists are working to solve the problem by genetically modifying Cavendish with genes from TR-4 resistant banana species. Researchers at Queensland University of Technology have successfully cultivated two types of modified plants that have remained resistant for three years so far. But some experts think this is just a sophisticated version of the same temporary solution that the original Cavendish provided. If new bananas are planted in the same monocultures as Cavendish and Gros Michel before it, the risk is that another strain of the disease may increase to threaten modified plants as well.",C1
"The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, better known as the Veterans Administration, is an organization dedicated to serving all veterans of the U.S. Army. It was formed in July 1930, and today employs approximately 280,000 people in hundreds of its offices across the United States. Its annual budget for fiscal year 2014 is almost $153 billion, making it one of the largest government agencies in existence today.

The Department is divided into three main branches. It consists of the Veterans Health Administration, the Veterans Benefits Administration and the National Cemetery Administration. The VA Health Administration is responsible for providing veterans with all health care issues, while the Benefits Administration is designed to assist veterans in areas such as secured mortgage loans, professional rehabilitation of insurance and educational benefits. The National Cemetery Administration provides funeral and commemorative benefits, and is responsible for the maintenance of AV cemeteries.
The VA has served American veterans of several wars starting with survivors of World War I. The tradition of serving former military personnel has continued to serve veterans who need help in adjusting to civilian life. Many of these veterans, especially those who saw combat during their time in the army, need basic medical services for the wounds sustained in the conflicts. This was the original concept for the creation of the AV.
Since then, AV has expanded considerably and now offers additional services, such as educational benefits and assistance in the purchase of housing. It also helps veterans who had been left homeless after their services in their country ended. There are approximately 30 million military veterans living in the United States today. That figure represents almost 10 per cent of the country ' s population today.",C1
"Half of the registered voters in Iraq went to peaceful provincial elections this weekend, the election commission said on Sunday.
Residents of the province of Ramadi in Iraq cast their votes this weekend during the provincial elections.
The participation of 7.5 million voters contrasted sharply with the 2005 elections, when the violence and intimidation of Al Qaeda in Iraq kept voters away from the polls and only 2% of eligible voters participated.
Faraj al-Haidari, head of the Independent High Electoral Commission, called participation this year very high for provincial elections in any country. Fifty-one per cent of the 14.9 million registered voters cast votes.
Al-Haidari called at the weekend the vote for the most important elections in Iraq's history since the fall of Saddam Hussein.
The vote took place in 14 of Iraq ' s 18 provinces. The biggest participation -- 65 percent -- took place in Salaheddin Province, northern Iraq, the commission said.
The lowest -- 40% -- was in Anbar, the Sunni heart west of Baghdad. The vast desert area was dominated in 2005 by Al Qaeda in Iraq.
The preliminary results of the electoral commission are expected within five days. Final numbers are due at the end of February.
Arwa Damon of CNN, who toured the polling stations with UN observers, said she noticed a greater sense of conscience and optimism among voters, who said they felt their participation would have an impact on their lives and the country.
Political analysts said this election could correct some of the political imbalances that resulted from the 2005 elections. Saturday's vote was also seen as a referendum on the popularity of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki.
We are trying to build a new system of government in the heart of the Islamic Middle East, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Barham Saleh told CNN.
The vast majority of the Iraqi people are participating in this process and are participating in this democratic process.
The elected will have regional power over the essentials that Iraqis have been desperate for... basic services and jobs, Damon reported.
Observers believe that provincial voting will be an indicator of the country's political leadership and an indication of what parliamentary elections will be like at the end of this year.
The results should explain the situation of the Sunni Arab awakening movement -- which opposes Al Qaeda in Iraq -- and the popularity of Shia factions, such as those supporting al-Maliki, Shiite clergyman Muqtada al-Sadr and the Supreme Islamic Council of Iraq.
Officials put in place harsh counter-terrorism measures for the elections, including security rounds around polling stations and vigorous voter registers.
Despite increased security, three mortars exploded near a polling station in downtown Tikrit, about 100 miles (LRB-160 kilometers) north of Baghdad, on Saturday morning, an official from the Ministry of the Interior told CNN. There were no casualties.
In another incident in Tikrit, the police arrested four people wearing Iraqi police uniforms who were said to have thrown stun grenades at voters in front of a polling station.

"Agios Efstratios is so remote, so forgotten by banks, the government and most of the modern world that the mobile phone network cannot process data and there is not a single ATM or credit card machine on the island. Before Greece plunged into financial chaos, the residents of this quiet position in the north of the Aegean managed quite well. They made their seats at the post office and the few dozen rooms to rent were booked every summer with people who had heard – from mouth to mouth – of their spectacular empty beaches, clear seas and fresh seafood.
But, because the island is still running with cash, the closure of banks across the country has been devastating. Residents have been forced to make nine-hour trips to the nearest big island to get cash and Greek visitors say they cannot raise enough money to come. “Tourism numbers have dropped by 80% this year,” said Mayor Maria Kakali, in an office in the village where she grew up, home to some 200 people. “Even people born here and living in Athens, who have their own places on the island, do not come.”
Kakali has harassed the government and a major Greek bank to promise an ATM in a matter of weeks, but still believes it can arrive too late for this season on an island where tourism angers the other two sources of income: fishing and agriculture: “We almost have no reservations in August, when there are usually people calling us to find a room and we can’t help them.” A harsh winter ahead may be slightly improved by 50 workers staying in the village to expand the port, but there is an even greater crisis that is coming because the government has said it will end a decades-long tax relief for the islands.
Created to help island communities survive when they suffered from mass emigration, a lower sales tax contained living costs in places where everything had to be imported and made tourism more affordable. Tourist favorites like Mykonos fear losing tax relief will make it difficult for them to compete with Turkey, but for Agios Efstratios it poses a much greater threat. “If we have to pay a tax of 23%, I’m sorry to say, but we will all die on the island,” Kakali says.
Food and fuel are already more expensive than on the continent, there are no economies of scale and little economic flexibility on an island that, even in summer, has only three shops, two restaurants and no official hotel. “This is an expensive island. Everything, including milk or bread, has changed hands three or four times before reaching us and each intermediary has to take advantage of it,” said Provatas Costas, a 58-year-old fisherman.
For Agios Efstratios and his closest neighbor, Lemnos, the moment of the crisis is particularly cruel. They were condemned to relative darkness for years in part because they are served by slow and unreliable ferries. In 2015, the government had finally given the contract to a new and efficient company, attracting floods of new visitors to explore the charms of the islands largely overlooked, before bank controls hit.
“It started out as the best season in 30 years and, in a week, it became the worst,” said Atzamis Konstantinos, a travel agent in Lemnos who earned 15,000 euros a month as a captain of oil tankers and other large ships, but came home because he missed it so much. “I always loved this island, even when I was young. I'd dock at the Piraeus, the port of Athens, take my paycheck, and then get the first boat. People would say 'You're crazy. You can go anywhere, but I just wanted to come here.
Lemnos has dozens of wild beaches, where even in the height of summer you can swim and sunbathe practically alone, a small night scene and numerous cultural sites. It is the eighth largest island in Greece, so it is online for the first round of tax increases in autumn 2015, but much less rich than many smaller. It has just over 3,000 guest beds, compared to tens of thousands on an island like Rhodes. Their councillors say they will fight against tax increases, although no one can say how. “We’ve been suffering economically in recent years and, now, we’re going to suffer more,” said Lemnos Mayor Dimitris Marinakis. “When there is not enough money, consumption is reduced and, therefore, the whole economy declines.”
The crisis has been particularly difficult for people under 40 years of age, who often do two or three jobs to make ends meet and still feel that they cannot afford a family. Young people fear losing their contemporaries in an exodus to match the one that scattered their grandparents' friends to America, Australia, and Canada. “What is the future for our generation?” said Katerina Fikari, who feels she is extremely fortunate to work for local government in Lemnos. “If you work just to pay your bills, how can you have dreams for your future?”
If taxes increase, even more young people will leave, warns Mayor Kakali, who has dedicated her year in office to improving education on the island to help keep it as an attractive place for families. Because it is one of the smallest islands, Agios Efstratios has until 2017 before the ascent arrives, so Kakali hopes that the roller coaster of Greek politics means that it can still be saved. However, if not, he plans to travel to Athens to remind the government what the tax increase would cost.
“The truth is that the government does not pay much attention to the islands of the North Aegean,” he said, “so I would take all the children of our school to the doors of parliament, to tell them, ‘There is life on these islands’.”

"What's the latest about something like that? To contemplate the passage of a unique wonder that will soon disappear from the face of the earth? Sudan is the last white rhino in the north of the planet. If you do not mate soon with one of the two female northern white rhinos in Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, there will be no more of your class, male or female, born anywhere. And it seems like a small opportunity, as Sudan is ageing at the age of 42 and parenting efforts have failed so far. Apart from these three animals, there are only two other white rhinos from the north of the world, both in zoos, both females.
It seems like an image of human tenderness that Sudan is lovingly guarded by armed men who remain vigilant and loving to him. But, of course, it's an image of brutality. Even at this last desperate stage in the fate of the northern white rhinoceros, Sudan is under threat from poachers who kill rhinos and cut off their horns to sell them in the Asian medicine market, even though they have cut off their horn to dissuade them.
Sudan does not know how valuable it is. Her eye is a sad black dot on her huge, wrinkled face as she wanders through the reserve with her guards. His head is a wonderful thing. It is a majestic rectangle of strong bone and choriaceous flesh, a head that expresses pure strength. How terrible that such a powerful head can, in fact, be so vulnerable. He descends melancholy under the sinister sky, as if he were burdened by fate. This is the noble head of an old warrior, his armor struck, his appetite for struggle fades away.
Under his immense shoulder that is coming, his legs stand out like squatted columns from the hard tank of his body. The way his forearm emerges from his thick layer of skin reminds us of how long humans have been wondering about the natural spectacle that rhinoceros is. For Sudan it does not look so different from the rhinos that Albrecht Durero portrayed in 1515. They have the same small protruding legs of a majestic body and even lower their heads in the same contemplative way. Dürer was a Renaissance artist imagining an exotic beast from the exotic lands of which Europe began to see more and more. In 1515, a living Indian rhinoceros was sent by the ruler of Gujarat in India to the king of Portugal: in turn, he sent him to the Pope, but, on the way, he died in a shipwreck.
Human beings – we always kill the things we love. We've been doing it since the Ice Age. There are beautiful images of European woolly rhinoceros in caves in France that were painted up to 30,000 years ago. These ancient relatives of Sudan share their heroic volume, powerful power, and paradoxical air of sweetness. A woolly rhino in Chauvet's cave seems agile and young, a creature full of life. But the same people who painted such sensitive portraits of rhinoceros from the Ice Age helped kill them. As the weather turned against the woolly megafauna with the end of the last Ice Age, human spears probably delivered the coup de grace.
Today, immense love is being invested in rhinoceros, yet they are being sacrificed in an increasing number. The northern white rhinoceros is the rarest species of African rhinoceros. There are a much larger number of southern white rhinos and black rhinos. But the demand in some countries for rhino horn as a traditional medicine that is believed to cure everything, from flu to cancer, is fueling a boom in poaching. Since 2007, when only 13 rhinos were killed by poachers in South Africa, the murders have grown horribly. In 2014, 1,215 rhinoceros were slaughtered for their horns in South Africa. 2015 already seems sure to beat that terrible record.
The vulnerable northern white rhinoceros has been hunted almost to extinction – despite all precautions, despite the guards and their weapons – and other varieties of African rhinoceros are under a sustained attack by poachers that is totally out of control. The Javan rhino is also on the verge of extinction. India has successfully protected the Indian rhino after it was almost annihilated by British hunters in colonial times, but here, too, poaching is a threat. What a majestic creature and what a vain human destruction. Haven't we learned anything since the Ice Age?

"The jury selection at the Casey Anthony murder trial continued on Saturday afternoon after the rejection of nine potential jurors, including a man who posted on his Facebook account who had a title, cover and all set for a book on the case.
Lawyers and Chief Justice Belvin Perry Jr. of Orange County High Court had allowed four potential jurors to pass the interrogation at the end of the day, a 22-year-old man who said he was not paying attention to the news and another grandmother of a 2-year-old girl who described herself as firm and just.
Anthony, 25, is charged with murder in the death of his 2-year-old daughter, Caylee, whose body was found in the woods near her family home in 2008. He pleaded not guilty.
He faces six other charges, including aggravated child abuse, aggravated involuntary killing of a child and deception by law enforcement officials.
Jury selection is taking place in Pinellas County Courthouse. The candidates were questioned on Saturday mainly, from their news observation habits to their criminal record.
After questioning and quickly dismissing five jurors on Saturday morning for reasons ranging from financial difficulties to biases, lawyers and the judge began questioning a 22-year-old man who said he wasn't following the news because it's horrible.
Jeff Ashton, Deputy State Attorney, questioned whether the man would be able to handle the gloomy details of the case.
“You have already told us that you live your life avoiding unpleasant things like the news,” Ashton said. Are you absolutely sure you can do this?
Yes, sir, the candidate responded.
Without a doubt in your mind? Ashton asked.
No, sir, the man answered.
When senior defense attorney José Báez asked him if his decision would be influenced if Anthony refused to testify on his own behalf, the candidate said I can definitely understand not wanting to be here.
The line provoked laughter from almost everyone in court, including Anthony.
Anthony's chief defense attorney tried to fire the man for not revealing an entanglement with the law for apparent possession of marijuana, but the judge refused. He was ordered to wait for a possible duty.
Perry later approved the dismissal of a man who posted on his Facebook page what the potential jury said was a joke reference to a book coming shortly after announcing that he had been called to a potential jury in a grand trial.
They already have the title, the cover and everything, Deputy State Attorney Frank George said in reciting one of the posts.
A woman who claimed to have lost a child in a car accident that required extensive police investigation was also fired. He said he considered the accusation that Anthony had lied to the investigators to be proof of guilt by omission.
During the afternoon session, Perry fired a man who said he was irrevocably opposed to the death penalty.
After extensive questioning by lawyers, she told a grandmother that she remembered Caylee's sweet photos, but said she had no preconceived notions of the case to be on guard.
The other two jurors who will compete for the final jury are a 60-year-old woman who doesn't have a computer, and a 43-year-old man who said that although he has occasionally seen newspaper headlines suggesting Anthony is guilty, he said he is able to put that aside.
I have also read that Donald Trump is an alien, and that Elvis is still alive and living in Graceland, the man said.
At the end of Saturday's rare session around 5:30 p.m., the judge said the court would be in recess until 8:30 a.m. on Monday.
By allowing the four candidates on Saturday to move to the next phase, the judge and lawyers increased the group of potential jurors who have not been dismissed for one reason or another to 12, although lawyers still have until the jurors are sworn in to request their dismissal, according to the judge.
Perry said he'd start swearing in jurors once the number of unrejected candidates reaches 15.
Upon entering the Saturday session, eight people were considered viable candidates for the jury.
Twelve jurors and eight alternates will sit on the jury, which will be transferred and kidnapped in Orange County, where the alleged crime occurred and where the trial will take place.
The jury selection moved from Orlando to Clearwater in the midst of intense media coverage of the case, which could make it difficult to select an impartial jury.
Perry said Friday that it is imperative to sit a jury as quickly as possible before more potential jurors are influenced by media coverage.
The longer we wait, the more dangers there will be, he said.
The goal is to have it all finished for the opening arguments on Tuesday in Orlando.
Prosecutors have said they plan to prove Anthony used a substance to kill his daughter. The girl's skeletal remains were found in December 2008 in the woods near Anthony's house after having disappeared for six months.
At Michael Christian's session he contributed to this report.

"It sounds more like mocking the schoolyard than a debate involving the presidential power, negotiating with terrorists, and bringing home a captured American soldier.
Political leaders intensified their rhetoric and put forward new arguments on Tuesday about the secret agreement that won the release of the Army sergeant. Bowe Bergdahl on 31 May in exchange for five Taliban figures detained at Guantánamo Bay.
The controversy concerns a number of volatile issues -- ending the war in Afghanistan, releasing Guantánamo detainees, allegations by members of Bergdahl ' s deserted unit -- and arriving in an election year that has further expanded the seemingly maximized partisan division in Washington.
Exchange costs will include lost lives
House President John Boehner, a prominent Republican voice, told journalists that there was no doubt that there would be costs, lost lives associated with what came out of this, calling the exchange a de facto deal with the Taliban terrorists.
On the Democratic side, President Barack Obama's Senate allies said that the agreement mediated by the Qatar government met too quickly to consult with Congress on an exchange that critics of both parties have labeled as too costly.
All I can tell you is this: -LRB- the government -RRB- knew a day before the transfer was going to take place. They knew an hour earlier where it was going to take place, Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois said, while his fellow Michigan Democrat, Carl Levin, pointed out that the senior leadership of the army fully supported the exchange.
Whether you agree with them or not, their critical importance is for the American people to know that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Vice-President of the Joint Chiefs of Staff strongly recommended this agreement knowing perfectly well that Bergdahl, one, had abandoned his unity and well aware of how bad these Taliban were, Levin said.
The dispute involves both the dynamics of the exchange and the endless argument between the executive and legislative powers about the presidential powers.
Legal requirement or courtesy?
Members of both parties complain that the Obama administration should have told Congress earlier that the exchange was taking place. Some cite the 30-day notice requested by the National Defense Authorization Act, while others say that a simple notice would have sufficed.
It's just a matter of courtesy, whether in law or not, said conservative Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a regular critic of the President. One issue of this importance should have been discussed at least with key leaders in Congress.
Administration officials say the deal met quickly, and the risks for Bergdahl and the military commandos involved in picking him up near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border required keeping the top secret exchange.
This was a secret military mission in which the revelation of the mission could endanger not only the life of Sergeant Bergdahl, but also the lives of the American military who were involved in the mission, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Tuesday. So discretion in this matter was important.
However, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Buck McKeon of California, said that such reasoning to not notify Congress was absurd.
Nothing in the law requires the Secretary of Defense to reveal the physical details of the transfer, said McKeon, a Republican. They are only obliged to notify us in a classified manner that a transfer will take place, and of the conditions established to prevent a terrorist from re-entering the fighting.
Boehner noted that he was informed as soon as six months before another significant and secret military mission, the 2011 raid that killed Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
“I was warned several days before Bin Laden’s mission,” Boehner said. So this idea that they couldn't trust us not to filter things out isn't true.
Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, a West Virginia moderate known for sometimes criticizing the government, said his main concern was the release of five Taliban figures who could return to the battlefield against U.S. forces and interests.
Who was traded for Bergdahl?
Congressman: The agreement gives no guarantee that Taliban figures will be tracked
Under the exchange, the released Taliban detainees were taken to Qatar, where the government says it will keep them under surveillance for at least a year.
But some legislators fear that there will be no guarantees.
How we are sure that Qataris are going to do what they are supposed to do and we are able to prevent the liberated Taliban figures -RRB - from getting involved again, Manchin told journalists.
A memorandum of understanding between the United States and Qatar on the agreement that freed Bergdahl offered no guarantee that the five Taliban commanders exchanged by the captured army sergeant would be tracked, a Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee told CNN.
Representative Adam Schiff reviewed the agreement and said, on the basis of his reading, that former American detainees may disappear even during the first year in Qatar.
Schiff told Jim Sciutto of CNN that the United States has some ability to track them while they are in Qatar, but after the first year, he said, all bets are out.
“We have to wait for them to return to the fight,” Schiff said.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry defended the exchange in an interview with CNN over the weekend, saying that former detainees would be closely watched, not just by officials in Qatar. I wouldn't say who else will be watching, but he said the United States trusts that the conditions of his release will be honored.
National Security Council spokesman Caitlin Hayden said Tuesday that the Obama administration had received assurances from Qatar during the agreement.
We have recognized that some of these people might try to return to activities of concern. The President said so explicitly on her trip last week, she said. But we are confident that we will be able to go after them if, in fact, they are participating in activities that threaten our defences.
Democrats complain of lack of warning
Administration officials gave a classified report to the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday after a similar session on Monday with members of the House.
On Wednesday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel will appear before McKeon's armed service committee to discuss the exchange, which he signed as head of the Pentagon.
He looks forward to explaining why the President's decision to secure Sergeant Bergdahl's release was the right one, and why the process we undertook in doing so was in line with our national interests, Rear Admiral John Kirby, spokesman for the Pentagon, told the journalists on Tuesday.
After the briefing to members of the House, some said they were told that between 80 and 90 administration officials knew about the pending exchange ahead of time, while Congress did not.
Earnest told reporters the figure of 80 to 90 officials discussed in the classified briefing referred to the number with intelligence related to Taliban activities in Qatar. The number of administration officials who knew in advance of Bergdahl's exchange was lower, Earnest said, but refused to provide a specific figure.
Schiff told Erin Burnett OutFront of CNN that White House officials should have told Congressional leaders, even if the law gave them room for manoeuvre.
I think the President had the constitutional authority to make this decision without consulting Congress, Schiff said. But I think it would have been wiser, much wiser, for the administration to have notified, certainly the leadership of Congress in the interest of having good relations.
Polls show division, with more disapproval
More Americans disapprove of approving Bergdahl's release in exchange for five Taliban detainees, according to two new national polls.
Polls also indicate a broad partisan divide, with most Republicans opposing the deal while most Democrats approve.
Bergdahl disappeared on 30 June 2009 in Paktika Province in Afghanistan, where it was deployed with the 1st Battalion, the 501st Infantry Regiment, the 4th Brigade Combat Team, the 25th Infantry Division.
An investigation into the events carried out by the Army in the months following his disappearance concluded that he deliberately and of his own free will abandoned his outpost, according to an official who was informed about the report.
The Army has no definitive conclusion that Bergdahl deserted because that would require knowing his intention, something that Army officers could not learn without talking to the soldier, a U.S. military officer told CNN.
The exchange of prisoners has become a political football, with Republicans once asking the administration to work for Bergdahl's return now saying the cost was too high.
Was Rand Paul's red meat joke too raw?
Slow recovery
Bergdahl continues to improve every day while recovering in a military hospital in Germany, Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steve Warren said Monday, but he has not yet spoken to his family.
The decision to talk to the family is a decision the returnee has to make when he is emotionally in the right place to make the phone call, Warren said.
When ready, Bergdahl will be taken to the San Antonio Military Medical Center in Texas, where he can meet with his parents.
As Bergdahl recovers, the details are slowly emerging on the conditions he endured during five years of captivity.
Citing an American official, The New York Times reported on Sunday that Bergdahl told medical staff that the box he was in for weeks was very black and like a shark cage.
CNN reported Friday that Bergdahl said he was kept in a small box after trying to escape, according to a senior American official, who spoke on condition of not being identified. The official also told CNN that Bergdahl suffers from psychological trauma caused by physical abuse.
Obama:I don't apologize for Bergdahl's exchange

"Can a movie convince you to support torture? Can a film really convince you that fracking -- a process used to drill natural gas -- is a danger to the environment? Can a film really make you see certain minority groups in a negative light?
Some make fun of the idea that movies do more than entertain. You're wrong. Of course, it is unlikely that a single film will change its views on issues of magnitude. But a movie -LRB- or a TV show -RRB- can start your education or bad education on a topic. And for those who already agree with the film's thesis, it can further strengthen their views.
Anyone who doubts the potential influence that films can have on public opinion does not have to look beyond two films that are causing an uproar even before they have been opened nationwide. They have hot button problems that succeed in turning people on from the left and right.
The first, Zero Dark Thirty, deals with the persecution and murder of Osama bin Laden, who presents scenes of torture. The second, Promised Land, stars Matt Damon and explores how the use of fracking to drill natural gas can pose health and environmental hazards.
Zero Dark Thirty critics fear that the public will accept as true the story of the film that torture was effective in obtaining information to locate bin Laden. They are legitimately concerned that the film will make some more receptive or even support the idea of torturing prisoners.
Peter Bergen: Does torture really network bin Laden?
Opposition to the film intensified last week when three high-ranking American senators, John McCain, Carl Levin and Dianne Feinstein, sent a letter to the film's distributor, Sony Pictures, describing the use of torture by the film as grossly inaccurate and misleading. The senators immediately informed Sony Pictures that they have an obligation to declare that the role of torture in the hunt for Osama bin Laden is not based on the facts, but on part of the fictional narrative of the film.
Hostility towards the Promised Land shows us that it is not only politicians who complain about film messages. Large companies, the gas industry, aggressively oppose the claim in the Promised Land that fracking poses environmental and health risks.
How worried is the gas industry?
He has set up a rapid response team to counter the film's publicity by using two Washington-based groups lobbying for oil and gas companies: the Independent Petroleum Association of America and Deep Energy. These groups have examined the appearances of movie stars in interview shows, questioned who are the funders of the film, published parts of the script and mocked the film on social media.
Energy in Deep came to the point of seeing a recent appearance of the film's co-star and co-writer, John Krasinski, on Late Night With David Letterman. A few hours after Krasinski's appearance, Energy in Depth posted a blog on its website pointing out what it perceived as factual errors made by Krasinski about fracking.
Regardless of whether Zero Dark Thirty and the Promised Land intended to promote any message, the people watching them will somehow be educated about torture and fracking, even very subtly.
This is the same reason that minority groups continue to oppose being represented in a negative light in cinema and television. They understand that exact representations matter because studies have shown that biases can be formed based on stereotypes or inaccurate representations. LRB- Being of Italian and Arab descent, I am well aware of this issue as my respective heritages have been represented by a parade of mafias and terrorists. - RRB-
What's Hollywood's role in all this? The same thing that's always been... making money.
In fact, there is no doubt that the studios behind these films are delighted with the controversy that has erupted and the resulting free press. In fact, Sony Pictures' response to the Zero Dark Thirty riot tells you what they really expect us all to do: We encourage people to watch the movie before characterizing it.
So go ahead, enjoy these movies and others like them that are based on actual events or current hot topics. But while you're watching them, keep in mind that you might be getting more than the ticket price. You might also be getting a -LRB- my -RRB- education.

"As Halloween approaches, my 10-year-old daughter gets excited about choosing a scary costume for the trick or deal and the prospect of a bucket full of candy.
I usually accompany her, but this year she has awakened memories of a truly creepy encounter, re-awakened by a recent assignment to CNN.
The British Film Institute is about to release the full 144-minute version of The Shining -- 24 minutes longer than previously seen in Europe. If you are nervous, the idea of submitting to additional minutes than many consider the most terrifying movie ever made could be less than attractive. But true fans of horror lick their lips in advance.
The film, directed by brilliant Stanley Kubrick in 1980, is now considered a master class in cinema, but at that time it was largely received with the scratch of heads and a state of disappointment.
Kubrick adapted the film from the book written by horror novelist Stephen King, and that's where my connection begins.
In 1974 King and his wife stayed at the majestic Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, a small town at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. The hotel was to close for the winter season and the kings were the only guests in the place, echoing the long empty corridors and the silent dance hall. By the time they left room 217 the next morning... Halloween... King had the bones of his chilling story.
Stanley Kubrick treasures on display
I visited Estes Park 34 years later and decided to take my family to the Stanley Hotel.
Although Kubrick's film was shot at Timberline Lodge in Oregon - LRB- outdoors -RRB- and Elstree studios near London -LRB- interiors -RRB- the resemblance is strange.
Our guide told us that the hotel was inhabited by a series of ghosts, sometimes appearing in photographs as balls of energy. The warning was received with a mixture of laughs and eyebrows raised suspiciously.
We were about to shuffle along another carpeted hallway when my wife screamed in surprise: Look at this!
We gathered around your camera to see an image of the ladder where there were three orbs of light -- different sizes, different opacity, different from anything I'd seen before. They had not appeared at first sight and had not appeared on anyone else's camera.
During the rest of the tour our group achieved a lesser degree of celebrity by repeating the feat in several other places within the hotel. There was one on the wooden ceiling of the ballroom and later, when we looked at all the photos, we discovered that another had appeared in the photograph we took from the reception before the meeting or tour guide.
The images were taken in different places, with a very different lighting and of the 200 photographs we took during our vacation did not appear in any other photograph -- nor in any photograph ever taken in that camera before or after. We were entertained and bewildered, but we quickly forgot about them when we returned to London.
This month, covering the story of the extended version of The Shining came my way and while I was investigating it I remembered the photographs.
So when I went to interview executive producer Jan Harlan at his home in the old English city of St. Albans, an hour's drive north of London, I took them with me. He spoke eloquently about Kubrick and his film.
It was a film that shows nothing but ambiguity. And this is what Stanley wanted, he said.
I showed him the pictures. It seemed fun, but since I couldn't offer a plausible explanation. They too remain ambiguous and I am happy that they remain so.
But for some fans of the film, ambiguity leaves a void that must be filled with conspiracy theories. Some claim to have discovered hidden messages about anything from the Holocaust to the plight of Native Americans, and the apparent use of Kubrick from the film to confess that he helped the U.S. government make the Apollo landings.
It's amazing how this movie invited speculation and fantasy into the audience. Which is good, Harlan said. It's a big compliment for Kubrick to get people into orbit about it.
Orbit, huh? Is that another deliberate lead? No, I'm not going that way. I'll take my own photographs instead. And if there's someone out there with a good theory - LRB- conspiracy or some other kind -RRB- that we'd love to hear about from you.

"Alaska Wednesday Senator Lisa Murkowski declared victory over her Republican partner Joe Miller in the last race in the nation's Senate, saying that the result of her candidacy was a miracle.
Against all odds, we as Alaskans together made history, Murkowski said encouraging supporters in Anchorage.
If she prevails in a potential challenge, Murkowski would become the second person to win a handwriting offer for the U.S. Senate.
Murkowski's statement was the climax in the bitter and prolonged battle of the state Senate. It was essentially a triumphant statement to defeat a three-pronged attack: by Miller, the Tea Party Express, and Sarah Palin.
We've said all the time, we'll wait for the votes to be counted, Murkowski's campaign manager, Kevin Sweeney, told CNN.
According to any criteria, this was a clear victory. This was a success, added Sweeney.
Currently, the Alaska Elections Division is counting 100,868 votes for Murkowski versus 90,448 for Miller. According to that account, Murkowski leads by 10.420.
However, 8,153 of Murkowski's votes have been contested by the Miller campaign. If, as Miller would like, all those disputed votes are rejected -- an almost impossible scenario for many electoral and legal observers -- Murkowski would still win the race with unchallenged votes alone.
You can see the numbers don't add up, Sweeney told CNN, referring to Miller's hopes of winning despite the rising tide against him.
The Associated Press has called the race for Murkowski. If the result faces legal challenges, despite a count of pending ballots or a potential Miller count, it would be only the second time a person wins a writing campaign for the Senate. South Carolina's Strom Thurmond won a writing campaign in 1954.
At this point, Miller is not granting anything.
In an interview with Neil Cavuto on Fox News, Miller said he's less optimistic about counting votes. But Miller was emphatic in ensuring the integrity of the vote counting process, claiming that the difference was less than 1%.
He said he could request a recount, that he wants to make sure that some military ballots were mailed, and that the difference between his votes and those of Murkowski can change if a consistent standard is applied to evaluate writing ballots.
The evaluation of the ballots has been controversial. As the Alaska Elections Division counted them, some ballots containing spelling errors or variations of Lisa Murkowski have been credited as votes for her.
That question of evaluating the intention of a voter has enraged Miller's campaign, which has led him to initiate a federal lawsuit in the hope of nullifying the count of miswritten or incongruous votes. Miller's campaign made the Electoral Standards Division extraordinarily ambiguous.
A Miller loss would be a big slap on Sarah Palin and the Tea Party Express. Palin backed Miller for Murkowski for the state Senate primary, and the Tea Party national group followed suit. Murkowski lost elementary school in August... and granted the race. Shortly afterwards, Murkowski launched a writing offer to retain his seat.
Murkowski was first appointed to his post by his father, then-Gov. Frank Murkowski, 2002. Palin defeated him in the 2006 government primary.

"Nigerian aviation authorities suspended Dana Air's operating license on Tuesday as torrential rain hampered recovery efforts after a deadly weekend plane crash.
As soon as we have completed the airline’s recertification, if they are able, their license will be restored, said Sam Adurogboye, spokesman for the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority.
Authorities have recovered the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder, which are expected to assist investigators in determining what caused the Sunday accident that authorities say killed at least 153 people on board the plane and at least 10 people on the ground.
Rescuers have recovered 153 bodies, including those of a woman and the baby she was grabbing. But a downpour and a building on the verge of collapse prevented recovery efforts on Tuesday.
Rescuers said they hoped to resume work on Wednesday morning.
Seven U.S. citizens were on board the flight, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Tuesday. Officials were working to notify the relatives of the dead.
Two sisters from Texas, the Connecticut family perish
Dana Air Flight 0992 crashed into a two-story residential building in a densely populated neighborhood of Lagos, Nigeria's largest city.
The plane pushed the wall of our building, and hit everything, said Kingsley Okeke, who was inside at the time. There was fire everywhere.
The pilot declared an emergency as the plane approached Murtala Muhammed International Airport, and witnesses said it looked like the plane had engine problems, said Oscar Wason, director of operations for Dana Air.
Wason identified the pilot as Peter Waxtan, an American, and the first officer as Mike Mahendra of India.
Waxtan joined Dana Air on March 26. He was captain of Spirit Airlines based in South Florida from 1997 to 2009, the airline said.
It also flew to Falcon Air Express, a charter airline in Miami, reported WPEC, a CNN affiliate.
The Jennifer and Josephine Onita sisters from Missouri City, Texas, were among those who died in the accident. They were back home after attending a wedding, said her sister, Christiana Onita-Olojo.
Also among the dead were six Chinese citizens on the plane, said the Chinese Embassy in Nigeria on Monday.
According to witnesses, the passenger plane appeared to be approaching the vicinity of Lagos airport on high, with its nose tilted upwards, when it crashed 11 miles - LRB- 18 kilometers -RRB- north of the track, hitting the shore tail first, Wason said.
The flight, which originated in the Nigerian capital of Abuja, crashed at 3:43 p.m. in the Iju Ishaga neighbourhood, according to the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority.
iReport: Images of Lakes
The plane was 22 years old and had been purchased from Alaska Airlines. He had been subjected to routine maintenance checks after every 200 hours of flight, and had been inspected three days before the accident, Wason said.
Dana Air says her fleet includes Boeing MD-83 aircraft. The Boeing website says that the model can transport 155 to 172 passengers, cover up to 2,504 nautical miles and has a fuel capacity of 7,000 gallons.
The privately owned and Lagos-based airline began operating in 2008.

"He is the world's largest cocaine producer and a key supplier of heroin to the United States.
According to the CIA, Colombia produces 535 metric tons of cocaine a year, mostly for the U.S. market. The South American country has retained its status as a key cocaine producer despite an ambitious anti-drug agreement launched a decade ago with financial support from the United States.
The agreement is called Plan Colombia.
Since 2000, the plan has cost the United States $7 billion, according to the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington study group that has closely followed the implementation of Plan Colombia.
The money has been used mainly to help Colombia strengthen its police and military. Prior to the implementation of Plan Colombia, 50% of Colombian territory had no governmental security presence.
Marta Lucía Ramírez, former Colombian Minister of Defense and one of the architects of Plan Colombia, says the agreement has helped her country strengthen democracy and government institutions. It has also increased the Colombian government's ability to fight what she calls narcoterrorism.
But Ramirez also says the high demand for drugs in the United States makes it difficult to eradicate home production.
I really don't think the U.S. drug strategy is enough. It's probably a failure. It is -LSB - a policy -RSB - that they have to review, Ramirez says.
Colombia welcomes U.S. Tsar Gil Kerlikowske this week. Kerlikowske, in his role as director of the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy, will make an assessment of the progress of the Colombia plan as part of his trip.
Before his visit, Kerlikowske told the Colombian daily El Tiempo that he sees a commitment from the government of President Juan Manuel Santos, who took office in August.
We will talk about the continuation of the relationship between the two countries, not only in terms of reduction, but also in terms of prevention and demand, Kerlikowske said.
Security experts, including Colombian Aurelio Suárez, say Plan Colombia has improved security, but has not reached its original goal of reducing drug production in the region. In what is known as the balloon effect, the increase in army attacks on drug traffickers in Colombia has displaced coca and opium poppy crops elsewhere.
And the amount of drug production in Andean countries like Bolivia, Peru and Colombia is the same as 10 years ago, says Suárez.
Salud Hernández, a journalist who has traveled extensively in areas where coca is grown, has witnessed the balloon effect. He says drug traffickers have just moved to other countries, but they also move inside Colombia.
There are still drug traffickers -LSB- in Colombia -RSB-. There is still a lot of drug trafficking, and there are still many crops in many regions of the country, Hernández says.
Even more problematic, the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue says that about 90 percent of cocaine sold in the United States still comes from Colombia.
Michael Shifter, president of the organization, says the many critics of Plan Colombia correctly point to the failure of the policy to fulfill the fundamental purpose for which the program was developed: Reduce the availability of drugs, particularly cocaine in American communities, says Shifter.
In Colombia, there is a new impetus to redirect government efforts towards improving the socio-economic conditions of the population as a means of making organized crime and guerrillas associated with drug traffickers less attractive to peasants living in marginalized areas. Colombia's problems go far beyond drug trafficking and security.
About 50 per cent of Colombians live in poverty and 60 per cent do not have regular employment. Now that security has improved, many Colombians, such as security analyst Suárez, say it is time for the Colombian government to address issues such as social inequality and long-term development as a way to curb seemingly endless production of illicit drugs in Colombia.

"The eight-hour rule at the office is over. The most important work of the day is done; what remains can wait until the morning. This is the point at which many workers would think of going to the door.
However, for millions of Japanese employees, the idea of cleaning their desks and being home in time for dinner is enough to invite accusations of disloyalty.
But, after decades of giving companies carte blanche to order every last drop of their labor productivity, a challenge to Japan's entrenched culture of overwork has come from the government, which is considering making a legal requirement for workers to take at least five paid vacation days a year.
Currently, Japanese employees are entitled to an average of 18.5 days of paid leave per year, only two days less than the world average, with a minimum of 10 days, as well as 15 days of one-day national vacation. In fact, according to the Ministry of Labour, few even come close to assuming their total quota, usually using only nine of their average 18.5-day rights. While many British workers consider a two-week summer vacation an inalienable right, workers in Japan have come to see a four-night vacation in Hawaii as the height of self-indulgence.
The bill, which will be discussed at the current parliamentary session, comes after companies started encouraging employees to take a nap at work to improve their performance.
At the end of the decade, the government expects that, if passed, the law will encourage Japanese employees to follow the example of British workers, who use an average of 20 days of paid annual leave, and those of France, who take an average of 25.
Japan's relentless labor culture may have helped turn it into an economic superpower, its corporate soldiers revered in the rest of the world for their commitment to the company, but this has often been the exclusion of everything else.
Japan ' s low birth rate and predictions of a rapid decline in the population are partly attributed to the lack of time for couples to form a family. More employees are getting sick from stress, or worse, succumbing to karoshi, death from overwork.
Despite studies that suggest that longer hours in the office or workshop or on the factory floor do not necessarily make people more productive, today's workers are still nursing a collective hangover from the 1980s bubble years.
About 22% of Japanese work more than 49 hours a week, compared to 16% of American workers and 11% in France and Germany, according to data compiled by the Japanese government. With 35%, South Korean workaholics are even worse.
By spending 14 hours a day at work and giving up many of his paid vacations, Erika Sekiguchi is not even an extreme example. The 36-year-old employee used eight of her 20-day paid vacations in 2014, six of which were on sick leave. “No one else uses their vacation days,” Sekiguchi said.
He faces the dilemma shared by his colleagues in companies across Japan: never take time off to recharge or risk inviting criticism for seeming to leave more committed colleagues in the lurch.
Yuu Wakebe, a health ministry official who oversees the working hours policy, who admits that he has spent 100 hours extra a month, blames the irresistible pressure of matching his colleagues, hour by hour. “It’s a worker’s right to take paid vacations,” Wakebe said. “But working in Japan implies a lot of voluntary spirit.”
This fear of exclusion from work is being blamed for an increase in stress-related diseases, premature death and suicide. According to official data, about 200 people die each year from heart attacks, strokes and other karoshi events caused by the punishment of working hours.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is not known for taking long vacations. However, even he has protested against the unreasonable demands that companies impose on their employees as they struggle to stay afloat in a more complex globalised market. Japan’s working culture, Abe recently said, “falsely beatifies long hours.”",C1
"The DNA extracted from the mill of the wisdom of a European hunter-gatherer has given scientists an unprecedented view of modern humans before the rise of agriculture. The Mesolithic man, who lived in Spain about 7,000 years ago, had an unusual mixture of blue eyes, black or brown hair and dark skin, according to analyses of his genetic composition.
It was probably lactose intolerant and had more difficulty digesting starchy foods than farmers who transformed diets and lifestyles when they took tools in the first agricultural revolution. The invention of agriculture led humans and animals to much closer contact and humans probably evolved stronger immune systems to defend themselves against the infections that animals transmitted. But scientists may have overestimated the impact that agriculture had on the formation of the human immune system, because the hunter-gatherer's DNA tests found that it was already carrying mutations that drive the immune system to tackle several unpleasant insects. Some live in modern Europeans today. “Before starting this work, I had some ideas about what we were going to find,” said Carles Lalueza-Fox, who led the study at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona. “Most of those ideas turned out to be completely wrong.”
The Spanish team began their work after a group of speleologists stumbled upon two skeletons in a deep and complex cave system at the top of the Cantabrian mountains of northwest Spain in 2006. The human remains, which belonged to two men in the early 1930s, had been extremely well preserved by the cool atmosphere of the cave. Carbon dating put the remains in about 7,000 years old, before agriculture had swept Europe from the Middle East. Time was suited to the ancient artifacts found on the site, including perforated reindeer teeth that were hung and hung from people's clothes.
Scientists focused their efforts on better conservation of the two skeletons. After several failed attempts, they were able to reconstruct the entire genome of man from the DNA found at the root of a third molar. This is the first time that researchers have obtained the complete genome of a modern European who lived before the Neolithic revolution.
DNA launched a series of surprises. When Lalueza-Fox looked at the genome, he found that, instead of having clear skin, man had genetic variants that tend to produce much darker skin. “This guy had to be darker than any modern European, but we don’t know how dark,” the scientist said.
Another surprise was that the man had blue eyes. That was unexpected, Lalueza-Fox said, because it was thought that the blue eye mutation had emerged more recently than mutations that cause a lighter color of the skin. The results suggest that the color of blue eyes was the first in Europe, with the transition to lighter skin in progress through mesolytic times.
In addition to the scientific impact, artists may have to rethink their drawings of people. “There are many reconstructions of these people hunting and collecting and they look like modern Europeans with clear skin. You never see a reconstruction of a mesolithic hunter-gatherer with dark skin and blue eye color,” Lalueza-Fox said.
The Spanish team went on to compare the genome of hunter-gatherer with those of modern Europeans from different regions to see how they could be related. They found that ancient DNA corresponded more closely to the genetic composition of people living in northern Europe, in particular Sweden and Finland.
The discovery of mutations that reinforced the immune system against bacteria and viruses suggests that the shift to an agricultural crop in Neolithic times did not drive all the changes in immunity genes that Europeans carry today. At least some of those genetic changes have a history that extends further back. “One thing we don’t know is what kind of pathogens were affecting these people,” Lalueza-Fox said.
Martin Jones, professor of archaeological sciences at Cambridge University, said immunity genes were the most surprising result. “There is certainly a great oversimplified narrative that moving from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to a settled agriculture was initially bad for our health. Several factors contributed, including close coexistence with other humans and animals, the reduction of the food network and the displacement of water supplies. The authors draw attention to the role of pathogens in pre-agricultural life and that is interesting.”

"Tribal fighters took control of one of the major Yemeni cities on Tuesday, a setback for a besieged government whose wounded president is hospitalized in Saudi Arabia.
More than 400 tribal gunmen seized Taiz in southwestern Yemen, witnesses said there.
Government forces have been regrouping in an effort to re-enter the city. Yemen's government has faced international criticism for excessive use of force against anti-regime protesters and the death of anti-government protesters in Taiz.
Are you in Yemen? Share your photos and videos of the scene, but please stay safe.
Meanwhile, President Ali Abdullah Saleh was in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, recovering from burns from more than 40% of his body and a collapsed lung, a U.S. government official reported on the matter.
The fact that he returned to Yemen remained uncertain.
Saleh was wounded on Friday in an attack on his presidential compound. An Arab diplomatic source with knowledge of Saleh's condition said that a shrapnel wound was 7 centimeters - LRB- 2.75 inches -RRB- deep.
Fighting between the government and tribal forces has been raging in the capital of Sanaa, where thousands of anti-government protesters have been pressuring Saleh to renounce power since January. And there have been riots elsewhere.
At least 15 people died in Abyan on Monday night and Tuesday morning in clashes between Islamic militants and security forces, according to a security source in Abyan.
Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has a presence in the southern province of Abyan, a U.S. official said. It is also home to an Islamic militant movement that has targeted government troops in recent days.
Abyan's dead include nine soldiers, four militants and two civilians in Zinjibar and other suburbs of the province, according to the source, who asked not to be appointed because he is not allowed to speak to the media.
There was also violence along the Saudi-Yemeni border, where there has long been concern over the infiltration of militants.
One man trying to cross into Yemen from Saudi Arabia earlier Tuesday fatally shot two security officers and injured another, said the state-run Saudi Press Agency on Tuesday.
The man, described as an infiltrator who tried to cross the metal and sand barriers at the border, shot at the security officers as they approached him, the agency said. Security personnel tracked down the man and killed him in an exchange of fire, he added.
The turmoil in Yemen peaked on Friday, when a mosque in the presidential compound of Saleh was attacked. Yemen's state news agency SABA, citing a source in Saleh's office, reported last week that three guards and a magnet were killed.
Western diplomats said the attack came from a bomb. Yemeni investigations focus on what happened inside the mosque, not on a rocket or mortar attack, diplomats said on Monday. One diplomat said that the attack was not a suicide attack and that the Yemeni investigation was ongoing.
The description of the attack as a bombing differs from what a Yemeni official told CNN last week. The official, who asked not to be identified, said Saleh was in the mosque when two shells were fired during Friday prayers.
The supporters of Sadeq Al-Ahmar, leader of the Hashed tribe and opponent of the Yemeni government, were suspected in the attack.
In response, Yemeni security forces bombed Al-Ahmar's house on Friday, killing 10 people and injuring 35 others, according to Fawzi Al-Jaradi, an official of the Hashed tribal confederation.
After Saleh was taken to Saudi Arabia for treatment, tribal leader and vice president Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, Yemen's interim leader, agreed to a ceasefire, said Abdulqawi Al-Qasi, spokesman for Hashed leader.
Yemen's largest opposition bloc has promised to prevent Saleh from returning.
The Yemeni people will do everything in their power not to allow Saleh to re-enter the country, Joint Meeting spokesman Mohammed Qahtan said on Sunday.
A U.S. government official said on Monday that he could not imagine the Saudis letting Saleh return. He said it was critical that the Saudis put pressure on Saleh to accept an agreement from the Gulf Cooperation Council that would offer him immunity in exchange for withdrawal.
Saudi television Ekhbariya reported on Monday that Saleh had undergone two operations in Saudi Arabia and would return to Yemen after his recovery.
A U.S. official told CNN Monday that the riots hinder U.S. anti-terrorist efforts in Yemen.
We trust the Yemeni government as partners, the official said. The more distracted the government is by political unrest, the more difficult it is for us.
The Yemeni government has had a major impact on the acquisition of information about AQAP, the official said, referring to Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. If that flow of information decreases or stops, it inhibits our ability to collect information.

"The view from the visitor centre at the southern end of the Doñana National Park in southern Spain is surprising, to say the least. This is the dream of an ornithologist: 200,000 hectares of marshes of incomparable importance for the life of birds in Western Europe. Dozens of Britain's most beloved migratory birds, including domestic martins, swallows, cuckoos and gorges, rest here in their annual migrations from Africa. Doñana, a UN World Heritage Site, is also home to some of the rarest birds in Europe, including the Spanish imperial eagle, while its mammalian inhabitants include the highly threatened Iberian lynx.
It is a glorious and vibrant landscape. However, it exists on a knife edge, a point dramatically illustrated in 1998 when almost two billion gallons of highly acidic contaminated water, mixed with waste metals, pour into the park from a dam that had exploded its bank in the Los Frailes mine 45km north. A toxic tsunami of waste spilled over the Guadiamar River and its banks, leaving a thick metal crust on a vast stretch of park. More than 25,000 kilos of dead fish were collected later and nearly 2,000 adult birds, chicks, eggs and nests were killed or destroyed.
It was the worst environmental disaster in Spain and cleaning cost 90 million euros. Suddenly, aware of Doñana's status as the nation's most important natural site, Spain decided to spend another 360 million euros, part of EU money, on landscape restoration, which, in the 1950s and 1960s, had been drained into places to create rice and cotton fields. Some of these agricultural lands are being returned to their original wetland state.
It has been an expensive but encouraging process. However, Doñana’s fate is still pending thanks to the increasing pressures of modern life. Plans to build a pipeline through Doñana have been outlined, while other developers have announced proposals to expand local resorts whose new hotels and golf courses would require water supply that would further erode the local table. The Silto washed from nearby farms is also drowning the canals that cross Doñana.
However, the real coup d'état for conservationists has been the recent decision of the Andalusian government to reopen the Frailes mine that nearly destroyed Doñana in 1998. “This is the most precious bird sanctuary in Europe, both in terms of native species and as a resting place for birds migrating between Africa and Britain and other parts of northwest Europe,” says Laurence Rose of the RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds). “Doñana already faces a large number of threats, but now they want to bring back the very cause of her almost finalist 16 years ago. It is extremely worrying.”
Having spent so much on restoring Doñana to her past glories, it may seem strange that the local government decides to announce that it wants mining companies to bid to rework The Friars. However, a brief review of the state of the local economy provides an explanation. The collapse of Spanish banks in 2008 affected the region catastrophically and unemployment in some parts of Andalusia is now over 30%. The reopening of the mine would provide more than 1,000 valuable jobs.
“Here there are riches, riches that are very necessary for the local inhabitants,” said Vicente Fernández Guerrero, Secretary General of Innovation, Industry and Energy for Andalusia. “We believe that mining is a good way to allow the local population to continue living in the area. This is a mining area. People have been digging metals and minerals here since Roman times, after all.
More to the point, Fernández added, the mining license would stipulate that only modern mining techniques, which avoid the creation of poisonous wet waste, would be allowed. (It has also stipulated that the Canadian company that ran Los Frailes cannot bid for the contract. Sixteen years after the accident, the two parties remained blocked by the claims for compensation.) “The best technology in the world will be used here,” Fernández insisted. “No liquid will be used. Let's insist on it. Our tenderness makes it clear.”
The proposal has some support in the area, but it also has a lot of opposition. A road sign I passed was liberally dotted with obscenities over the UGT workers union, which supports the reopening of the mine. For his part, Carlos Dávila, who works for the Spanish Ornithological Society in Doñana, was also alarmed by the proposal. “This is a very, very bad idea,” he told me. “They say the new mine will be safe, but they said it was safe in 1998 and look what happened. We have the worst ecological disaster in Spain’s history.”
What alarms people like Dávila is the threat that a new mine represents to the intense investment in ecotourism that has been made in Doñana in recent years. An example is the restaurant Dehesa de Abajo, where you can have a drink or a meal surrounded by trees in which storks and black kites nest.
Virtually every visitor was equipped with a telescopic camera and lens or a pair of binoculars. There is a clear tourist trade to make of the life of the birds of Doñana. This should also not be surprising, as this is a truly special place. A vast hemisphere of sky hangs on this completely flat landscape, but certainly not without features. Birds of all shapes and sizes fill the air and sometimes the road. At one point in my visit, a stork stood quietly in front of our car until she felt ready to fly.
“The problem is that Spain does not have the public resources it owned 16 years ago. A repeat of the toxin spill today would have a much, much more harmful impact,” Rose said. This point is backed by Dávila. “After the disaster, Spain woke up to the fact that it had a place of real ecological importance and did a lot to clean it up and protect it,” he added. “Now, we seem to be forgetting that lesson. It’s very depressing.”

"A girl born today in the UK can expect to live almost until the average age of 82, while her brother will live up to 78. They would have a longer life in Andorra (85 and 79, respectively), but are marginally better than in the United States (81 and 76), while if they lived in the Central African Republic, they would barely reach middle age (49 and 44). However, almost all over the world, with the exception of countries such as Lesotho, which have been affected by HIV and violence, life expectancy is lengthening and the best news is that young children are far less likely to die than they were four decades ago. There has been a decline in deaths among under-fives from almost 60 per cent, from 16.4 million in 1970 to 6.8 million in 2010.
That in itself justifies the huge project that the Seattle Institute of Metrics and Health Assessment (IHME) has led over the past five years, involving nearly 500 researchers, to assess the global burden of disease. Knowing how many children die and why the world can concentrate its efforts and resources on keeping them alive. There are many lessons to be drawn from the vast database they have created, which will help global organizations and individual governments to better care for all of us, from a renewed diet approach to the fight against alcohol to sustaining HIV efforts in Africa.
The seven articles published by The Lancet represent a large company and are not without controversy. IHME has been ambitiously radical in some of its methods. In the absence of death records or medical records, they have been willing, for example, to take verbal autopsy tests – deciding the cause of death through an interview with the family. The most striking result has been the malaria figure, published in early 2012. IHME said that 1.2 million die of the disease every year – twice as much as previously thought. The big increase occurs in adult deaths. Malaria is known to kill mostly children under five years of age.
“The way I was taught as a doctor and everyone else is taught that, in malaria areas, one becomes semi-immune as an adult,” said Dr. Christopher Murray, Director of IHME and one of the founders of the Global Burden of Disease project. “Originally we went with the prevailing opinion, but there has been a change as we have become more empirical. African doctors write in hospital records that adults are dying a lot of malaria.” But, he adds, his fever could be something else. The results have led to further studies.
Although Margaret Chan, Director General of the World Health Organization, gave the IHME study a warm official welcome, some staff members are cautious. “We need to be very careful in evaluating the validity [of the figures],” said Colin Mathers, a high-level scientist at the Evidence Cluster for Information and Policy. “We have to wait to be persuaded by the evidence.” His colleague, Dr. Tiers Boerma, Director of the WHO Department of Health Statistics and Informatics, added: “People must understand that some of the numbers are very different and the WHO cannot jump with any academic publication indicating a different number.” However, Mathers said, “the fact that IHME pushed the envelope with some of these analyses is stimulating.” One of the main themes, Murray said, was “an incredibly rapid change in the main causes of death and the pace of that change is much faster than we expected.”
The reduction in fertility and the prolongation of life expectancy have meant an increase in the average age of the world population in a decade, from 26 years to almost 30 years. It has been dramatic in Latin America, for example, where countries like Brazil and Paraguay had a life expectancy of less than 30 in 1970 and almost 64 in 2010. This is an increase of 35 years in the average age of death of more than four decades. “In a place like Brazil, the speed of change is so fast that most institutions are poorly equipped to face it,” Murray said.
The second theme, interwoven with it, is the shift outside Africa from communicable diseases and the common causes of maternal and infant deaths to what are sometimes referred to as “life-style” diseases, such as heart disease, strokes, diabetes and cancer, some of which have important genetic triggers. That change has been particularly marked in Latin America, the Middle East and the south-east and even South Asia, he said.
The third big find was, Murray said, “a surprise for us.” That was the total extent of disability and the cost to people who lived longer but did not have a healthier life. “The main causes of disability are different from those that kill you,” he said. These were mental health problems such as anxiety and depression, musculoskeletal disorders such as arthritis and lumbar pain – of which he complained in all countries of the world – anemia, loss of sight and hearing, and skin diseases. In addition, there was substance abuse. “The rates for these are not going down over time,” he said. “We are not making progress in reducing these conditions.”

"-LRB-CNN -RRB- Spain is officially free of Ebola, declared on Tuesday the World Health Organization, after no new cases were reported since a nursing assistant who contracted the virus there gave negative.
Since then, 42 days have passed -- twice the maximum known incubation period for the virus -- without another case, allowing Spain to be declared Ebola-free.
Spanish authorities had been monitoring 87 people who came into contact with health worker Teresa Romero Ramos, 15 of whom were considered high-risk and quarantined in a hospital in Madrid, WHO said.
Another 145 hospital employees who helped care for Romero during his one-month stay at Carlos III Hospital were also monitored.
The WHO statement praised Spain for the measures taken to identify possible cases and prevent further transmission of the Ebola virus.
Romero contracted the disease while helping to care for an infected missionary who had been brought from West Africa. He died of the disease.

"Helen Keller was an American educator and journalist, who became one of the leading humanitarians in the history of the United States. Born on June 27, 1880 in Tuscumbia, a small town in Alabama, Keller suffered from a childhood illness that left her deaf and blind. The disease Keller suffered is a mystery to this day. His family doctor diagnosed him with ""brain fever,"" but most people speculated that he suffered from scarlet fever or meningitis. Unable to see, or hear, Keller became difficult to handle, as his behavior was described by his family and friends as wild.

Soon Keller and his family developed their own type of sign language that allowed them to communicate in a limited way. Helen's mother sought help for her distressed son, which eventually led to Anne Sullivan, who was a recent graduate of the Perkins Institute for the Blind. The school had succeeded in the past in educating blind students, and Sullivan was one of its star graduates. Once Sullivan and Keller overcame the difficult beginnings, their friendship and association lasted 49 years.
Keller was determined to educate himself and teach himself to communicate. After attending several schools, she became the first deaf and blind person to obtain a university degree. She became well known, and began a lecture tour where she addressed social and political issues, including women's suffrage, and birth control.
In 1920, he helped found the American Civil Liberties Union, which is still active today. He went to Congress to raise awareness of the plight of the blind. Through all his achievements, he fell at a disadvantage with the American public because of his socialist views later in his life. She died asleep a few days before she turned 88, but lives in the American conscience for her tireless work and perseverance.",C1
"A bipartisan group of senators got into the current drama about NFL, Ray Rice and domestic violence.
They sent a letter to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell calling on the football league to institute a true zero-tolerance policy in such cases.
The 16 signatories wrote that they were shocked and disgusted by the video in the elevator that appeared of Ray Rice beating his then fiancé in an elevator, and pointed to the claim that the NFL had possession of the video, which was made public on Monday, when he released his suspension of two original indulgent games.
The current NFL policy sends a terrible message to players, fans and all Americans that even after committing a horrible act of violence, you can be back quickly in the field, Senators wrote.
The NFL recently changed its punishment for domestic violence to a minimum six-game suspension for a first crime and a lifetime ban for a second crime.
If you violently attack a woman, you shouldn't have a second chance at playing football in the NFL, Senators wrote.
Senator Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, recently told CNN that he would not rule out Congress' action to force the NFL's hand on domestic abuse.

"I pulled all my signs out of Ted Cruz before you came in, says Carrie Brownstein, leaning on the arched frame of her Portland dining room door.
ELLE: 21 imaginary TV couples that we wish were real
Brownstein's delivery is completely dead, but anyone who is slightly familiar with the 39-year-old would know that the claim could not be dripping with more sarcasm. After all, along with co-star Fred Armisen, Brownstein, a founding member of the Sleater-Kinney band and, more recently, Wild Flag, has made a second run by portraying a component of the crowd that eats kale, drinks craft beer, wears wood shirts and jewelry in Portlandia.
What's behind Portlandia's comic chemistry?
While the locally filmed program, which returned for a fourth season at IFC in February, has made the native of Washington state somewhat like a hero of his hometown in his adopted city, he hastens to point out that Portland was simply a convenient backdrop for the series. Portlandia is not so much a place as a mood, Brownstein says. It's about people who like to feel special, who like to believe that this certain thing has been custom made just for them, which I'm also guilty of, sometimes.
ELLE: 9 TV actresses that deserve a raise
Given the fans of the show for incredibly nuanced observations of hipster culture -- the municipal recycling guidelines are enough forage for a whole sketch -- it should not be surprising that Brownstein was equally committed to the details when it came to decorating the 1912 bungalow he bought in the modern Grant Park neighborhood 10 years ago after going through extensively.
A different way of thinking about Lena Dunham's nudity in Girls'
Brownstein filled the place with sentimental finds, unique in their type: A weasel taxidermied once owned by Amy Sedaris sits in the fireplace; '50 - coastal landscapes of the era by several local artists fill the walls; and a collection of $ discs that, in the case of Brownstein, is several thousand strong vinyls and meticulously literate by the artist $ testifies that yes, this is a hipster home.

However, the spread is no different than that of Carrie's alter ego in Portlandia. Hard-core fans can recognize Brownstein's real-life street dogs from the now infamous episode of dog parks. Armisen, whom he met in 2003 at a Saturday night party live, is clearly his crime partner in real life, too: The comedian, who rents a house nearby during filming, sends messages to Brownstein in the middle of his ELLE filming to let him know Lou Reed is dead. -LRB- A fellow musician, Armisen is also a frequent guest in Brownstein's basement -- a soundproof practice space fooled with a loungy Chesterfield sofa and no less than five guitars. - RRB-

Of course, inhabiting the blurred line between reality and fiction may have its drawbacks. A particular source of dismay for Brownstein is one of the most famous works of the show -- put a bird in it -- which represents a craftsman couple with a compulsive ability to put a cute bird into virtually everything they do.
Now I go to the stores and see things I want to buy with birds in it, and I can't, because I'm too self-conscious, Brownstein says. The other day, I was in a store and I saw a nice dress with birds in it and I was like, no, I just can't.

"Evangelical leaders are taking a step back from their decades-long struggle against gay marriage, softening their tone and recalibrating their goals.
In recent interviews with about half a dozen prominent evangelicals, no one listed opposition to gay marriage as their top priority. Leaders said they are more focused on protecting religious freedoms, as same-sex marriage becomes legal in a growing number of states.
Is it time to differentiate between religious ceremony and civil ceremony? Jim Daly, the president of Focus on the Family, said in an interview with CNN. The civil ceremony to the Christian community is no different than getting your car registered.
The changing attitude comes as the Supreme Court could take gay marriage as soon as next year. Meanwhile, Republicans, who will take full control of Congress in January, are largely ignoring the issue, as are most potential GOP contenders for the 2016 presidential nomination.
There is a recognition that while the struggle should not give up on defending the definition of marriage of several thousand years old, the courts are likely to undo that very quickly, said Erick Erickson, a conservative expert and editor at RedState.com. Behind the scenes, many evangelical leaders within and outside politics are laying the foundations for religious freedom and protections of conscience.
Implications for the GOP
The new stance could have great implications for Republicans heading for the 2016 presidential election. Evangelicals are an influential bloc of the party and if the community alleviates their opposition to same-sex marriage, that could make it easier for candidates to do the same. The party is under pressure to extend its appeal to young people and minorities, and openness to gay marriage could contribute to that effort.
Hambycast: The Challenge of Rand Paul Campus · Global Voices
Of course, there is still much opposition to same-sex marriage between Republicans. And the issue is a great motivation to raise funds for the party and its allies.
Vincent Harris, a 26-year-old digital strategist who has worked for evangelical favorites like Ted Cruz and Mike Huckabee said social problems, including gay marriage, remain very powerful for the Republican electorate.
` notion of joke '
Brian Brown, president of the National Marriage Organization, refused to speak of an evangelical change as a notion of a joke.
People are still accused of this, Brown said. There has not been enough standing for marriage, especially as a result of what is essentially a constitutional crisis.
Daly, whose daily Focus on the Family reaches more than 2.9 million listeners weekly, is nowhere near supporting same-sex unions and insists that the legalization of gay marriage in the United States is not a fait accompli. But his vision for the evangelical movement focuses on reaching, rather than attacking or rejecting, other segments of society, what he calls taking a kind attitude.
He often mentioned his friends in the gay rights community.
One of those friends is Ted Trimpa, a prominent gay activist and Democratic strategist. The two made an unlikely friendship after Daly contacted Trippa's office about two years ago to join in and fight child trafficking in his native state of Colorado.
They see their bond as an example of where the dialogue is headed, through Trippa they said that people faint when they see us together.
`Common reason '
“With Jim, it is a new day,” Trimpa said. The reality is that gays don't leave and evangelicals don't leave, so we're finding common ground.
Russell Moore, chairman of the Ethics and Religious Freedom Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, is also advocating a more open approach and has asked Christians to love their gay and lesbian neighbors.
If we do not recognize - LRB - the change of culture -RRB-, we have no idea what is going on, Moore said in an interview.
How the Supreme Court’s lack of decision helps gay marriage
Matthew Vines, meanwhile, is an openly gay evangelical who recently published a book trying to discredit biblical interpretations that define homosexuality as a sin. He went to a conference sponsored by Moore's group in October and was surprised that even his strongest critics interacted constructively with him. He said he would have been completely ignored at the convention five years ago.
There is definitely a next division among evangelicals, but it is not yet public, Vines said. During the coming year in particular, people will begin to show their true colors.
Generational division
About 43% of white evangelical millennials support same-sex marriage, according to a 2014 survey by the Public Religion Research Institute, while 7 out of 10 white evangelicals generally oppose same-sex marriage. The generational divide is even more pronounced among the Republican Party: almost two thirds of Republicans under 30 favor same-sex marriage compared to 39% of all Republicans, according to the Pew Research Center survey.
Republican Party leaders are watching these polls closely and in the past two years, four Republican senators have announced their support for same-sex marriage. This year, the GOP presented two openly gay Republican candidates to Congress, although none of them won.
Some, like Margaret Hoover, a Republican strategist and LGBT activist, say the party is changing too slowly and needs to end its opposition to gay marriage.
I believe that the fact that most Republicans do not support same-sex marriage or LGBT freedom is detrimental to reaching and connecting with a new generation of voters, said Hoover, who is also a CNN political commentator.
Hoover leads the American Unity PAC, which spent more than $4 million in the 2014 cycle to support gay marriage and LGBT rights Republican candidates, according to the presentation of the Federal Electoral Commission prior to the group's elections.
The Republican Party could see at least one pro-marital gay presidential candidate in the 2016 elections if Sen. Rob Portman, who has a gay son and supported same-sex marriage in 2013, decides to seek the nomination of the party.
When Mitt Romney was the party candidate, could you have imagined there might be a Republican candidate the next time he's in favor of same-sex marriage? “Even I could not have imagined that,” Hoover said.

"LRB-CNN-RRB- After days of turmoil, the President, the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Yemen have withdrawn, leaving the troubled nation of the Middle East without clear leadership and potentially on the brink of armed conflict.
President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi's resignation came Thursday after the Houthi rebels kidnapped his chief of staff, took control of key government buildings in the capital, Sana'a, and failed to comply with the provisions of a provisional peace agreement that was signed on Wednesday.
The chaos in Yemen is a cause for concern far beyond the country's borders.
For the United States and its allies, the government of Yemen has been a key ally in the fight against al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Yemen-based group linked to attacks such as the recent massacre in the French magazine Charlie Hebdo.
For the moment, uncertainty rules. Beyond that, it yawns the prospect of a political vacuum and a growing sectarian divide that terrorist groups like AQAP could exploit.
Meda Al Rowas, senior analyst at IHS Country Risk, told CNN that unless Hadi is reinstated, the chances of the country avoiding armed conflict are slim.
Our forecast is really a civil war in Yemen because we have a lot of non-state armed groups that are prone to compete for territory and have many competing agendas, he said.
Who is in charge right now really depends on where you are in Yemen, he said.
Houthis -- Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in most of the Sunni country -- have taken control of Sanaa and the northern provinces of Amran and Sadaa.
But there has already been resistance to his attempt to take over the institutions of national government of different groups in Yemen, particularly in the south, where there is a long-standing secessionist movement, and in the oil-rich province of Marib east of Sanaa.
This really creates a situation in which even if the Houthis maintain control over Sanaa, they have little chance of taking control of the whole country, Al Rowas said. We hope to see armed resistance.
Hadi, himself a Southerner, may be able to rescind his resignation and launch an initiative of the Gulf Cooperation Council for a negotiated transition of power.
But that seems unlikely today.
According to the national news agency SABA, the Yemeni Parliament must hold an extraordinary session on Sunday, convened by the Speaker of Parliament Yahya al-Rai.
Analysts suggest that because there is no vice president, the speaker could be next in line of succession, assuming the role of acting president. He is close to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who held onto power until he was forced to abandon him under international pressure two years ago.
Despite their takeover of Sanaa, it is unclear whether the Houthis really want to take over the country.
It is more likely that the group would want Hadi to remain in power as a figure behind whom they could pull the strings, without having to take over the burdensome governance business, Al Rowas said.
Under Wednesday's failed peace agreement, Hadi's government had agreed to rewrite parts of the country's constitution to give the Houthis more political power in exchange for the withdrawal of their militias from the main government institutions and the release of the kidnapped president's deputy.
The government finally obtained parliamentary approval in December, said Sama'a Al-Hamdani, an analyst from Yemen based in the United States. Hadi's resignation seems to be a recognition of the fact that he was not able to lead the country as he wished because of Houthi's inauguration, he said.
Houthis are Shiites from northern Yemen, representing approximately 30 per cent of the population. They have been at war with the central government for the best part of a decade and are also fighting the Sunni AQAP.
In early 2014, they won a series of battles near the Saudi border. And in September, Houthi fighters suddenly descended over Sanaa, where they took over government buildings, the main airport, and some of the power. In the last week, he's been taken to another level.
Although they have been fighting AQAP, they are not friends of the United States. One of the main slogans of this group historically backed by Iran is Death to the United States.
Houthis have more recently forged an alliance with former President Saleh's supporters, Al Rowas said.
This facilitated the expansion of the Houthis to the south, but the alliance is fragile, he said, among other things because Saleh in the past carried out military campaigns against the Houthis.
Al Qaeda's Yemen-affiliated AQAP is perhaps the most internationally known group.
It first emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2002, but thanks to the efforts of Saudi authorities it was a force largely spent in 2005, according to Jane's World Insurgence and Terrorism analysis. It re-emerged, revived, in Yemen in 2009 after the Saudi team merged with an al-Qaeda Yemeni counterpart.
In addition to fighting the Yemeni government and the Houthis, he has been involved in international terrorist attacks, including the failed attempt in 2009 to shoot down a plane over Detroit.
The Muslim Brotherhood is also a powerful group in Yemen, in the form of the Al Islah Party, and is well represented in the transitional government. It abhors the Houthis and has its own militias.
The struggle in Yemen also offers an opening to ISIS, which is willing to overcome Al Qaeda and demonstrate that it is the true defender of faith. In November, ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi called on the Yemeni Sunnis to resist the Houthis.
There are also a number of heavily armed rural tribes that will fight for control of their territories.
While in power, Hadi and Prime Minister Khaled Bahah's government have been trying to fight AQAP on the ground and have also authorized U.S. drone attacks on terrorist targets in the country.
As part of these efforts, the United States has several hundred United States diplomats and military personnel in Yemen. But the U.S. Embassy. He's been on reduced personnel since September.
Houthis have publicly said they are opposed to U.S. drone attacks and U.S. involvement in Yemen.
There are currently no conversations with the Houthis, but there are discussions about whether to talk to them, according to U.S. officials. Staff members said that multiple policy options are being considered, although there is still no consensus on how to proceed.
The safety of U.S. personnel is our top priority in Yemen, State Department spokesman Jen Psaki said. We are constantly assessing the security situation on the ground. We urge all parties to fulfil their public commitments to ensure the security of the diplomatic community, including our staff.
Al-Hamdani, Yemen's analyst, said she saw no immediate need to remove U.S. personnel from Yemen.
I think Yemen is safe at the time, told Wolf Blitzer of CNN. Houthis have been in charge for a while. They have popular committees all over the capital of Sanaa, and they've been running the security program.
However, I mean that Americans might have to start talking to the Houthis. And if the Americans are talking to Iran on the back channels, they have to do the same with the Houthis.
Since Hadi's resignation, there has been a lot of anger against Houthis in some parts of the country, said Al Rowas, the country's risk analyst for IHS.
Although Hadi was unable to unify the country while in power, he said, since the capture of Sanaa by the Houthis, he has become the popular symbol of anti-Houthi sentiment throughout southern and central Yemen.
Many there are asking for his return, he said.
A major anger point for popular anger may be the center of Marib province, he said. There have already been some low-level clashes, and tribes are mobilizing in the area.
There have also been large-scale protests in Aden, the main seaport in the south of the country, where the current chaos plays in the hands of the secessionist movement.

"The dreadful images are clear. There is no doubt that the Syrians suffered a chemical attack last month.
But the sequel videos -- including 13 shown to Congress -- do nothing to show who was responsible.
President Barack Obama says he has high confidence that the regime is to blame, the strongest position without confirmation. But your administration has not released strong evidence.
Secretary of State John Kerry says declassifying more information could jeopardize U.S. sources and intelligence collection methods.
Britain, France and NATO also blame Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for the horror in a suburb of Damascus last month.
However, while Obama participates in a full-cut press to build U.S. support for strikes, some Americans hear echoes of a different basketball analogy: slam sunk.
This is how then CIA director George Tenet described what turned out to be misinformation that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction in the pre-war period 10 years ago.
Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel were senators at the time.
We're especially sensitive, Chuck and I, not to ask any member of Congress to vote on the wrong intelligence. And that's why our intelligence community has cleared and reviewed the evidence, Kerry told Congress.
Some legislators remain skeptical.
The administration asks us to go to war on the basis of a four-page document and a 12-page document and none of the underlying evidence, Representative Alan Grayson, D-Florida, complained on the Saturday of CNN's new day.
They have evidence to show that the regime is probably responsible for the attacks. He has not been directly linked to Assad, in my opinion, Representative Buck McKeon, R-California, told CNN on Sunday about the state of the Union.
Beyond reasonable doubt or not? USA It says that both
White House chief of staff Denis McDonough said intelligence passes a test of common sense.
Now, do we have an image or do we have irrefutable evidence, beyond reasonable doubt? This isn't a court of law. And intelligence doesn't work that way, he told CNN's Union State.
But Kerry said last week, we can tell you beyond any reasonable doubt that our evidence shows that the Assad regime prepared for this attack, gave instructions to prepare for this attack, warned their own forces to wear gas masks.
Kerry says the amount of information that has been declassified is unprecedented.
That information is reduced to summaries of what the evidence is.
` Concrete evidence: Described, not declassified
Physical and concrete evidence shows where the rockets came from, when they were fired, and that none fell into regime-controlled territory, Kerry said.
According to a declassified White House report, satellite detection corroborates that attacks in a regime-controlled area hit neighborhoods where chemical attacks would have occurred. ... The lack of aerial activity or missile launch also leads us to conclude that the regime used rockets in the attack.
The White House published a map, but no satellite images.
The report also cites multiple intelligence streams, without giving details.
"" Interceived communications ""
In the three days leading up to the attack, we collected currents of human intelligence, signals and geospatial that reveal that the activities of the regime we assessed were associated with preparations for a chemical weapons attack, says the U.S. report.
Syrian chemical weapons personnel operated in the Damascus suburb of Adra... near an area the regime uses to mix chemical weapons, including sarin. On 21 August, an element of the Syrian regime prepared for a chemical weapons attack in the Damascus area, including through the use of gas masks.
We have a set of information, including the previous Syrian practice, which leads us to conclude that regime officials were ignoring and directing the attack, the report says. We intercepted communications with a senior official intimately familiar with the offensive which confirmed that chemical weapons were used by the regime on 21 August and referred to United Nations inspectors obtaining evidence.
The intelligence services show that Syrian chemical weapons personnel were ordered to cease operations in the afternoon of 21 August and that the regime intensified artillery shelling in the area, the report says.
The material is still classified.
United States: Opposition Has No Capacity ' · Global Voices
American, British and French intelligence reports agree that the opposition could not have achieved such an attack.
We are sure that none of the opposition has the weapons or the ability to carry out an attack on this scale, particularly from the heart of the regime's territory, Kerry told the legislators.
The White House report points to the well-known stockpiles of chemical agents in Syria. And he says the U.S. is confidently assessing that the Syrian regime has used small-scale chemical weapons against the opposition several times in the past year, even in the suburbs of Damascus. This assessment is based on multiple sources of information, including information on Syrian officials planning and implementing chemical weapons attacks and laboratory analysis of physiological samples obtained from several individuals, which revealed exposure to sarin.
We believe that the opposition has not used chemical weapons.
In May, a United Nations official said there were strong suspicions that the Syrian rebel forces had used sarin gas. But the findings were inconclusive, the UN. The International Independent Investigation Commission for Syria said at that time, and the Syrian opposition coalition condemned any use of chemical weapons. The U.S. State Department He said that at that time he had no evidence to suggest that the rebels had used chemical weapons.
Russia, a Syrian ally, says that its investigation of a March attack in Aleppo, which apparently involved chemical wear, found that the load used was homemade and similar to the projectiles produced by the Bashaar al-Nasr group, part of the opposition Islamic Liberation Front. Sarin was discovered on samples from the scene, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.
Assad’s motive is unclear
Some experts in the region wonder why Al-Assad would have ordered the attack.
Al Assad has no credible motivation to use these weapons at this stage and at this stage of the conflict. He is not losing, writes Ed Husain of the Foreign Relations Council in a CNN opinion column. He pointed out that some suggest that the Al-Nusra Front affiliated with Al Qaeda or other elements of the opposition might have carried out the attack to incite the United States to the conflict.
William Polk, who served the U.S. administrations during the Cuban Missile Crisis and the 1967 Middle East War, writes in The Atlantic, I don't see what Assad could have won with this gas attack.
Analyst: No way in hell USA can support the death toll
Questions about the alleged death toll in last month's attack also raise questions about the solidity of the information that the U.S. is using.
A preliminary assessment found that 1,429 people died in the chemical weapons attack, including at least 426 children, the U.S. report says.
According to Anthony Cordesman, former director of intelligence evaluation at the U.S. Department of Defense, Secretary Kerry seems to have had to use an absurdly exaggerated number.
Now, with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Cordesman writes on the CSIS website, Put simply, there's no way in hell that the U.S. intelligence community will be able to do that. I could have made a credible estimate of this exact one.
The methodology used to reach the figure remains classified.
Rebel leaders have said that more than 1,300 people were killed. The British Joint Intelligence Organization says at least 350 people were killed. A French report says several sources estimated at least 355 deaths, while others estimate 1,500.
The United Nations blames no one.
The United Nations is calling on world leaders not to take action until the results of the United Nations investigation arrive. But it's not clear how soon it can be.
And the mandate of the United Nations team was only to determine whether chemical weapons were used, not by whom.
And Obama says that cat is out of the bag.
Frankly, no one is really arguing that chemical weapons were used, he said.
Therefore, in the absence of a shocking finding that chemical weapons were not used, it is unclear how much effect the UN results will ultimately have.
Meanwhile, the Syrian regime continues to insist that the rebels were behind any chemical attack. But he doesn't offer any proof to back that up.
After it became known on Sunday that al-Assad had conducted an interview with Charlie Rose of CBS and PBS denying any involvement in chemical attacks, Kerry was asked for a response.
The evidence speaks for itself, he said.

"Former hostage Sigifredo López landed in the Colombian city of Palmira to receive a hero on Thursday afternoon, free after nearly seven years of captivity by Marxist rebels in the jungle.
A Brazilian helicopter takes off Thursday from an airport in Palmira, Colombia, to pick up Sigifredo López.
Lopez was found in the helicopter that led him to freedom by his wife and two children, who cried openly and deeply as they embraced him. One son held his father’s head in his hands and spoke fervently to him as he kissed his forehead.
Lopez's mother also hugged him before the released hostage was swallowed up by a mob of relatives of other hostages who had died in captivity.
After hugging the well-wishers for more than 20 minutes, López climbed into a white Red Cross sports utility vehicle and left in a four-vehicle convoy.
The former regional legislator was kidnapped on April 11, 2002 by rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, better known as FARC.
López's release was the sixth unilateral of the rebels in a week, but few of the kidnappings were as dramatic as the one in which López and 11 other legislators were kidnapped.
He's the only one in that group who stays alive.
A video taken by the FARC that day in April 2002 and published at the end of 2006 shows the first minutes of the bold kidnapping that led to his captivity.
The rebels had been training for months. In a FARC camp, they practiced in Colombian army and police uniforms and simulated the regional parliament in Cali with tarpaulins and plastic sticks.
A rebel camera was rolling as the 20-person commando group drove a bus to Cali, Colombia's third largest city. The salsa music was very striking. See FARC's Images of the Dramatic Kidnapping of López and Other Legislators · Global Voices
They pretended to be government soldiers. The motorcycle racers have cleared the way.
Once they arrived at the Parliament building, they faked a bomb alert.
The bus stopped in front of the building, and the video shows people running from the perceived threat.
In the video, one hears an invisible rebel say: For deputies, we have a special vehicle.
Twelve congressmen took their seats, believing the military were shepherding them safely. The minutes passed, and a politician asked where they were headed.
A few minutes later, you can hear the muted response: ladies and gentlemen. We're the FARC.
Back in the mountains, the hostages were piled up aboard a truck. The guerrillas greeted and hugged as they celebrated their bold mission.
In 2003, Lopez and some of the other hostages appeared in a life-proof video. One of his colleagues just wrote, ""How long?"" in his hand and held him to the camera.
Another, Jairo Hoyos, sent a prophetic petition to the President: Mr President. Those who are about to die greet you.
Eleven of the congressmen died in captivity in June 2007. FARC said they were killed in crossfire during a military rescue mission. The Colombian army rejects that claim.
When the bodies were recovered three months later, autopsies showed that most had been shot multiple times in the back.
Lopez was the only survivor. Thursday night, you may be able to tell the rest of the world what happened that day.
The FARC released five other hostages last week. On Tuesday, Alan Jara, former governor of the state Meta de Colombia, arrived at Villavicencio airport, southeast of Bogotá.
Four hostages -- three police officers and one soldier -- were released during the weekend.
Colombian senator Piedad Córdoba has negotiated the releases with the help of the International Committee of the Red Cross and a group called Colombians for Peace. Brazil has also helped by providing the aircraft used in the releases.
The FARC, Colombia's largest and oldest guerrilla group, announced the release on December 21 and appointed Córdoba as coordinator. Some analysts see these releases as a first step towards a possible peace agreement. Others suggest that this is just another sign that the government's military gains combined with a hard right-wing political line are gradually beating the FARC into submission.
Colombia has said that the rebels still have about 700 captives.
The government has recently offered rewards to guerrillas who surrender and release hostages. Last month, two guerrillas fled their camp deep in the jungles of southern Colombia, carrying with them two captives, a 14-year-old boy and a male adult who were abducted in December.
And a July rescue operation released former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt, who had been captive since 2002, along with three U.S. military contractors and 11 Colombian police and military.
The government has said that the FARC military force has been seriously compromised in recent months, but the authorities still accuse it of trafficking large amounts of cocaine to finance its decades-old insurgency.
Security analysts said that the FARC, established in the early 1960s, has between 9,000 and 12,000 armed guerrillas and several thousand sympathizers, mainly in rural areas.
The guerrilla group operates mainly in Colombia, but has carried out extortions, kidnappings and other activities in Venezuela, Panama and Ecuador, analysts say.

"Doctors completed an autopsy of Moammar Gaddafi on Sunday, and the chief pathologist confirmed that the former Libyan leader died of a gunshot wound to the head.
Dr. Othman el-Zentani would not reveal whether the findings revealed whether Gaddafi suffered the wound in crossfire or at close range, a key question that has led the United Nations and international human rights groups to call for an investigation into the last moments of the life of the Libyan fort.
Doctors performed the autopsy at a hospital in Misrata in the presence of prosecution officials, Zentani said. Autopsies were also carried out on the bodies of Gaddafi's son Mutassim and his former defense minister, Abu Baker Yunis.
No foreign or independent official was present, Zentani said.
The autopsy report will go to the Attorney General's office before it is released to the public, he said.
Meanwhile, the three bodies would probably return to a cold storage unit in a Misrata meat market for public viewing, Zentani said.
The long rows of people showed up all weekend to see the bodies.
Gaddafi's family issued a statement on Friday asking the United Nations and Amnesty International to pressure Libya's new leadership to hand over the bodies of its tribe's martyrs so that they can be buried according to Islamic rites, a pro-Gadafi television station reported.
Gaddafi's death on Thursday solidified the power of the Transitional National Council, which marked the liberation of the country on Sunday in the eastern city of Benghazi, where the uprising began.
But uncertainty continued to revolve on Sunday over the death of the Libyan leader, who the Libyan and world powers wanted to capture and prosecute for war crimes.
The leaders of the interim government of Libya have said that Gaddafi died in crossfire after the fighters captured him on Thursday.
But others have questioned that account.
Peter Bouckaert, emergency director of Human Rights Watch, told CNN that the fight was over when Gaddafi was cornered in a drainage ditch. He said the crowds beat Gaddafi in what was a humiliating end for the former dictator.
“When he left the area, he was very alive,” Bouckaert said. There is no reason why he should have been subjected to this kind of popular justice.
An amateur video distributed by Reuters news agency on Sunday showed NTC fighters congratulating a man the fighters say killed Gaddafi. CNN could not independently verify this claim.
The video, allegedly shot near an ambulance carrying Gaddafi's body, shows a jubilant group of fighters pouring water into a man's head.
He's the one who killed him, says a man, pointing.
He killed him in front of me, I swear to God, another man screams.
A lawyer for Gaddafi's son, Saadi, who fled in September to Niger, issued a statement on Sunday saying, Saadi Gaddafi is shocked and outraged by the fierce brutality that accompanied his father and brother's murders.
The contradictory statements issued by the NTC that excuse these barbaric executions and the grotesque abuse of corpses make it clear that no person affiliated with the former regime will receive a fair trial in Libya or receive justice for the crimes committed against him, the statement said.
Mahmoud Jibril, chairman of the NTC executive board, has said that Gaddafi's right arm was wounded when an arms battle broke out between fighters and Gaddafi loyalists while his captors tried to load him in a vehicle. More shots exploded as the vehicle moved away, and Gaddafi was shot in the head, dying moments before arriving at a hospital in Misrata, Jibril said, quoting the city's coroner.
The United Nations human rights office and activist groups such as Amnesty and Human Rights Watch have called for an investigation into Gaddafi's death.
The U.S. supports these requests for research, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told CNN on Sunday about the state of the Union.
As the Libyans move towards the future once again, they must do so with a sense of unity and reconciliation. They have to take responsibility for each other. Those who have no blood on their hands should feel safe and included, regardless of whether or not they supported Gaddafi in the past, he said. So we believe in the rule of law and accountability, and that investigation would contribute to that.
U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville told reporters in Geneva on Friday that there were at least two cell phone videos, one showing - LRB- Gaddafi-RRB - alive and the other showing him dead.
Taken together, these videos are very disturbing, he said.
We believe that an investigation is necessary and that further details are needed to determine whether he was killed in the fighting or after his capture.

"Thursday the U.S. Supreme Court He declined to hear an emergency request for a suspension filed by a Florida deep-water rescue company that wanted to maintain possession of $500 million in gold and silver coins until a final decision was made on who owns them.
Spain has been victorious at all levels in U.S. courts, from Tampa to Atlanta to Washington, said Jim Goold, who defended Spain's claim to treasure. I'm happy and proud of all of us.
Odyssey Marine Exploration had made an emergency appeal to the higher court in an attempt to block the order of a lower court last week to hand over the treasure to Spain.
Judge Clarence Thomas, who has jurisdiction over Florida's applications, denied the motion in Odyssey Marine Exploration Inc. against the Kingdom of Spain without comment.
The company has filed at least one application for suspension with the judges.
Melinda MacConnel, Odyssey's vice president and general advisor, expressed disappointment, but said she recognized that the court rarely grants such motions. How we proceed from here will depend on whether it is a mandate and how it could be a subsequent order, especially given that the courts have determined that they have no jurisdiction in the case, he said in a statement.
Goold said it was unlikely that the Supreme Court would review the case. The Supreme Court accepts 1% or less of such applications and today's decision makes a strong statement about their possibilities, he said.
The dispute dates back to 2007, when Odyssey announced that he had found a 19th-century sunken ship in front of Spain. The company claimed ownership of the coins and said it had transported them to a guarded location in the United States.
Spain filed a lawsuit before a federal court in Tampa, Florida, also claiming the treasure.
Spain says that their warship Our Lady of the Mercedes was carrying the coins. The 34-gun frigate left Peru in 1804 and crossed the Atlantic less than a day's sail from Spain when British ships attacked the Spanish fleet.
In the subsequent Battle of Cape Santa Maria, south of Portugal, the Mercedes was hit in its dust magazine and exploded, according to the presentation of the Spanish government to the Florida court.
In 2009, the Federal Court of Tampa ruled in favor of Spain and the Federal Court of Appeal of Atlanta upheld the ruling last September. Last week, the appeals court denied an Odyssey motion, which Odyssey appealed to the Supreme Court.
The appeals court is expected to send the case back to the Tampa court, which would establish and oversee the procedures for sending the coins to Spain, Goold said last week.
Spain believes that most of the nearly 600,000 coins are currently in Florida, Goold said.
Spanish Minister of Culture José Ignacio Wert told CNN in Madrid on Wednesday that the case was never really about money.
We are not going to use this money for purposes other than the artistic exhibition, but this is something that enriches our material, artistic capital and has to be appreciated as such, Wert said in an interview.
He said coins would be displayed in Spanish museums, and perhaps elsewhere.
Peru, too, has followed the fate of the coins, which came from Latin America when Peru was a Spanish colony.
Formally, they have not claimed anything, but we are fully open to considering the possibility of distributing some part of the treasure also among Latin American museums, Wert said.
The treasure includes fable pieces of eight, some coined in 1803 in Lima, Peru, have said Spanish officials.

"Benjamin Carle is 96.9% made in France, including his underpants and socks. Unfortunately, six Ikea forks, a Chinese guitar and wall painting without sources stopped him to be declared a 100% economic patriot, but no one is perfect.
Carle, 26, proposed, in 2013, to see if it was possible to live alone with French-made products for ten months as part of a television documentary.
The idea was triggered by the call of the Minister of Economic Renewal of Arnaud Montebourg for the public to buy French to save the industrial production sector of the country.
The experiment cost Carle his smartphone, television, refrigerator (all made in China); his glasses (Italian); his briefs (Moroccan); morning coffee (Guatemala) and his beloved music by David Bowie (British).
Fortunately, his long-suffering girlfriend, Anaïs, and his cat, Loon, (both French) stayed with him.
“Politics say all kinds of things and expect us to agree. He wanted to see if it was possible and feasible to do what the minister asked us to do; to hold him accountable for his words,” Carle told The Guardian for a non-French coffee in a Parisian café after finishing his documentary.
It established only three rules: to eat only food produced in France, to eliminate contact with products manufactured abroad and to do so at 1,800 euros per month (above the minimum wage of 1,430 euros to cover the additional costs of living in Paris).
The journalist was surprised to learn at the beginning of the experiment that only 4.5% of the content of his apartment was made nationwide – and that the rest would have to go, including light bulbs (China) and green beans (Kenya).
The moving men left their house almost naked.
He ran out of refrigerator (no one is made in France) or nail cutters, was forced to cool his food on the window shelf and was seen on his toenails with a knife.
His foreign-made clothing, even his underwear, was replaced by more expensive alternatives: French-produced briefs (€26), socks (9€), polo (€75), alpargata sandals (€26), but without jeans as they are not produced in France.
During the experiment, Carle went through supermarket shelves for 100% French-made products, learned to cook seasonal fruits and vegetables grown in France, proudly brushed his teeth with the latest toothbrush made in France by a company in Picardie that employed 29 people and washed their little ones by hand until he found the last French-made washing machine (which, being first opened, does not fit under the kitchen counter).
Dating friends was problematic: there were no American movies, no Belgian beer, no sushi or pizza. Staying home, without a sofa during the first months and without television, meant listening to singer Michel Sardou and reading French novels. French wine was, of course, allowed and French-Canadian singer Céline Dion, but not, according to her advisors, French bands like Daft Punk, who sing in English.
Unable to use his British-made bike or even a French car after discovering that the only affordable models of Peugeot, Renault and Citroën are mostly manufactured abroad, he invested in an orange Mobylette moped that emits leaks.
The last things to do were the computer, replaced by a Qooq, a tablet of recipes that connects – slowly – to the Internet and iPhone, exchanged by an old mobile Sagem.
The documentary shows Carle, who realizes that he is addicted to his iPhone, destroying it with a new French pan from Tefal, while his girlfriend screams: “Are you crazy? Those are new pans!”
Carle tells viewers that his goal is “to save the French economy. After all, I like the Impossible Mission.” He admits that the experiment was partly serious and partly joking. At one point, consult a French-language expert to see if he should use “cool” and other Anglicisms – he was advised to change it to the nearest French equivalent: “chouette”.
Discovering that France does not make refrigerators (apart from wine coolers) or televisions, but is large in airplane seats and windmills, he sighs and says: “Great. Nothing that fits in my apartment.”
At the end of the experiment, Carle takes a bank loan to remodel her house and get dressed. A special “auditor” declares him 96.9% “made in France” and Monteburg visits to give him a medal.
Carle’s conclusion: “It is not entirely possible or even desirable to live 100% made in France, particularly in terms of new technology. But that wasn't the point.
“It wasn’t about French nationalism or patriotism. I was trying to show that we need to reflect on how we consume and make different decisions, and that applies in all countries. If we want to save jobs and industries, wherever we are, we could think of supporting them.
“A T-shirt is more expensive in France, but I can be sure it has been produced by workers who are properly paid and have good working conditions. I can’t be sure of a cheaper shirt produced in Asia or Morocco.”
He added: “It’s hypocrisy to go around blaming capitalists for a country’s economic decline when people could be doing more as consumers.”
Carle says he hopes to continue supporting the French industry and producers, but not 100%. “It’s a full-time job just to find things,” he said.
The first thing he did when the experiment ended was to invite his friends to enjoy “a plate of cheese and listen to David Bowie Aladdin Sane’s album.”
“It was hard not to be able to invite people because there was no place to sit... but I would choose the Bowie on a sofa any day.”",C1
"Recently, investors celebrated the birthday of the current bull market, which turned five years old. On this anniversary, it is worth reflecting on how valuations are being calculated, particularly of technology companies.
On Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Airbnb, a travel rental company, which has failed to disclose information about its revenue or profitability, may be close to a $10 billion valuation. Other startups in the OPI pipeline include a number of unprofitable companies like Box and Square, with rumors of valuations in the billions.
Have multi-million dollar or multi-million dollar ratings become the norm? Is it all about hype and greed these days? What happened to the wisdom of investors like Warren Buffet who evaluated companies based on their fundamental profits and results?
The value of any company is a function of the cash flow that it will generate in the future. A healthy cash flow allows a company to reimburse its shareholders and initial investors who understandably expect their investment to be repaid.
Ordinary investors who trust the hype around a company instead of the company's foundation can make decisions that regret later. Ask anyone who invested in OPI Pets.com about the danger of falling into overvalued companies.
It is true that everyone in the technology industry, from startups founders to venture capitalists, is eager to find and bet on the next big thing. Still, the money you throw around is amazing.
Even a decent business model and growth potential do not justify a multimillion dollar valuation. However, Facebook recently offered an amazing $19 billion to buy WhatsApp, a popular messaging service. Although WhatsApp has been able to make a small profit, this excessive acquisition price is higher than the market limit of 275 companies in the S&P 500.
Some market observers have argued, as Michael Wolf did at CNN.com, that the acquisition of WhatsApp is indicative of a fundamental change, and that the traditional methods of determining the valuation of the old world have been replaced by new global metrics.
For example, Wolf cited the acquisition of WhatsApp by Facebook at $42 per user, which is in line with price acquisitions per user from companies such as YouTube, Tumblr and Instagram. This is a way of looking at things, but it is severely flawed.
The value of a customer is in the income the customer provides, not in its mere existence.
If we look at the price metric per user without evaluating the income per customer, the analysis becomes strangely similar in the late 1990s during the dotcom boom when, for example, the number of eyeballs was a metric used to evaluate technology companies.
Counting balloons or user bases or potential only works in a bull market when market momentum can make bad decisions seems wise. We may remember the NASDAQ peak of 5048.62, during the height of the technological boom, and not when it fell to 1114.11 in 2002 when the technological bubble burst.
But bull markets do not last forever, and it is important to make sure that we are evaluating companies on the basis of their long-term value, regardless of the market cycle.
Of course, not all overvalued companies are bad companies. Twitter, for example, has a considerable user base, solid revenue growth and unquestionably disruptive and innovative technology. It's safe to say that Twitter has a lot of potential. However, the valuation of the company is not justified simply by its fundamental results. Twitter shares are trading almost 45 times its 2013 revenues, and its multiple profits – LRB – a company’s market value expressed in terms of its profits –RRB – is non-existent, as it has not yet established a profitable business model.
Of course, there are some companies, such as Amazon, that do not meet the traditional metrics of financial strength that end up functioning incredibly well in the stock market. But they're the exception, not the rule.
Consider the example of Vonage, one of the hottest IPAs in 2006. Despite losing 97 cents of each dollar in sales, the company had a valuation of 2.6 billion dollars. The basis of the company did not coincide with its assessment. The results speak for themselves, with Vonage shares currently listed at $4.53, below their price of $17.00 IPO.
We are forced to access the most logical and rational valuation methods; otherwise, there is no structure for making investment decisions. For every Amazon, there are several Vonages.
Despite what some market observers say, the old-world method of valuing companies remains the best way to value companies.
I suppose it's true that Christopher Columbus made a great discovery sailing the wrong way around the earth trying to find India. Here is a case in which someone had a great success based on incorrect data and methods. However, investors who bet on technology companies without basic foundations are more likely to look like Ponce de Leon: without maps and desperately looking for the Source of Youth.

"In 2012, photographer Matika Wilbur sold everything in her Seattle apartment and took the road on a cross-country trip.
Your goal? To photograph individuals from each of the 562 federally recognized Native American tribes in the United States and remember their stories.
Since then, the number of federally recognized tribes has increased to 566, and Wilbur is still crossing the country, diving into the native American worlds from Brooklyn to the confines of Alaska for his ongoing photo series, Project 562.
Stereotypes in the media reduce the Indian country to India from Plains in a headdress, said academic Adrienne Keene, a member of the Oklahoma Cherokee Nation whom Wilbur photographed for the series. -LRB-Project 562 -RRB- gives people the opportunity to see diversity in the Indian country and rethink what they think when they think of Native Americans.
A selection of photos from Project 562 is on display at the Museum of Tacoma Art in Washington until October 5, with audio from Wilbur's conversations with his subjects.
Fans of the series say their time couldn't be better. With the United States showing more support for efforts to end the appropriation of Native American images in sports and fashion, they say Project 562 provides positive examples to fill the void.
Having these counternarratives and counter-representations to the negative stereotypes and representations we see in the media every day is really important to help people understand Native Americans contemporary, Keene said.
The project is also building relationships in the Indian country, cultivating ties between Wilbur, the participants, and also connecting them with elite institutions such as the Tacoma Art Museum, Keene said.
What he's doing isn't just photographing. She is building relationships and ties that will last far beyond physical photographs.
Native American Designers Fight Cultural Cartoons · Global Voices
"" The project is for the people ""
Wilbur, whose first name means the messenger, said the images allow Americans to see a diverse representation of a group they rarely see and hear from. Positive models also stand out in the Indian country for the next generation.
The project is for people, not just for the natives, but for everyone, Wilbur said. I believe that there are truths that remain unspeakable and that we can really learn a lot from each other. Let's hope it can inspire the next generation to seek that authenticity.
Questions about American indigenous identity are central to Project 562. Wilbur asks each person 15 questions about their family history, self-determination, sovereignty and the future. Then he asks his subjects how and where they would like to be photographed and take his portrait. Some use traditional Regalia and pose in sites relevant to their tribe's history. Others stand on their porches in t-shirts and jeans, or on the roofs of buildings. Letting them decide is fundamental to the project, Wilbur said.
Participating in Project 562 was an opportunity for Keene to reflect on what it meant for her to be a contemporary Native American.
Wilbur and Keene knew each other before Project 562 through their efforts in a larger movement in the Indian country to change the negative perceptions of Native Americans. Keene, a Harvard postdoctoral researcher at Brown University who focuses on natives' access to higher education, deconstructs the stereotypes of Native Americans on her Native Appropriations blog. Like Keene, Wilbur left India for higher education and spent part of his career in fashion photography before lighting up his camera in indigenous communities in South America and the United States.
Taking American Fashion Beyond Buckskin
The two met at Keene's apartment in downtown Phoenix in January, when Keene was writing his thesis as a predoctoral scholarship at Arizona State University. Keene told Wilbur how her Cherokee ancestors were forced from their ancestral lands in western North Carolina to Oklahoma. They lived in Oklahoma until they were displaced by the construction of a river.
It wasn't until Keene was working on her Harvard dissertation that she visited her ancestral land in North Carolina for the first time. He said it was a powerful experience he'll never forget.
We talked about how to me, being a real Cherokee means I can go to those places and feel a connection to the earth and know that my ancestors stayed there thousands of years ago, he said. This is something that happens through me, and that connection makes me a true Cherokee person, being able to say that with full authority and full knowledge. I hadn't felt it until I was there.
Creating a legacy for native youth
The concept of identity is fluid from person to person and generation to generation, Wilbur said. Some Native Americans lost their language and traditions through assimilation into Native American boarding schools. Others are fighting for federal recognition of their tribes under the broad regulatory criteria of the United States Department of the Interior of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The project has led her to reflect on what it means to be a Native American for future generations.
Code talker Chester Nez and the tragic history of mother tongue
Recently I have come to recognize that it is really about actions, the way we choose to live our lives on a daily basis, is -LRB- what -RRB- will really control the outcome of what happens to our people, Wilbur explained.
He has high hopes for the legacy of Project 562. This year, a second Kickstarter campaign surpassed its $54,000 goal, to raise more than $213,000. She is using the money to continue traveling and plan the next iteration of Project 562 as books, websites, perhaps even educational materials.
“The life we live is for people,” Wilbur said. That's what I was raised for, to find my gift and share it with the community.

"Galina Zaglumyonova was awakened in her apartment in the center of Chelyabinsk by a huge explosion that blew into the windows of the balcony and smashed clay pots containing her few plants. When she jumped out of bed she could see a huge trail of steam hanging in the morning sky and hear the cry of car alarms from down the street. “I didn’t understand what was going on,” Zaglumyonova said. “There was a big explosion and then a series of small explosions. My first thought was that it was a plane crash.
What she had actually witnessed was the agony of death of a ten-ton meteorite that plunged into Earth in a series of fireballs right after dawn. Officials estimate the number of injured at almost 1,200, with more than 40 taken to the hospital, mostly as a result of flying glass broken by the sonic boom created by the descent of the meteorite. No deaths were reported.
The meteorite entered the atmosphere traveling at a speed of at least 33,000 mph and was divided into pieces between 18 and 32 miles above the ground, according to a statement from the Russian Academy of Sciences.
The event caused panic in Chelyabinsk, a city of more than a million people south of Russia’s Ural Mountains, as mobile phone networks were quickly jammed by the volume of calls. The amateur video images of the area, often spattered with the obscene language of frightened observers, showed the pieces of meteorite shining brighter as they approached the moment of impact.
The steam trail was visible for hundreds of miles around, even in neighboring Kazakhstan. Tatyana Bets was working in the reception area of a hospital clinic in downtown when the meteor hit. “First we realized the wind, and then the room was filled with a very bright light and we could see an unspecified cloud of smoke in the sky,” he said. Then, after a few minutes, the explosions came. Subsequently, at least three craters were discovered, according to the Ministry of the Interior, which were being monitored by the military. A crater was more than six metres wide, while another piece of meteorite was reported to have crashed into the thick ice of a nearby lake. Radiation levels at impact sites were normal, according to local military officers.
In Chelyabinsk itself, schools and universities were closed and many other employees told him to go home early. Among the wounded were about 200 children.
A steady flow of slightly injured people, mostly suffering flying glass cuts, reached the clinic where Bets works. He said that a nearby dormitory building for college students was particularly affected and many of the students were brought in the suffering of fear. “There were many girls in shock. Some were very pale and many of them fainted,” he said.
According to early estimates, more than 100,000 square metres of glass had been broken and 3,000 buildings had been affected. The total cost of damage to the city was being valued at over a billion rubles (£20 million).
The meteorite over Chelyabinsk arrived less than a day before the asteroid 2012 The DA14 was expected to make the closest step to Earth (about 17,510 miles) of any registered cosmic body. But experts said the two events were linked by nothing but coincidence.
Rumors and conspiracy theories, however, swirled in the first few hours after the incident. Reports on Russian state television and local media suggest that the meteorite was used by local air defence units and flew at an altitude of more than 15 miles.
The ultra-nationalist leader of Russia's liberal Democratic party, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, said it was not a meteorite but a military action by the United States, echoing much of the speculation expressed in amateur films. “It’s not a meteor shower, it’s a test of new American weapons,” Zhirinovsky said.
Some quickly took advantage of the confusion. Entrepreneurs were offering chunks of meteorite for sale via Internet sites within a few hours of impact.
President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev were briefed on the incident, and Putin convened a meeting with the head of the Ministry of Emergency Situations. “It’s proof that not only are economies vulnerable, but the whole planet,” Medvedev said at an economic forum in Siberia.
Dmitry Rogozin, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister and former NATO ambassador, went to Twitter to call for an international impetus to create an alert system for all “objects of foreign origin.” Neither the United States nor Russia had the ability to tear down such objects, he added.

"Since he was diagnosed with HIV positive, Moses Rey, 48, has had a major problem. It has been able to cope with the stigma of being HIV-positive, widespread in Liberia, and has been able to access antiretroviral drugs provided by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and distributed by the Government of Liberia. But King and his family of six couldn't get the right food to eat. A subsistence farmer would grow vegetables and buy rice.
But meat and fish, expensive and luxury products in Liberian markets, but essential sources of protein, remained difficult to obtain. “Sustainable agriculture allowed us to survive, but we had so many problems,” King said. “We couldn’t get any protein, and we weren’t getting the nutrients we needed to stay.” Pate K Chon, a counselor working with HIV patients in Liberia, provided an unlikely solution. Since she saw a documentary about a farm in Thailand several years earlier, she had thought of establishing a similar project in Liberia, allowing HIV patients to have work and also access to a stable source of protein.
“I saw this movie about fish in a cement pool and thought it was a good idea,” said Chon, herself diagnosed with HIV in 1992. “Many of the people I work with don’t have the means to have a balanced diet of protein and fish is as clean a source of protein – it doesn’t cause health problems as other sources, and it’s something we can cultivate.”
Chon, founder of a faith-based NGO, began building a swimming pool in which to fish. In June 2012, Chon met John Sheehy, a strategic philanthropist and founder of Emerging Business Lab, who raised money for the non-profit farm in northeastern Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, and began learning aquaculture, doing an online course through Cornell University and talking to other fish producers in Africa.
“I raised the money and built the farm, learned the right tank design and water flow system,” Sheehy said. “Much of my knowledge was self-taught, and now I would love to write a manual and share it with others,” he added.
The project has now become the Grow2Feed Liberia Fish Farm, with 12 tanks, which, when fully populated, will each have 5,000 fish, providing up to 200,000 fish a year, serving a community of 1,200 predominantly HIV-positive people, including King and his family.
In addition to fish, tank waste is collected and used to irrigate crops, also providing food and income to the community, consisting of 503 women, 206 men and 346 children.
“Community members live near the farm, and have agreed to be part of the cooperative,” Sheehy said. “Many work on the farm, or tend the crops, and what they receive in return – when the fish are fully grown after 90 days – is fish. They can use these fish to feed and sell on the market so that they get money to buy other basic items.
“The farm gives these people with HIV a way to get back into society, they are now trading and trading with people on the market every week.”
According to the Liberian Demographic Health Survey, 1.5 per cent of Liberia ' s 3.5 million people are HIV-positive, and 60 per cent of these women or girls. Stigma and discrimination continue to surround the disease, leading to about half of all cases in the country not being treated.
Good nutrition is particularly important for people with HIV. Research has shown that they need much higher levels of protein to prevent their health from deteriorating and allow healthy growth. “Nutrition is one of the key things if you are taking antiretroviral drugs,” Chon said. “Drugs are toxic and, if you don’t have food to eat, they can make you very sick. But food in Liberia is very expensive. We buy expensive imported rice, although we should grow it ourselves and fish is hard to pay for most people.”
Sheehy says Grow2Feed is the first cooperative farm in Liberia to operate for the benefit of a HIV-positive community. The project has attracted the interest of the Government of Liberia, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, which has worked with Grow2Feed to provide training, will also support education at the University of Liberia.
Fish farming experts say that the practice has enormous potential in Africa.
“Fisheries farming is absolutely viable in Africa,” said Paul White, owner of the HydroFish farm in Ivory Coast, which produces 3,000 tons of fish each year. “A large part of the fish on the market comes from China and is imported frozen. It is of a quality that could never enter Europe or America. There has been a serious lack of investment and technical expertise in fish production. Everything is coming to the forefront now,” he added.
Some critics are skeptical of farmed fish, citing inbred fish and high levels of toxins. But Sheehy said good practices mitigated these problems. “Many fish from fish farms are endogamic, which does cause problems, but we are using a process with local fish from Liberia, not fish from another region,” Sheehy said. “That means we can continue to use local fish to bring in new offspring. “And we are not using lakes that are cornered, where fish absorb all the toxins in the lake. We can control the environment using tanks, and we test the water and constantly monitor it.”
Sheehy hopes to replicate the model throughout Liberia and the region. “A rice-growing cooperative in Sierra Leone asked us if we could do this on our property so they can feed their workers and we have had an interest in Nigeria and Central America,” Sheehy said. “But we operate 100% non-profit and we will never lose our aspect of social justice.”

"They call it the Richie Rich Club and it's about to get even richer. India's richest will quadruple their net worth between now and 2018, according to a report, with hundreds of thousands of new entrepreneurs and heirs becoming billionaires. The survey, based on interviews with 150 individuals of ultra high net value, comes amid signs of restoring business confidence in the world's greatest democracy.
In recent years there has been little growth, an increase in basic food prices and a weakening of the currency. But the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a landslide victory in May 2014 with the promise of revitalizing the sick economy. Despite the slowdown, there are almost a sixth more Indians valued at more than $3.75 million than in 2013, the report for Kotak Mahindra Bank notes. “Cities are multiplying, the middle class population is growing, opportunities have multiplied and the political environment has improved greatly in recent months,” said Murali Balaraman, co-author.
Among them, the rich in India own assets worth one trillion dollars, representing about one fifth of the country's total wealth. By 2018, that total is likely to reach $4tn, the report says, making it three times the number of billionaires.
Serving the new rich – and old money – is a booming luxury market. “They really want to show or talk about their wealth in a very subtle way and the consumption of luxury goods is a good way to do it,” Balaraman said. Abhay Gupta, CEO of Luxury Connect brand consulting, said the high-end product and experience market “will only get bigger.” “There is a huge aspiring class that admires what the very rich are doing and then copy it,” he said.
Cars are among the most popular items purchased, says the report. While, in 2009, locally made SUVs were shown by the rich, now only foreign cars will turn their heads. Mercedes recorded a 47 per cent increase in sales in India in 2013. BMW has launched a new $200,000 model in Delhi. However, India’s terrible infrastructure restricts demand. Lamborghini’s chief executive, Stephan Winkelmann, admitted, in 2013, that traffic and roads in India “are not as suitable” for the $450,000 sports cars. In India, Lamborghini sells two models: the Gallardo and the Aventador, which has a maximum speed of 217 mph. Winkelmann said Lamborghini's Indian customers were much younger than those in Europe, with a typical buyer at 30. However, the most popular investments remain real estate, mainly within India, and jewelry.
The super rich in India have raised their eyebrows for a long time all over the world with their spectacular expense. Mukesh Ambani, the richest man in the country, has built the world's most valuable home in Mumbai, the commercial capital. The 27-storey tower, with helicopter pads, indoor cinemas and staff of more than 600 people, has an estimated value of $1 billion.
The three-day wedding of Lakshmi Mittal's niece, the UK-based steel tycoon, worth approximately $16 billion, was reported to cost $80 million. Hundreds of guests were transferred to Barcelona for the ceremony and party, which took place in a museum of the city.
But buyers of luxury goods seeking psychological satisfaction of exclusivity are increasingly demanding, says the Kotak Mahindra report. One ordered nine boxes of Japanese whiskey that cost more than $750 a bottle for a wedding reception. The attraction of imported whisky was that no one attending the wedding would find out how to get the same drink in India, the report adds. Another big spender systematically bought identical pairs of Louis Vuitton bags, and then cut half of them to make clothes that matched his accessories. Even the traditional wedding is rapidly evolving. Gifts such as silver dishes, dried fruits or sweets once sent with wedding invitations are being replaced by gifts from the best brands of Western designers. “Today, these are Rolex watches and Louis Vuitton bags,” Gupta says.
Nearly half of the new individuals of ultra high net value live in smaller provincial cities. A high proportion gives substantial amounts to charity, although the report notes that “the growth of philanthropic expenditures in India has not been proportional to the overall growth of individual wealth of ultra high net value”.
Co-author Balaraman says growth in the number of rich people would not give rise to social tensions, as a large income and wealth gap is an “accepted norm” in India. “People know that someone is rich and someone is poor and continues with their lives,” he explains.

"When you imagine climbers climbing Mount Everest, what probably comes to mind are teams of climbers with Sherpa guides leading them to the summit, equipped with oxygen masks, supplies and tents. And in most cases you would be right, as 97% of climbers use oxygen to ascend to the summit of Everest to 8,850 meters above sea level. Thin air at high altitudes makes most people breathless at 3,500 meters, and the vast majority of climbers use oxygen beyond 7,000 meters. A typical climbing group will have between 8 and 15 people, with an almost equal number of guides, and will spend weeks to reach the top after arriving at Base Camp.
But the mountain corridor and ultra-distance Kilian Jornet Burgada ascended to the mountain only in May 2017, without oxygen mask or fixed ropes to climb.
And he did it in 26 hours.
With food poisoning.
And then, five days later, he did it again, this time in just 17 hours.
Born in 1987, Kilian has been training for Everest all his life. And that really means his whole life, as he grew 2,000 meters above sea level in the Pyrenees in the ski resort of Lles de Cerdanya in Catalonia, northeast of Spain. While other children his age were learning to walk, Kilian was on skis. At the age of one and a half years he made a five-hour walk with his mother, completely under his own steam. He left his companions even further behind when he climbed his first mountain and competed in his first cross-country ski race at the age of three. At the age of seven, he had climbed 4,000 and, at ten, made a 42-day crossing of the Pyrenees.
He was 13 years old when he said he started taking it 'seriously' and was trained with the Mountaineering Skiing Technical Center (CTEMC) in Catalonia, entering competitions and working with a coach. At the age of 18, he took over his own ski-mountain and trail-running training, with a schedule that allows only a couple of weeks of rest a year. It does up to 1,140 hours of endurance training per year, in addition to strength training and technical training, as well as specific training in the week before a race. For his record ascent and descent of Matterhorn, he prepared himself climbing the mountain ten times until he knew every detail of it, even where the sun would shine in every part of the day.
Sleeping only seven hours a night, Kilian Jornet seems almost superhuman. His resting heartbeat is extremely low at 33 beats per minute, compared to an athlete's average of 60 per minute or 40 per minute. It also breathes more efficiently than average people, taking more oxygen per breath, and has a much faster recovery time after exercise, as your body quickly breaks down the lactic acid, the acid in the muscles that causes pain after exercise.
All this is thanks to his childhood in the mountains and genetics, but it is his mental strength that distinguishes him. He often faces challenges to see how long he can endure difficult conditions in order to truly understand what his body and mind can cope with. For example, he almost gives himself kidney failure after only drinking 3.5 liters of water in a 100 km run at temperatures around 40 °C.
It would take a book to list all the races and prizes you have won and the mountains you have climbed. And even here, Kilian's achievements surpass the average person as he somehow finds time to record his career on his blog and has written three books, Run or Die, The Invisible Border and Summits of My Life.",C1
"John Travolta, still mourning the death of his teenage son earlier this year, issued a rare public statement urging fans to watch his latest film, The Taking of Pelham 123, which he filmed last year.
John Travolta stars as an ex-prisoner villain in Pelham 123, which opens in theaters on Friday.
“I promise you won’t be disappointed,” Travolta said, playing a deranged former prisoner taking hostages in a subway in New York City.
Travolta did not join co-star Denzel Washington on the promotional tour for the film -- which arrives at theaters on Friday -- because he said his family needed more time to reconcile our loss.
His 16-year-old son Jett was found unconscious on 2 January while on vacation with his family in the Bahamas. The teenager was taken to a hospital, where he was declared dead upon arrival, local police said.
Washington, who plays a subway train dispatcher forced to face Travolta's character, said he spoke to the actor about three weeks ago.
Needless to say, he's struggling, Washington said in an interview last week.
Travolta's statement, which can be read on its official website, said that Washington, director Tony Scott and producers intensified unhesitatingly to help promote this wonderful film, and their selfless efforts have allowed my family additional time to reconcile our loss.
Making the film was a love job, Travolta said.
Tony gave me the freedom to define, and after becoming, the last evil genius, he said. This role as an actor gave me the opportunity to dispense with all moral and ethical limitations, and explore how bad this character could really be. I think you'll like the result.
Much of the film is a dialogue between Washington and Travolta's character through a two-way radio.
Many of the action shots were filmed in underground tunnels in New York City.

TAP FOR INGREDIENTS
Method
Preheat oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7.
Beat the lemongrass against the working surface and remove the hard outer layer. Peel the shallot and ginger, disseminate the chilies, then chop everything with the lemon herb. Add to a large latch and mortar with a good pinch of sea salt and lime leaves (discard the stems) and pound to a paste.
Roast peanuts in a large skillet over medium heat for 3 minutes, or until golden brown, then beat half the pasta. Add the tomato puree and fish sauce, grate finely in the lime zest and squeeze into all the juice, then roll together.
With a sharp knife, note the sea bass skin at intervals of 1 cm in a crosswise way, then rub it all over with the paste, both inside and out.
Get your banana leaf (if used), or rip off a piece of paper to bake five times longer than fish and fold it in half to give it double thickness. Place the fish in the middle, then double to seal the fish snugly inside. Place on a large baking and roasting tray for 25 minutes, or until the meat is succulent and is easily removed from the bone.
To make the rice, sprinkle the vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Dismember in the cremated coconut, then squeeze in the lemon juice, throwing the squeezed lemon halves. Incline the rice and fry for 2 minutes, then pour over 1 cup of boiling water and lower the heat to low. Cover and cook for 12 minutes, then remove from heat and let the steam for another 3 minutes.
For chili pickle, finely chop the chilies and place in a small bowl with sugar, vinegar and a pinch of salt, then mix and set aside.
Now make the salad. Crack the coconut and grate finely 50g of meat in a serving bowl. Cut in half the sugar snaps and handle, finely crush both the cabbages and cucumber, then peel and finely cut the handle and add everything to the bowl. Collect on most grass leaves, squeeze over lemon juice and throw together.
Put the fish on a serving tray. Crush approximately the remaining peanuts in a latch and mortar, then spread over the salad and fish. Drizzle the fish with the soy sauce and spread over the remaining herbs of the salad.
Take the fish, pickled chili, rice and salad to the table and let everyone help themselves.
Tips
You can collect banana leaves from good Asian supermarkets or online. If you use it, keep it briefly on the flame of your gas plate – this will make it flexible, and therefore easier to wrap around your fish, but it will also get the oils going to get the maximum flavor.",C1
"The world shares it and London claims it, but Stratford-upon-Avon intends to spend 2016 celebrating William Shakespeare as his man: the Bard of Avon, born in the market town of Warwickshire in 1564, who died there 400 years ago. Stratford remained very important throughout Shakespeare's life, argues Paul Edmondson, the head of learning and research at Shakespeare Birthplace Trust.
“People have seen Shakespeare as someone who turns his back on Stratford and his family, goes to London to earn his fortune and only dies again,” he said. “But Stratford is where he bought land and property, where he kept his library, where he lived and read and thought. We will spend the year highlighting the importance of Shakespeare, Stratford’s man.” The diarist, antiquarian and gossip of the 7th century John Aubrey, born 11 years after Shakespeare's death, had the penalty of pointing out that the bard had nothing so special. Aubrey, educated at university, unlike Shakespeare, said that he acted “excessively well” and that “his Playes got along well. ” The world has not agreed with Aubrey. The anniversary of the death of Stratford man, the most famous and most represented playwright in the world, will be marked through Britain and the world.
Macbeth will open its doors in Singapore, Romeo and Juliet in Brussels. Shakespeare’s Globe is completing the first world tour in theatre history, in which it has taken Hamlet to almost every country – North Korea continues to resist. In London, they are also creating a 37-screen pop-up cinema, a screen to display each of Shakespeare's works, along the South Bank.
The National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company and virtually all other theater production companies in the country will commemorate the anniversary. The interpretations range from the decidedly traditional to the Brighton-based Complete Spymonkey Deaths, a spin through the 74 deaths – 75 including a crushed fly in Titus
Andronicus – stabbing, poisoning, suffocating and crushing through the works. There will also be hundreds of conferences, recitals, international academic conferences, films, concerts, operas and large exhibitions.
For a famous man in his own life, there is little documentary evidence of Shakespeare's life and times. The works would hardly have survived if their friends and fellow actors had not gathered together all the fragments of each work they could find – erasers, quick scripts, scribbled actors' pieces and 17 works not known in any other version – in the precious First Folio published in 1623, seven years after Shakespeare's death.
Actor Mark Rylance has called it his favorite book in the world and most of the first surviving Folios will be on display, including those belonging to the British and Bodleian libraries, and a recently destroyed copy discovered in France. Some of the most valuable surviving documents will be gathered at an exhibition at Somerset House in London, organized jointly by the National Archives and King’s College in London, including four of its six known firms, which are all slightly different.
The exhibition, By Me, William Shakespeare, will include his will, court documents related to the bold movement when Shakespeare and his fellow actors dismantled a theater on the north side of the Thames and rebuilt it as the Globe at the Bank of the South, and accounts showing the royal treasury payments for Boxing Day performances for James I and Queen Anne.
The outgoing Globe director, Dominic Dromgoole, recently said jokily that Shakespeare was a true Londoner, although he admitted “some spurious assertion” from Stratford-upon-Avon. Stratford, however, will insist that the people did and educated Shakespeare. Your old school room is being restored with a £1.4m Heritage Lottery scholarship and will open as a permanent visitor attraction.
Shakespeare bought the splendid New Place, the second best house in the city, where he died, according to literary legend, on St. George's Day, April 23, the very day of his birth. “You don’t buy a house like New Place and you don’t live there,” said Paul Edmondson. “The general public and many academics have constantly underestimated Stratford’s importance to Shakespeare.”
Edmondson believes that, after Shakespeare bought the house in 1597, all his time of thought was spent there and that the late works, including The Tempest, were at least planned in his library and probably written there. The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust describes New Place as “the jewel in the crown of the 400th anniversary celebrations,” but, in reality, it is rather an open hole where the jewel should be.
Shakespeare's house was demolished 300 years ago and the house that replaced it, probably incorporating part of the original fabric, was flattened in 1759 by an irascible cleric, Francis Gastrell, in a tax row. He had already cut Shakespeare's mulberry tree, under which it is said that the writer sat and worked, because he was irritated by all tourists looking in his garden.
Stratford's urban landscape gap has never been filled, but a five-year archaeology project has been detached from the years and the news that Shakespeare's cuisine had been found in partially surviving wineries went around the world. The whole site is being reproduced for the anniversary, with the foundations marked and the garden restored. Without Stratford, Edmondson said, there would have been no Shakespeare.

"In a constantly evolving beverage market, increasingly crowded, Starbucks is waking up and smelling coffee. The problem is it's not your house mix.
Here's a statistic that surprises people. Despite the long-term success we have enjoyed, we have less than 10 percent of coffee consumption in North America. And less -LSB - than -RSB- 1 percent of international participation, Starbucks president, President and CEO Howard Schultz told CNN Money.
Advertising Age also recently pointed out that even though Starbucks is the world's largest coffee chain with more than 13,000 locations in more than 50 countries, even its most devoted customers buy only three out of 10 cups of coffee they drink from Starbucks.
So who's stealing Starbucksmojo?
Folgers, a division of J.M. Smucker Co., remains the largest producer of retailed coffee in the United States. Its coffee brands include Folgers and Millstone, and also manufactures and distributes Dunkin' Donuts coffee for sale in grocery stores.
Then there's the other American coffee titan, Maxwell House, which is a Kraft Foods brand.
Kraft reported an increase in profits in its first quarter of 2010, linking growth to new advertising and innovation behind existing Kraft brands such as Maxwell House.
This competition is shaking Starbucks to intensify its home-made strategy, in part adding some flavor.
A panel by AC Nielsen recently found that more than 11 percent of American households buy coffee flavored for domestic use, making it a $265 million business in the United States.
Starbucks Corp. will enter the fight in June when Starbucks Natural Fusions, in vanilla, caramel and cinnamon, arrives at grocery stores.
In addition, Starbucks wants to capture a larger share of the U.S. brewed coffee market by relying on its VIA Ready Brew line and Seattle's best coffee brand to increase the number of distribution points. Starbucks acquired its former competitor, Seattle's Best Coffee, seven years ago.
We are in a unique position to reach these channels because of the brand equity and trust we build with customers coming to our stores, Starbucks said in a statement to CNN.
Seattle's Best, in part, will target Starbucks typically fast service rivals and lower-priced McDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts. In a new renaming effort, Starbucks plans to distribute Seattle's Best Brand at Burger King and Subway restaurants nationwide.
McDonald's coffee sales have increased every year since the company first introduced its premium coffee McCafe line in 2006. In April, McDonald's announced its comparable sales in the US. increased by 3.8%, citing drinks, including McCafe's new offers as Frappes, as one of the main contributors to that growth.
Despite all this, Starbucks CEO Schultz said the expanding market could only be an advantage for all its players.
The level of awareness that was created by McDonald'stens of millions of dollars of advertising created more evidence in the market and differentiation.

"Our new international survey in 33 countries shows how wrong the world is about a number of key social realities.
The British believe that 1% of the richest households own 59% of their country’s wealth, while in reality they “only” own 23%. Americans think that 33% of their population are immigrants, when in fact it is only 14%.
Brazilians think the average age in their country is 56, when they are only 31 years old. Russians think that 31% of their politicians are women, when it is only 14%.
In Britain, people think that an extraordinary 43% of young adults aged 25 to 34 still live at home with their parents, instead of the real 14%. In India, the online population thinks that 60 per cent of the country as a whole also have access to the Internet, when in fact only 19 per cent have it.
Why do people around the world so often have no idea of these realities?
It is in part that we simply struggle with basic mathematics and some of us clearly misinterpret the questions or interpret them differently. For example, most countries overestimate how many people do not join a religion: in all 33 countries, 37 per cent do not, according to respondents, but the average is actually only 18 per cent. This will be partly because we will be thinking about how many people practice their religion, rather than what they put on census forms.
People also take mental shortcuts, where they grab to get information easily available, even if it doesn't fit the question. Our enormous overestimation of the rural population in most countries will be affected by the amount of land that makes up rural areas, rather than a careful calculation of the overall unemployment. In Daniel Kahneman’s terms, answers to these kinds of questions are classic examples of “fast” thinking, rather than “slow”.
We are linked to our own perspective and we strive to imagine the variety in our countries, as our Indian show emphasizes by massively overestimating their population's access to the Internet. Our study was conducted mainly through an online survey – and, in developing countries, this will be representative of a richer and more connected group rather than the population as a whole. Somehow, we could have expected this more educated sample to come closer to reality – those with higher education levels tend to be more accurate in these kinds of questions. But what we find, throughout the study, is that people grossly generalize their own situations, forgetting how unrepresentative they are.
We suffer from what social psychologists call “emotional numeration” in estimating realities: this means that we are sending a message about what concerns us as much as trying to get the right answers. The cause and effect run both ways, with our concern leading to our misperceptions as well as our misperceptions creating our concern.
For Britain, this is probably part of the explanation for the enormous overestimation by people of how much the richest are their own, how many young people still live at home, and what proportion of the population are immigrants (the guess is 25%, when in reality it is only 13%, according to official estimates). People are concerned about the concentration of wealth, the housing pressures faced by young people and the levels of immigration, and this is reflected in them by exaggerating the magnitude of the problems.
But, the survey suggests that there are also some problems where people are not as worried as they should be. For example, most countries greatly underestimate the proportion of their population who are overweight or obese. The worst case is Saudi Arabia, where people think only 28% are, when 71% are. The British think it is 44%, when in reality it is almost half of what again – 62% are overweight or obese.
And, in many ways, it is not our misperceptions, but these realities in different countries that are the most interesting and important aspects of the study. Russia's top 1% owns 70% of the nation's wealth, while New Zealand's top 1% owns only 18%. Half of Italians aged 25 to 34 still live with their parents, when in Norway it is only 4%.
The median age in India is 27 years; it is 47 in Japan. Only 10% of politicians are women in Brazil, Hungary and Japan, when 44% are in Sweden.
When reality is so strange and varied, it is no wonder that we are so wrong.

"Britain joined the United States and its allies in the fight against ISIS, but any mission will have a huge price.
The British parliament has approved air strikes in Iraq against the terrorist group that Prime Minister David Cameron has called one of amazing brutality.
Cameron had said that Britain should join international allies in the fight against ISIS, an action that he warned would take not only months, but years.
While the total cost will depend on the intensity and duration of the operation, past experience may give some guidance, said Malcolm Chalmers, research director at the Royal United Services Institute.
Chalmers noted the UK's seven-month stake in Libya until 2011, which cost about $390 million, including missiles and flying hours.
The bill is additional to the standard defense budgets, which include personnel costs and spending on weapons. Last year, the UK defence budget was $60 billion.
Chalmers said he would expect the cost of the ISIS air strikes to be in the stadium, the Libyan operation, assuming we only used air power and the campaign lasted a couple of years.
Cameron said the mission against ISIS could last for years. However, it is led by the United States instead of the operation in Libya, in which European countries took the lead.
` Unique missiles
Cameron, in Friday's debate aimed at convincing parliament to approve air strikes, said Britain has unique assets that no other coalition ally can contribute.
Cameron named the Brimstone precision missile, which he said minimized the risk of civilian casualties, as only Britain could contribute. Missiles can attack convoys, as well as fleeting targets that were previously harder to attack, according to IHS arms analyst Jane Ben Goodlad.
The Brimstone, which travels at supersonic speed, is a 1.8-meter missile weighing just under 50 kg. Advanced radar equipment allows you to steer towards the target, so pilots do not need to maneuver to release it. IHS Jane's estimates that each missile costs about $240,000.
Brimstone missiles are compatible with UK Tornado GR4 aircraft. The planes were used by British troops for relief missions in northern Iraq just over a month ago. Six of them are ready for deployment at the UK RAF base in Cyprus.
Flying the Tornadoes costs about $57,000 an hour, according to information published in a parliamentary debate on Libya in 2011. From the base of Cyprus, the aircraft could arrive in Iraq in just over an hour.
Goodlad said RAF also has Tornado Storm Shadow cruise missiles, which cost $1.3 million each, and Tomahawk cruise missiles launched by submarines. These can be used to target areas that cannot be accessed by aircraft, for example because of defenses, and cost about $1.5 million each.
U.S. forces have been using Tomahawk missiles for air strikes in Syria earlier this week, dropping 47 of them on Monday night.
In total, the United States has carried out 20 strikes in Syria and 198 in Iraq from August 8 to September 23.
Many of these operations were not included in the Pentagon's average daily expenditure of $7.5 million at the end of last month.

"Barack Obama has urged young people to reject pessimism and interact with those who have different beliefs if they want to make changes in the world.
On the last day of his last visit to Britain as president of the United States, Obama told 500 youth leaders at a public meeting in London: “I’m here to ask them to reject the idea that there are forces we cannot control. As JFK said, our problems are man-made and can be solved by man.
“You’ve never had better tools to make a difference,” he said at level A and to UK-US exchange students in the Q & A session. “Reject pessimism, cynicism and know that progress is possible. Progress is not inevitable; it requires struggle, discipline and faith.”
But Obama recognized the challenges that young people face: “I don’t mean that their generation has had it easy, in a time of impressive changes, since September 11, 7/7...and during an era of information and Twitter where there is a steady flow of bad news.”
The audience applauded when the president was introduced and continued to talk about his policies, including health and education.
He urged the audience to interact with people with different political beliefs: “Find people who disagree with you and it will also help you commit.”
Obama also said: “You should feel that social attitudes are changing. That doesn’t mean it’s fast enough, but you have to keep pushing and it’s partly because of the brave acts of young people like you.”
When asked about his presidential legacy, Obama said he was proud of the health reforms, which received great applause from the audience, and said of America’s response to the 2008 financial crisis: “Save the world from a great depression – that was pretty good.”
He also listed diplomatic agreements with Iran and the response to the Ebola crisis as highlights of his presidency. “I am proud; I believe I have been faithful to myself during this process.”
But he added: “Do not give up and succumb to cynics if, after five years, poverty has not been eradicated... It’s okay. Dr. Martin Luther King says that the arc of the moral universe is long but leans toward justice.”
Asked about the controversial Transatlantic Trade and Investment Association (TTIP), he said: “The response to globalization is not to lift the drawbridge and close it,” although it was crucial to pay attention to workers’ rights.
Before Obama arrived, Tanya Williams, a community engagement officer, told the Guardian: “I love Michelle, but I like Obama, and it’s exciting to have the opportunity to listen to someone who has changed so much and galvanized so many people who didn’t vote before.”
Oliver Sidorczuk, 26, said: “Everyone is very excited to hear what he has to say. I'm going to ask him about election rights and try to ask him if he would join our campaign to ask David Cameron to register automatically.""
Obama ended the session by taking a question from a young Sikh from London, who asked about the issue of racial profiling at airports and being confused with a Muslim.
Obama said that while there were people with “mad ideology,” pluralism was important. “I visited a mosque a few months ago and said that our biggest allies are American Muslims who are more integrated and economically well,” he said.
Furqan Naeem, an activist from Manchester, said: “I recently visited the United States through the American embassy on the community leaders program and saw first hand a really important job the president did in celebrating America’s diversity and bringing communities together.”
Kenny Imafidon, director general of the ClearView Research youth organization, later said: “It was a great opportunity and what will accompany me is what he said about meeting people who have a different policy than yours and having to make commitments. Besides, what he said about being a good leader and finding great talent.”
Later, Obama met Jeremy Corbyn, who said they had an “excellent” 90-minute discussion.
The Labour leader said he spoke about “the challenges facing post-industrial societies and the power of global corporations, and the growing use of technology around the world and the effect it has.”
When asked if they were talking about the President's intervention in the debate on Britain's accession to the EU, Corbyn said it was briefly discussed.
After the meeting, Obama joined Cameron to play golf at Grove in Chandlers Cross, Hertfordshire. Obama ended the day at dinner with U.S. Prime Minister and Ambassador Matthew Barzun at the ambassador's residence before traveling to Germany.",C1
"When two islanders saw a small fiberglass boat dragged into a remote Pacific atoll, they decided to take a closer look. What they found inside was an adventure and survival story unlikely to rival the book and the film Life of Pi: a gritty man with long hair and beard, who claimed to have been drifting for 16 months after leaving Mexico, more than 12,500 km away.
The man, dressed only in a pair of torn underpants, told his rescuers that he had been drifting in the 7.3-meter fiberglass boat, whose engines were missing his propellers, since he left Mexico for El Salvador in September 2012. A companion had died at sea several months earlier, he said.
“His condition is not good, but he is improving,” said Ola Fjeldstad, a Norwegian student of anthropology who investigates the isolated Ebon Atoll, part of the Marshall Islands archipelago. The man had said his name was José Ivan and had indicated that he survived by capturing turtles and birds with bare hands, but, as he spoke only Spanish, more details were scarce. There was no fishing equipment on the boat, but a turtle was inside when it left. “The boat is really scratched and seems to have been in the water for a long time,” Fjeldstad told reporters.
According to the researcher, the islanders who found the man took him to the main island on the atoll, which is so remote that he has only one telephone line and no internet, to meet with the mayor, Ione de Brum, who contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Majuro, the capital of the Marshall Islands. Ministry officials said they were waiting for more details and expected the man to be taken to the capital.
The only government airline aircraft that can land in Ebon is currently under maintenance and is not expected to return to service for several days. Officers are considering sending a boat to pick up the castaway. “He’s staying at the local council house and a family is feeding him,” said Fjeldstad, who added that the man had a basic medical checkup and found that he had low blood pressure, but did not seem to have any life-threatening conditions and was able to walk with the help of men on the island. “We’ve been giving him a lot of water and he’s gaining strength.”
Fraser Christian, who teaches maritime survival courses at his Coastal Survival School in Dorset, said that man's story, if true, would be remarkable, but far from unique. It was entirely possible to catch turtles or small fish by hand, he said, as “they are curious and will approach a small boat to take refuge under it.” Christian advises customers who are forced to eat turtles to start with their eyes – “many fluids” – and then move into blood.
The main problems that man would have faced were exposure and dehydration. “The basic rule is: there is no water, there is no food. You need water to digest proteins. If you don’t have fresh water and it doesn’t rain for a few days, so you can’t collect rainwater, you’ve basically had it.” Individual physiology also plays a role, he said, with some people more suited to survive than others. “Mind is key and that often depends on the situation of people in life and how they are used to deal mentally with difficulties.”
Survival stories in the vast Pacific Ocean are not uncommon. In 2006, three Mexicans came out to international headlines when they were discovered drifting, also on a small fiberglass boat near the Marshall Islands. They claimed to have survived for nine months at sea on a diet of rainwater, raw fish, and seabirds, and their hope was kept alive by reading the Bible. But Cliff Downing, who teaches marine survival to sailors, said he was skeptical about the latest story. “It doesn’t sound right to me. There are 1,001 dangers that would make your survival so long very unlikely. One would like to know much more.”
More shipwrecked: Poon Lim, a Chinese sailor from a British ship sunk by a German submarine in 1942, survived 133 days on a wooden raft floating in the South Atlantic before being rescued by Brazilian fishermen. In 1971, experienced Scottish sailor Dougal Robertson and his family sailed to the Galapagos Islands from Panama when their boat was sunk by killer whales. They survived 38 days in a lifeboat before being rescued by a passing trawler.
In 2006, three Mexican fishermen were discovered drifting on a small boat near the Marshall Islands, nine months after embarking on a shark fishing expedition. Apparently they survived on a diet of rainwater, raw fish, and seabirds. Before being rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard, the men remained alive eating tuna. A Panamanian fisherman sued Princess Cruises in 2012 after one of his ships ignored his cry for help and two comrades who were stranded on his broken ship. He survived 28 days adrift, but his friends died of thirst.

"Egypt has agreed to allow two Iranian warships to cross the Suez Canal in a movement that places the country's new military regime in a thorny position with its Israeli neighbour.
The post-Hosni Mubarak interim government gave the green light to Iranian warships on Friday, state media reported. It is expected that they will be the first Iranian warships to sail through Suez since the 1979 revolution of the Islamic Republic.
The canal is an internal body of water, and as such Egypt has sovereignty over it. But Egypt is also bound by the 1978 Camp David Agreements, which guarantee the right of free passage by ships belonging to Israel and all other nations on the basis of the 1888 Constantinople Convention. Before that, Egypt did not allow Israeli ships to navigate the canal.
Last week, Egypt's new military government said it would honor all its international treaties. That would include Camp David.
This is uncomfortable, at a minimum, said David Schenker, director of the Arab Policy Programme at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
Schenker said the Iranians had asked for a frigate -- the Alvand -- and a military supply vessel -- the Kharg -- to cross into the Mediterranean. They are both armed with missiles, he said, and added that their passage would create more uncertainty in the region.
It's destabilizing. Tension increases, particularly at this time of transition in Egypt, Schenker said. This is typical of Syrian-Iranian opportunism.
Egypt's decision, analysts said, could show the direction military caregivers intend to take in the most populous nation in the Arab world.
It raises an unwanted political issue that needs to be resolved, said the Commander. James Kraska of the United States of America Naval War School in Rhode Island.
Iran previously said that the flotilla was on a one-year intelligence and training mission to prepare cadets to defend Iranian cargo ships and oil tankers from the threat of attack by Somali pirates, according to the semi-official Fars Agency.
Asked about Iran's claim that ships go to Syria for training, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Friday, my initial answer to that would be that we are highly skeptical of that.
He asked if he was concerned about travel plans, he said, “It’s not really about ships. It is what ships carry, what their destination is, what is the cargo on board, where it goes, to whom, for what benefit. We have, you know, continuous concerns.
Those concerns were shared by the White House, where Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters aboard Air Force One, We are monitoring that, obviously, but we would also say that Iran does not have a great record of responsible behavior in the region, which is always a concern for us.
Israel's Foreign Minister, Avigdor Lieberman, said Israel's allies should pay close attention to the situation.
We hope that the international community will act quickly and decisively against Iranian provocations, aimed at deteriorating the situation in the area, and put the Iranians in their place, he said.
The Israeli Ministry of Defense said it was monitoring the movement of Iranian ships and alerted its allies.
The Suez Canal is a key channel for international trade. It connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea, allowing ships to sail between Europe and Asia without having to cross Africa. Millions of barrels of oil move through Suez every day on their way to Europe and North America.

"During the height of the 2009 financial crisis, when there was a real and present danger that banks would take over due to lack of liquidity, then British Prime Minister Gordon Brown altered geopolitical architecture.
Brown moved with a sense of urgency to formalize the Group of 20 nations.
The strategy was good. I wanted to include the countries that accounted for 80% of GDP under the same umbrella, to narrow the gap between the developed and developing worlds and, more importantly, to take advantage of the $4 trillion of surplus funds that still exist in the BRICS economies.
In the context of a financial crisis, the strategy worked. Four years later, however, geopolitics is surpassing the economy. The G20 has become a hard-to-manage group of countries with different priorities, and without Washington's political backing.
According to Brown, whom I interviewed earlier this year, the United States should be more alert to the possibilities of international cooperation in both trade and growth agreements.
A global trade agreement, the so-called pivot to Asia, and even serious concerns about capital flight from emerging markets and their currencies will be overshadowed in this G20. Syria will be the top of the agenda when leaders gather at Russia's western outpost in St. Petersburg.
The focus is on the tensions between host Vladimir Putin and his American counterpart Barack Obama. His just verbal could further divide the G20, the strategists suggest. As a general rule, the BRICS are not in favour of Washington and Paris calling for military intervention.
The business has taken a back seat and must move to the front seat, Mustafa Abdel-Wadood, chairman of the executive committee of the private capital group Abraaj told me. Politics is at the top of the agenda.
The business agenda is led by the close reaction to the panic of a planned reduction in bond purchases by the United States Federal Reserve. Since Federal Reserve President Ben Bernanke spoke of that strategy change in May, money has been flooding emerging markets.
Prior to this week's summit, high-ranking Chinese finance officials stepped out of their way to suggest, during a press conference in Beijing, that the Federal Reserve should be more cautious with its approach.
Zhu Guangyao, China's Deputy Minister of Finance, welcomed the signs of America's recovery, but said Washington should consider the effect of spreading its monetary policy, especially the opportunity and pace of its exit from ultra-luggish monetary policy.
The end of easy money or loose monetary policy in the United States is exposing the cracks in emerging markets, which rode a powerful wave of commodity-driven growth for a decade.
Without that demand for exports of grains, gold, palm oil, rubber, minerals and even manufactured goods, economies such as Brazil, India, South Africa, Turkey and Indonesia have seen their current account deficits plummet and their currencies plummet.
India's rupee has fallen by more than 20% this year, most of that loss just in the last quarter, as the country registered the worst growth in four years. Brazil and Indonesia have seen their currencies fall by 10%, forcing central banks to use monetary reserves and, in some cases, interest rate increases to stop the bleeding.
The trend is for investors to make comparisons with the Asian financial crisis 1998/1999, when these economies had large current account deficits and a mountain of foreign currency government debt.
Most of Asia learned a lesson, Marios Maratheftis, global director of macro research at Standard Chartered Bank, told me. Most emerging market debt is now issued in local currencies.
Maratheftis said the sudden stoppage of capital flows to emerging markets will create problems for those with rising current account deficits, but this should not become a crisis as long as there is greater policy coordination.
He has no great hope for discussions in St. Petersburg. They talk globally when they meet, he said of the G20. But act local when you go home.

"Many of the major supermarket chains have been set on fire with accusations of various unethical acts over the past decade. They have wasted tons of food, mispaid their suppliers and contributed to the excess of plastic waste in their packaging, which has had an impact on our environment.
But supermarkets and shopkeepers are starting to sit down and take note. In response to a growing consumer reaction to the huge amounts of plastic waste generated by plastic packaging, some of the UK's largest supermarkets have signed a pact that promises to transform packaging and cut plastic waste. In a commitment to reuse, recycle or compost all plastic waste by 2025, supermarkets are beginning to assume some responsibility for the role they play in contributing to the damage to our environment, with a major supermarket announcing their plan to remove all plastic packaging in their own branded products by 2023.
In response to criticism of food waste, some supermarkets are donating part of their food surplus. However, charities estimate that they are only accessing 2% of the supermarket's total food surplus, so this hardly seems to be solving the problem. Some say supermarkets are just not doing enough. Most supermarkets operate under a veil of secrecy when asked for exact food waste figures, and without more transparency it is difficult to find a systematic approach to avoiding waste and redistributing food surpluses.
Some smaller companies are taking things into their own hands and offering consumers a more eco-friendly and environmentally friendly option. Shops such as Berlin's Original Unverpakt and London's bulk market are free plastic stores that have opened in recent years, encouraging customers to use their own compostable containers or bags. Farmdrop online eliminates the need for department stores and the risk of a huge surplus of food by delivering fresh produce from local farmers to their customers daily through electric cars, offering farmers most of the retail price.
There is no doubt that we still have a long way to go to reduce food and plastic waste. But perhaps large supermarkets could draw inspiration from these small traders and gradually move towards a more sustainable future for all of us.",C1
"Music subscription services, including Spotify and Deezer, have broken the $1 billion sales barrier around the world, as a growing number of fans choose to pay for online music.
Transmission and subscription revenues increased by more than 50% in 2013 to $1.1 billion, helping total sales of recorded music in Europe grow for the first time in 12 years, according to figures released in March 2014.
It is estimated that there are now 450 music rental services around the world, and although many people still listen for free, the desire for more options is persuading more music lovers to separate from their money. Over a three-year period, the number of subscribers paid increased from 8 million to 28 million, according to the 2014 International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) digital music report.
Easily accessible from smartphones and tablets, subscription services are popular with people looking to try new music without committing to buying a download or CD. Consumers say they are attracted to a cheap, easy-to-use and legal alternative to pirate downloads. “It is now clear that music transmission and subscription is a traditional model for our business,” said IFPI Executive Director Frances Moore. There are signs that, in Britain and America, streaming can soon generate more revenue for the music industry than downloads from online stores like Apple's iTunes. Subscription services now account for one third of all digital sales worldwide, with downloads constituting the balance, but IFPI data show that the two formats are growing at different speeds.
In the United States, the percentage of people claiming to use subscription and streaming increased from 19 per cent in 2012 to 23 per cent, while the percentage of people downloaded decreased from 28 per cent to 27 per cent. In Britain, downloaders remained static, by exactly one third, while subscribers grew from 19% to 22%. In Sweden, France and Italy, streaming is already more popular than downloading.
Digital formats now account for 39% of all music sales, or nearly £5.9 billion of £15 billion, and while sales of CDs and vinyls declined sharply in 2013, they continue to contribute just over half of the industry's revenue. A recent music sales accident in Japan, which accounts for one fifth of the sales of the music industry and where physical formats remained popular for longer than elsewhere, meant that sales in all formats fell globally by 3.9%.
However, vinyl continued to return in some markets. Sales increased by 32 per cent in the Americas and by 101 per cent in the United Kingdom in 2013.
IFPI also said that One Direction was the best-selling artist of 2013, with physical and digital sales of 4m for its album Midnight Memories. Katy Perry's Prisma was the best-selling album by a female artist, in sixth place behind Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Bruno Mars and Daft Punk.
Consumer technology companies have been competing to join the trend of music transmission, with Apple launching iTunes Radio and Google promoting its Play Store, with smaller players like Beats Music, created by the team behind the Beats headset brand, also joining the fight.

"In higher education, science subjects are usually dominated by male students. This has a negative impact on the world of work, as fewer women enter the science, technology and engineering sectors. This essay will explore the reasons for the lack of gender diversity in science and suggest ways to create equal opportunities in this area.
The most likely reason for the imbalance is that society reinforces the idea that boys and girls have different interests and capacities. We see this from a very early age when young children receive cars and Lego while girls receive dolls. The former are encouraged to build things, while the latter learn to take care of others. Later, we are told that girls are better in languages or that boys have a better spatial consciousness. In fact, there is no evidence that biological differences between the sexes make one gender more talented than another in a given subject. It is society, not nature, that tells us that girls must favor the arts and humanities and leave mathematics and physics to boys.
Along with this is the lack of positive female models that young people see doing science-related work. Cartoons and stories often show the mad scientist, inventor genius, or adventurous astronaut as a man. In addition, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and separated from the rest of the world. These are false stereotypes portrayed by the media, but they can mean that girls do not identify with scientists, and they see science as an unattractive career. If girls saw more positive female role models in science, it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging to those issues.
In view of these points, it is important to address this issue from the first stage of the child's education. At a time when young women are in college, it may already be too late to refute the view that science 'is not for them'. For very young children, therefore, it is necessary to promote gender-neutral play. As children age, both the education system and the media must raise awareness of women's achievements in the field of science, as well as expose them to a more diverse set of characters in books and films. We need to find ways to show young women that science is fun, interesting and, most importantly, theirs too.

"Lego's profits increased sharply in the first half of 2014, helped by the success of his Lego Movie, which has raided lockers in the United States and the United Kingdom.
Sales of the Danish toy company increased in Europe, America and Asia while children were taking out products linked to the film. The film, released in February, took over 250 million dollars in the United States. and £31 million in the UK for the first weekend of April.
The film costs about $60 million to make and has been described as an almost flawless piece of content marketing by creating entertaining content aimed at consumers who are likely to go out and buy the company's products.
Lego’s financial director, John Goodwin, said: “The strong performance of Lego Movie’s products had a positive effect during the first half of 2014, and it remains to be seen how the line will continue to develop after the much-anticipated release of the film on DVD in the second half of 2014.”
The operating profit of the first six months of Lego's financial year increased by 12% to 630 million dollars. Sales increased 11% to more than three times the figure six years earlier.
Jørgen Vig Knudstorp, executive director of Lego, said: “It is a very satisfactory result that shows our significant growth in recent years in a difficult economic environment. The result for the first half of 2014 is a result of our ability to develop, launch and distribute Lego products, which children around the world put at the top of their wish lists.”
Lego, based in the small town of Billund, began producing its plastic bricks in 1949 and became a basic toy for children around the world by the 1970s. But the group lost its way and was on the verge of collapse in 2003. Knudstrop took over as executive director, ending with 70 years of family rule, and abandoned hundreds of surplus products to redirect the business into its trademark bricks.
The company opened its first factory in China in April and opened an office in Shanghai to head the expansion in the second largest economy in the world.",C1
"Servers hosting the House of Representatives websites and their members have been overwhelmed by millions of emails in recent days, forcing administrators to implement the digital version of a traffic cop to handle overload.
Servers hosting House of Representatives websites have been flooded by millions of emails in recent days.
This is unprecedented, said Jeff Ventura, communications director of the House’s chief administrator.
The waves of emails and page views began after negotiators announced on Sunday that an agreement had been reached on legislation to promulgate a $700 billion bailout of the country's financial system.
In making the announcement, lawmakers said the public could see the deal at financeservices.house.gov.
In a short period of time, many Web users rushed to the digital door to get a copy of this thing, Ventura told CNN in a telephone interview.
While millions of people were trying to see the details of the rescue plan, the House.gov system was overwhelmed and many people saw ads on their computer screens saying that this page did not appear. iReport.com: Support a rescue?
Ventura compared the situation to the old days, when you heard a radio show and the tenth person who called got a toaster. So everyone calls the same number 1-800 at the same time and all you have was a busy signal.
This was a massive busy digital signal, he said.
As more people gained access to the page and the details of the ransom proposal were published in the media, voters began sending an email to their representatives, Ventura explained.
We know that there are millions, he said of the number of e-mails that the House legislators have been receiving. But we haven't counted yet, because when you're about to be hit by a tide wave, you don't count the drops of water in the wave.
After the House failed to approve the proposed agreement on Monday by a vote of 228-205, the volume of email increased again, Ventura said.
Because there were so many emails, which was impacting even House.gov's presentation, he explained.
This morning, our engineers blew the alarms... and we installed a digital version of a traffic cop. We promulgate stops we planned for last night. We were hoping we wouldn't have to.
The office of the administrative director of the House of Representatives issued a statement on Tuesday saying: This measure has become temporarily necessary to ensure that Congress websites are not completely disabled by the millions of emails flowing into the system. The engineers are working diligently to accommodate this huge flow of traffic and we appreciate your patience in this matter.
Now, when House.gov or individual member sites begin to overload, a message will appear on the computer screen saying, in effect, try to come back later, Ventura said.
This really tells us that the level of constituent commitment on this issue is extremely high, he added.
He said that after the failed vote on Monday and the initial reaction, the administrators of the House website thought there would be a drop in web traffic, especially with the Rosh Hashana holiday.
We monitored the situation all night, and technicians and engineers saw that we were facing the same demand as yesterday, Ventura said.
He predicted that traffic on those websites would begin to decrease once there is some guidance on the market and the political picture on what comes next.
Ventura said House.gov's website experienced a very high number of visits when the September 11 commission released its final report on September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, but nothing like what the site has seen in recent days.

"High music through huge speakers, front-row guests rejoice and a parade of stunning models electrifies the dazzling catwalk, welcome to Africa Fashion Week London.
Today, in its third year, the glamorous event saw dozens of great names and emerging designers from across the continent descending into the modern Shoreditch district of the British capital to reveal their latest stylish creations.
Our platform seeks to promote emerging and established African-inspired designers, said Ronke Ademiluyi, founder of the event, held from 1 to 3 August.
The main thing is to draw attention to them, show their creativity to the world so that they get a more global recognition for what they do and more appreciation for their brands as well.
Vibrant colors
The tracks had designs from countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Congo, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Kenya and Morocco, but also from the diaspora, including Great Britain and the Caribbean.
In many ways, the event reaffirmed why African-inspired designs are quickly drawing the attention of the fashion world.
Mixing current trends with traditional patterns, more than 60 designers adorned the walkway with a wide range of colorful creations, ranging from high night dresses and modern informal urban clothing to bold textured prints and lines of elegant accessories.
Glorious colors in the desert: the fashionable women of Darfur
Ademiluyi says that the fashion of the continent today represents a fusion of contemporary and African designs flooded with a lot of vibrant colors and tribal trends.
Among those that give a modern twist to traditional styles is Nigerian designer Fashola Olayinka with her brand based on Lagos MOOFA Designs. His latest collection, Ashake is celebrating the very powerful and strong women who turn their heads wherever they go.
That's basically what the collection is about, says Olayinka, who started the label about four years ago. Women who are very feminine and sexy.
The young designer says that despite existing challenges, such as frequent power outages, it is very exciting to be part of Nigeria's fashion scene right now.
We work hard and have a lot of fun, so it's been a lot of fun and it's a growing process in Nigeria, he says. Nigerians like to dress and many people in Nigeria now wear their own fabrics.
Profile boost
But despite growing interest in African designs, Ademiluyi says that many of the continent's promising talents still find it difficult to get into major international shows.
She says that for many of them, the week is an opportunity to shine on the international stage.
Many of them are talented but struggling, he says. They have no support from anywhere, so what we do is support them, it's an affordable platform for designers to showcase their talents to the world.
South African artist Steve Mandy agrees. He says events like this help participants improve their profile both internationally and at home.
You can meet some very important people here and I've already met some great people here that I think I'll do business with, says Durban-based Mandy, known for hand-painting dresses and T-shirts.
The other thing is spin-off in terms of your own image, in terms of our audience in South Africa -- the fact that you can say that you made African Fashion Week promotes and helps your product to gain integrity.
Looking ahead, Ademiluyi says the goal is to celebrate the event twice a year and also to establish a supply platform that makes designer creations more accessible to the world.
For many of them, after Africa Fashion Week, that's all, he says. Customers don't know where to get their brand, so we hope to support designers much more by opening a distribution outlet.

"The government relies on thousands of legal claims from people who were imprisoned and allegedly mistreated during the last days of the British Empire after the London High Court ruled that three Kenyan elders arrested and tortured during the Mau Mau rebellion have the right to sue for damages.
On Friday the court rejected the claims of government lawyers that it had been too long since the seven years of insurgency in the 1950s, and a fair trial was no longer possible. In 2011, the same High Court judge, Judge McCombe, rejected the government's claim that the three plaintiffs should be suing the Kenyan government, as it had inherited Britain's legal responsibilities for independence in 1963.
Human rights activists in Kenya estimate that more than 5,000 of the more than 70,000 people detained by British colonial authorities are still alive. Many may file claims against the British government. The ruling can also make it possible for victims of colonial atrocities in other parts of the world to sue.
But many more men and women around the world who were imprisoned and allegedly mistreated during the conflicts that often accompanied the British withdrawal from the empire may also be considering claims: cases that could expose evidence of brutal mistreatment of colonial subjects and result in a new and uncomfortable understanding of recent British history.
The Foreign Office acknowledged that the ruling had “potentially significant and far-reaching legal implications, ” and said it was planning to appeal. “The normal time frame for bringing a civil action is three to six years,” a spokesperson said. “In this case, that period has been extended to more than 50 years despite the fact that the main decision-makers are dead and unable to account for what happened.”
The historic victory of Friday for Paulo Muoka Nzili, 85, Wambugu Wa Nyingi, 84, and Jane Muthoni Mara, 73, was the result of a three-year battle through the courts. They had suffered what their lawyers described as “unspeakable acts of brutality,” such as castration, beatings and serious sexual assaults. A fourth claimant withdrew, while a fifth, Susan Ciong’ombe Ngondi, died two years ago, 71 years old.
In the capital of Kenya, Nairobi, news from London was transmitted to two of the complainants, Nyingi and Mara, by mobile phone. They had been sitting quietly with their supporters in a sunburned garden and reacted with joy when the word came, hugging, dancing and eventually raising their hands to heaven to pray.
Nyingi, who was detained for about nine years, beaten unconsciously and bears the marks of the leg mannacles, lashes and lashes, said: “For me... I just wanted the truth to come out. Even my children's children should know what happened. What should happen is that people are compensated so that they can begin to forgive the British government.” Mara said, “I am very happy and my heart is clean.” When asked what he would say to his four children, he simply said, “I’ll tell them I won.”
McCombe said in 2011 that there was “evidence... that there could have been systematic torture of detainees. ” On Friday he ruled that a fair trial was possible, and highlighted the fact that thousands of documents came to light in 2011 after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs admitted in a secret archives file of the colonial era.
In the course of his attempts to eliminate the claims – efforts that the plaintiffs’ lawyer, Martyn Day, described as “morally disgusting” – British government lawyers accepted that the three Kenyan elders were tortured by colonial authorities.
Day said: “The British government has admitted that these three Kenyans were brutally tortured by the British colony and yet have been hiding behind technical legal defenses for three years to avoid any legal liability. There is no doubt that there will be victims of colonial torture from Malaya to Yemen, from Cyprus to Palestine, who will read this trial with great care.”
Among those known to have been watching the case closely are several veterans of the Eoka insurgency in Cyprus in the 1950s. One has already met with the lawyers of the Mau Mau plaintiffs. Cypriot claimants could rely not only on British documentation, but also on the archives of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva. Those files are kept secret for 40 years, and then open to public scrutiny. The Red Cross documented hundreds of cases of torture in Cyprus, where reporters covering the conflict referred to British interrogators such as HMTs – torturers of His Majesty.
There may also be claims from Malaysia, where a large number of people were arrested during the 12-year war with communist insurgents and their supporters that began in 1948. Family members of 24 unarmed rubber plantation workers massacred by British troops are currently fighting through British courts for a public investigation. Many former British prisoners in Aden may also have claims against the British government, although, as Aden is now part of Yemen, British lawyers may have difficulty making contact with potential clients there.

"He had the taste of a typical millionaire. It had a gold and silver Rolex and a fleet of expensive cars. He liked to meddle in modern art. But, although this Chinese businessman had several companies and a palatial village in the suburbs of Madrid, he had almost no money in the bank, a detail that aroused the interest of the Spanish authorities.
Gao Ping, who had lived most of his adult life in Spain, had a monopoly on supplies to 4,000 Chinese bazaars throughout the Mediterranean country. But the authorities suspected that he was not paying taxes on clothes, furniture and other goods that he was importing from China.
When the police slid into their warehouses in 2012 they found lots of cash: wads of €100, €200 and €500 notes were wrapped in elastic bands. About 12 million euros were transported in cars, the largest seizure of cash ever made by the Spanish police. The gang, along with Gao, the alleged ringleader, is accused of washing up to 300 million euros a year, as well as selling counterfeit goods and toys with fake safety marks. The prosecutor said Gao's illegal business was so big that it was damaging Spain's competitiveness. Gao is on bail; the case has not yet come to trial.
Law enforcement officials have been concerned for a long time about €500. Small and easy to transport in relation to their value, they are the method of payment of choice for tax evaders, money launderers and drug barons. The sum of € 1m in € 500 bills fits easily in a small portable bag, where the same amount in € 50 bills would require a small suitcase. Cash mules are known to double notes into plastic pellets and swallow them. A less dangerous method of concealment is to put the tickets in a car chassis.
The United Kingdom suspended the distribution of the Euro500 note in 2010 on the grounds that the claim was “almost entirely for criminal purposes. ” In 2009, the central bank of Italy warned that banknotes were widely used by money launderers and terrorists. Other countries have limited their own high-denominational notes due to links to organized crime: Canada ruled out its $1,000 note in 2000 with the advice of law enforcement officials.
In an era of electronic payment systems and contactless cards, more wonder if the printing of these notes can be justified. Peter Sands, former director of the Standard Chartered Bank, has called for the abolition of high denomination tickets, including 500 €, 100 €, 1,000 Swiss francs and 50 £. In a report for the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, Sands argued that it was time to get rid of the high-value notes that make life easier for “bad people” who pursue tax evasion, financial crime, terrorist finance, and corruption. Although criminals would switch to smaller denomination notes, gold or diamonds, these substitutes are more voluminous and more traceable, making them more likely to be captured, he said.
At a conference on the financing of terrorism in London, the Head of Europol, Rob Wainwright, asked the European Central Bank (ECB) to examine whether it “should continue to produce and distribute these notes to facilitate criminals and terrorists to hide their activities and finance illegal activities”. According to Europol, the 500 euro purple bill represents 30% of the value of all euro banknotes in circulation, although most people have never seen it.
The EUR 500 note was introduced in 2002 when the euro was born: it replaced the DM 1,000, the Belgian francs 10,000 and the Italian lira 500,000. Several European countries were in favour of high-value banknotes. “It’s definitely a preference that has been there for a long time,” says Pia Hüttl, a fellow member of Bruegel’s thinktank. “Preference is based on the idea that cash has a lower cost and is accepted everywhere.”
Cash remains king in Germany and Austria, where more than half of all transactions are made with money in paper and coins. Former president of the German Constitutional Court, Hans-Jürgen Papier, told Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung of Germany that restrictions on cash were at odds with individual freedom, while sensationalist newspaper Bild has launched a petition in defense of paper money, including the €500 note – “send my cash.”
Law enforcement authorities are less convinced, amid a steady stream of reports of suspicious cash packages. In a case that has caught the attention of the police, two men entered a bank and tried to deposit 200,000 euros of torn and muddy 500 euro notes. In the same week, €1.3 million was found in 500 € notes stuffed in the false bottom of the suitcase. But a suspicion of criminality is not enough to keep people in custody. “Our frustration from the point of view of law enforcement is that, in many jurisdictions, it is impossible to provide sufficient evidence to satisfy judicial authorities of a link between suspicious cash detections and crime,” says Jennifer MacLeod, a specialist in Europol’s financial intelligence group. “The search for these links is further complicated by time constraints and fragmentation of cooperation and information exchange”.
The agency would like the central banks to assume more responsibility for the “attack anomalies” in the use of 500€ banknotes. Luxembourg, for example, issued more than twice its annual banknote GDP in 2013 alone, despite being one of the countries with the highest cash revenues in Europe. Europol asked the central bank of Luxembourg for explanations. “The answer we received from Luxembourg is that they simply issue the notes requested and have no explanation for the reasons behind the lawsuit,” says MacLeod. “I am surprised that a central bank does not consider itself responsible in this area.”
This could be changing. Mario Draghi, the head of the ECB, said it is determined that the bank’s income from issuing the notes should not be “a comfort to criminals.” Other members of the ECB’s core team, such as Yves Mersch, argue that there is no evidence of the criminal uses of the 500 euro note. However, in the midst of growing fears about terrorism, this argument may no longer cut off any ice. EU Finance Ministers have asked policy makers to study and report on the “appropriate restrictions” of high-value notes by 1 May 2016.

"President Obama's top collaborators indicated on Sunday that some U.S. troops could start returning from Afghanistan in July 2011, but most would probably stay there for several years.
In the appearances in all the big talk shows, Cabinet officials and military advisers clarified the president's position after walking a loose political line announcing that he will send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan and that some will start returning home in 19 months.
National Security Adviser General James Jones told the State of the CNN Union that the beginning of the withdrawal in July 2011 was not a cliff, it is a ramp to begin handing over security responsibility to Afghan forces.
Taking note of the strategic interests of the U.S. in the region, including nuclear power Pakistan next door, Jones said, ""We're going to be in the region for a long time.
General David Petraeus, head of the U.S. Central Command, said in FOX News on Sunday that Obama's strategy does not rush out, while Defense Secretary Robert Gates told CBS Face the Nation that there is no deadline.
What we have is a specific date when we will begin transferring responsibility from the security districts by district, province by province in Afghanistan to the Afghans, Gates said.
The challenge has been to meet the need that military leaders have cited for more troops and resources to end terrorist networks in Afghanistan and help the Afghan government overcome the Taliban insurgency, while satisfying the liberal base of the Democratic Party, which opposes the deployment of more troops.
Gates explained the reason for sending more forces to ABC's This Week, saying that the Afghan-Pakistani border is the epicenter of extremist jihad.
And Al Qaeda has close relations with the Taliban in Afghanistan, and they have very close relations with the Taliban in Pakistan, Gates continued. The Taliban in Pakistan have been attacking Pakistani civilians, Pakistani government officials, military officers, trying to destabilize the government of Pakistan.
Any Taliban success in Afghanistan or Pakistan benefits Al Qaeda, Gates said, adding that any safe haven on both sides of the border creates opportunities to recruit, raise new funds and make operational planning.
And what's more, the Taliban renaissance in safe havens in western Pakistan is a lesson for al Qaeda that they can return, if they are provided with the kind of safe haven the Taliban were, Gates said.
In addition, Gates warned the NBC's Meet the Press that U.S. casualties will likely continue to grow as troops face the Taliban strongholds. However, Gates rejected a comparison with the Soviet Union's decision in 1985 to send more troops to reinforce its occupation of Afghanistan, which ended in failure less than two years later.
The parallel doesn't work, Gates said. The reality is that the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. They killed a million Afghans. They made 5 million refugees from Afghanistan.
In addition, he said, the Soviets acted unilaterally, while the U.S.-led mission in Afghanistan involves 42 countries with a NATO mandate.
In Congress, Republicans generally supported Obama's deployment plan, but complained that announcing the start of a retreat was a signal to the enemy of a committed commitment.
Arizona Senator John McCain, the failed Republican Party presidential candidate last year, told the NBC Meet the Press that a strategy must be flexible to succeed, rather than be limited by a set timetable.
In FOX News Sunday, Senator Dick Durbin, second Democrat of the House, called the beginning of the retreat in July 2011 a necessary signal for Afghan President Hamid Karzai.
According to Durbin, Obama's message to Karzai was: ""We are not going to make Afghanistan a protectorate of the United States. You have to change your government. They have to prove that they are willing to stand up and fight for their own country.
“I think that message is too late,” Durbin said.

"London is a famous and historic city. It is the capital of England in the UK. The city is very popular for international tourism because London is home to one of the oldest monarchies in the Western Hemisphere. Rita and Joanne recently traveled to London. They were very excited about their trip because this was their first trip abroad from the United States.
Among the places of interest that Rita and Joanne visited are Big Ben, Buckingham Palace and London Eye. Big Ben is one of the most famous monuments in London. It is a large clock tower located at the north end of Westminster Palace. The clock tower is 96 meters long. Unfortunately, Rita and Joanne could only see the tower from the outside. The women learned that the interior of the tower is being renovated until 2021.
Fortunately, the London Eye, the city's famous Ferris wheel, was open to the public. The London Eye is located along the southern banks of the Thames River. This attraction is located 135 meters high. It is one of the best known places in London to get aerial views of the city. Each capsule of the wheel can contain up to 25 passengers. When their capsule stopped at the top of the wheel, the women took spectacular panoramic photographs of the beautiful urban landscape below.
The last place Rita and Joanne visited was Buckingham Palace, the home of the Queen of England. The women were impressed by the incredible architecture and historical value of the palace. Both Rita and Joanne enjoyed seeing the Queen's guards outside the palace. These guards wore red robe uniforms, shiny black boots and bear fur hats. Despite women's attempts to draw the attention of the guards, the guards are specifically trained to avoid distractions. Because of this, the guards completely ignored the women.
Joanne and Rita spent incredible time visiting the city of London, and are inspired to look for more international travel destinations in the future.",C1
"In the broader reform of the Obama administration's national security team to date, the president will appoint the director of the Central Intelligence Agency Leon Panetta as his nominee to succeed Robert Gates as defense secretary, senior US officials said on Wednesday.
General David Petraeus will be nominated to assume the post of CIA director, and Lieutenant General John Allen will succeed Petraeus as head of the U.S.-led international military force in Afghanistan, a senior administration official told reporters. In addition, diplomat Ryan Crocker will be nominated as the next U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, the official said.
President Barack Obama will formally announce the changes on Thursday, according to the senior administration official. It is the biggest remodeling of Obama's national security team since he took office in January 2009 and reflects Gates' long-standing plan to set aside this year.
More changes are also approaching. Both Admiral Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and FBI Director Robert Mueller are not eligible for re-nomination for terms expiring this year.
Gates will resign from June 30, assuming Panetta is confirmed by Congress on time and ready to begin July 1, according to an administration official and a congressional assistant familiar with Gates' phone calls to legislators and senior officials.
Petraeus will remain in command in Afghanistan until Allen is ready to take over in early September, officials said, which might require an interim director of the CIA if Panetta moves to the office of the defense secretary as scheduled on 1 July.
In addition, Petraeus will resign from the military once confirmed to serve as a civilian director of the CIA, officials said.
The initial reaction of the Congress was positive, with key lawmakers on intelligence and security issues praising both Panetta and Petraeus as good options.
The sum total of these elections is that the president has chosen experienced people with unique capabilities to serve our nation at a dangerous time, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said. This team will provide leadership to help make our nation safer. I couldn't be more satisfied with these selections. I hope that these nominees will receive the swift approval of the United States Senate.
Gates was telling lawmakers and staff members that he recommended Panetta to work six months ago, and joked that Panetta stopped talking to him for days for doing so, officials said. In addition, Gates was saying that Allen was a consensus option to succeed Petraeus, according to officials.
He took a meeting with Obama to convince Panetta to accept the job, a source familiar with the discussions told CNN. Panetta has been happy serving in the CIA, but believes firmly in public service and responding to the call of the commander-in-chief, the source said.
Panetta, 72, took over the CIA in February 2009. He served as Chief of Staff for President Bill Clinton between 1994 and 1997, and was previously Director of the Office of Management and Budget (LRB-OMB-RRB). The California Democrat served in the House of Representatives from 1977 to 1993.
Before coming to the CIA, he spent 10 years co-leading a public policy institute with his wife, Sylvia.
He was brought as an alien relative, with no practical intelligence experience, to run an agency that had been shaken by the exposure and criticism of his controversial interrogation and detention program. Panetta's long-standing ties with Congress were seen as a way to restore the administration's relationship with oversight committees. He has been given high ratings on both fronts from inside the agency and in Congress.
David Berteau, senior advisor to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Panetta brings several important qualities to the table.
He learned many lessons about the defense budget during his time as head of the OMB, and knows how to deal with a Republican Congress, as he did during the Clinton administration, Berteau said.
The former Panetta Congressional district in northern California had a huge defense presence, Berteau said.
Panetta has earned Obama's confidence as a CIA leader, and has name recognition, which is important, Berteau said, adding: It's a name Americans recognize. Filling Bob Gatesshoes is gonna be hard work.
Berteau said the election of Petraeus president to lead the CIA indicates that Obama is interested in his views and national security efforts and indicates that the president cares about the way all those pieces fit.
Earlier this month, Petraeus took a very unusual step for a military officer when he publicly recognized the possibility of competing for a presidential appointment.
It is probably not appropriate for me to comment on what might be considered along the way, he told journalists in Kabul when asked about the possible nomination of the CIA. I have had discussions, but again, it would not be appropriate to comment.
Petraeus, 58, assumed command of NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ILB-ISAF-RRB) and the United States. Afghanistan forces on 4 July 2010, after serving for more than 20 months as commander of the United States Central Command. Previously he commanded multinational forces in Iraq, leading the so-called increase. During his time commanding the United States Army/Fort Leavenworth Combined Arms Center, he supervised the development of the Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Manual.
Crocker has previously served as U.S. ambassador to Iraq and Pakistan, while Allen became U.S. Central Command subcomandante in July 2008.
Gates is the only cabinet member of the previous administration who held office when Obama took office. President George W. Bush nominated Gates as the nation's 22nd Secretary of Defense in December 2006 to replace Donald Rumsfeld, one of the architects of the Iraq War facing widespread criticism.
Gates didn't expect to stay after Bush's presidency ended. When asked if I would continue under another administration, Gates said in 2008, I learned a long time ago never to say, so my answer is: The circumstances under which I would make it inconceivable to me.
But those circumstances arose. In December 2008, then-elect President Obama expressed his desire for continuity at the Pentagon, given ongoing conflicts abroad in Iraq and Afghanistan.
I spent a lot of time waiting for the question never to be asked, Gates admitted the day after Obama announced his nomination. But, he said, Obama impressed him.
It's unclear who can replace Mueller at the FBI.
Attorney General Eric Holder on Tuesday did not rule out Mueller staying in the short term when his 10-year term expires in September if a successor has not yet been confirmed. “Mueller will leave hard shoes to fill,” Holder said.
Holder said he's been discussing possible nominees with White House officials, including Vice President Joe Biden. Holder said he believes that if a candidate is selected in May, the administration should have time for the new director to be confirmed in August.
However, if that timeline fails, Mueller's mandate would end on September 4, a week before the tenth anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Mueller has often pointed out that he barely had the opportunity to find his desk before the September 11 attacks occurred, and his entire decade was dominated by the fight against al-Qaeda and its scattered followers both in the country and abroad.

"Israeli troops fired on protesters attempting to cross the fortified border between Syria and the occupied Golan Heights on Sunday, and Syrian authorities reported more than a dozen deaths and hundreds of injuries.
The protests took place on the anniversary of the 1967 Middle East war, when Israel captured the Syrian Golan Heights. Israel Defense Forces did not immediately confirm any casualties, although a spokesman said Israeli troops used tear gas and war ammunition against members of an angry mob.
We verbally warned them - LRB- and -RRB- with warning shots into the air, Lieutenant Colonel Avital Leibovich told CNN. And when these two options failed, we had to fire selectively in the area, and this prevented those Syrians from reaching the Israeli-Syrian fence.
Syrian state news agency said 23 people were killed and more than 350 injured in the protests, which continued after dark. Doctors were seen taking the wounded into vehicles and moving away from the border.
A spokesman for the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, condemned the violence and called for restraint.
The events of today and 15 May on the Golan threaten the prolonged ceasefire. The Secretary-General calls for maximum restraint on all sides and strict observance of international humanitarian law to ensure the protection of civilians, he said.
Up to 500 people participated in the demonstration, celebrating midday prayers on the Syrian side of the border, and then crouched behind the walls that Israel built in response to similar demonstrations three weeks ago. Later, the number was reduced to about 50, with protesters waving Palestinian and Syrian flags.
On Sunday, clashes also broke out between Palestinians and Israelis at the Qalandia crossing between Jerusalem and Ramallah in the West Bank. At least six Palestinians were wounded there, one seriously, by rubber bullets. Israeli forces also fired tear gas, while Palestinians threw stones.
The clashes occurred three weeks after similar demonstrations marking the birth of the Jewish State in 1948, a day of mourning for Palestinians, more than 700,000 of whom were displaced from their homes during the ensuing fighting. Those protests left at least 12 dead.
Leibovich accused Syria of trying to use the protests to create a distraction from the bloodshed that is taking place inside Syria, where the United Nations says that a crackdown on anti-government protests has left more than 1,000 dead.
“There is no doubt about it,” he said. The cops, the Syrian armed forces look back and do nothing.
Protesters arrived on at least eight buses before the protest began, and then came down a hill known locally as Shouting Hill, where people yell at family and friends across the border, at the walls that Israeli forces built last month.
Leibovich said Israeli troops were better prepared to deal with demonstrations than with the May 15 protests, reinforcing forces along the border and making it clear that we would not tolerate any infiltration on the Israeli side.

"You want a job as a music journalist? This is your chance. We're looking for a new lead reviewer for Hot! The magazine, but we're not interviewing for the job. Instead, write a review of your favorite album. We want to know why you love it and why you think everyone should listen to it. Convince us and you'll get the job!
I'm certainly not alone with my favorite album. In fact, Bruce Springsteen's Born in the USA has sold 30 million copies worldwide since its release in 1984. Almost 30 years later, in 2013, Springsteen performed the full album in concert for the delight of some of his many die-hard fans.
A rock album fast-paced and foot-stepping, Born in the lyrics of the U.S. However, they have emotional weight. Behind the catchy rock melodies that drive these power classics are stories of the dark side of the American dream. Many clues deal with the struggles of ordinary and hardworking people and the bitterness and anger they feel as life does not bring them wealth or glory. The song Glory Days, for example, deals with people in a small village looking back when they were young and had the world at their feet as Downbound Train tells the story of a young man whose life is ruined when he loses his job. It's not hard to imagine that the artist is channeling to real people he knew and the life he could have had if he hadn't become a star. The album will certainly leave you the unique and extraordinary talent of Boss.
Unlike many other best-selling album artists, Springsteen is still launching chart-topping, filling the stadium with new music and remaining at the top of his game in the late 1960s. I'm not surprised at all. This is a man who tells us our most fundamental stories about ourselves and, when you listen to Born in the U.S., those stories are as relevant today as they always were.",C1
"During the 1970s, one of the biggest movements in the United States was the struggle for equal rights. Many members of American society felt deprived of rights and discriminated against, especially in the workplace. Some American workers enjoyed a full living wage with benefits and other advantages, while others struggled to earn enough to survive. One of the most oppressed groups of workers during this period was the California farmers.

Peasants were migrant workers who arrived in the country mostly without documentation to work in the fertile fields of California's Great Central Valley. This region of central California has often been described as the country's fruit basket due to its rich soil and high yields. Agricultural workers cared for these fields during the day, and lived and slept on the farm at night. They earned less than the state's minimum wage, and had no marginal benefits enjoyed by other American workers. Cesar Chavez changed all that.
César Chávez, the Arizona-born civil rights activist and worker leader, became the voice of these workers, and began a movement to bring basic rights to this group. Taking the lead of the great Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Chávez began a series of nonviolent demonstrations protesting the deplorable conditions the peasants had to endure. Many of these workers worked much more than eight hours a day, and were not paid overtime. Chávez, who was an agricultural worker in the 1950s, led marches and called for boycotts. These activities were very effective in changing the working conditions of peasants and other oppressed workers.
Chávez was highly recognized during his life, and his legacy increased after his death in 1993. It has achieved an iconic status among the Mexican-American community.",C1
"Report on staff participation in Girox Foods
Introduction
At Girox Foods, we are experiencing an annual employee turnover of around 12%. Although this may not seem high at first glance, the industry standard is 7%. The main objective of this report is to investigate the causes of employee engagement within the company and, based on them, to provide recommendations for improving employee experience in the workplace and increasing employee retention.
Research methods
This study was conducted with more than 500 employees of Girox Foods between March and August 2018, with the aim of understanding their experience and expectations in the workplace. The study covered the 80 branches of Girox Foods located in 20 European countries. In addition to the 500 questionnaires filled out by Girox employees, 120 also participated in ten different discussion groups, in which participants participated in discussions about their levels of engagement in Girox and their hopes for the future.
Main results of the investigation
The main reason for the separation of employees given by 35% of respondents is the lack of difficult work, followed by too many working hours (34%).
Forty-three per cent of respondents said that the main reason for employees to leave their jobs was lack of recognition, while 31 per cent stated that it was due to mismanagement.
There was no correlation between salaries and employee participation.
Forty-seven per cent stated that their levels of participation would improve if they felt more in charge of their work. 45 per cent wanted more flexibility in terms of both working hours and workplaces. 42% wanted the company to invest more in its professional development.
Fifty-nine per cent believed that their commitment to the company would be enhanced if they were given training opportunities to improve their entrepreneurial skills. 64% considered social and intercultural intelligence to be the most important skill needed in the workplace.
Forty-one per cent of respondents felt that there should be greater transparency in corporate communications, as this would lead to increased confidence and more informed decision-making.
Recommendations
Based on these findings, we recommend that Girox Foods adopt a more people-oriented management style. As part of this, we need to explore ways to offer more flexible working hours to our employees and consider how we can allow employees to work from their chosen locations. Managers should consider a variety of ways to challenge our staff and provide more positive reinforcement and recognition of their work. Increased investment in professional development, especially in the area of social and intercultural communication, could also contribute to creating a positive environment for employees to produce their best work.",C1
"A few days after giving birth to her second child, Dr. Jane Dimer took home from the hospital to find her husband in bed with another woman. He threw Dimer down the stairs, and she never saw him again until the court.
Rihanna was allegedly attacked by her boyfriend, singer Chris Brown, before the Grammys on February 8.
Say, now an obstetrician-gynaecologist at Group Health Cooperative in Seattle, Washington, she had been in an abusive relationship with her husband in Germany for four and a half years until she was kicked out 11 years ago.
Emotionally, the remains of that stay for a long time, he said.
Domestic violence is the most common cause of injury to women aged 15 to 44, according to the National Institutes of Health. With the entertainment world buzzing about the pop Rihanna sensation, whose boyfriend Chris Brown has been formally accused of assaulting her, the public interest in domestic violence has been revitalized.
Abuse can influence the victim's future behavior in relationships and even friendships, depending on whether the victim stays or leaves, said Mark Crawford, a clinical psychologist based in Roswell, Georgia. Those who stay are likely to stop relying on their own perceptions and become passive in both romantic and non-romantic relationships.
Victims who leave -- which is the healthiest option, Crawford said -- often become too well-off because they want to avoid conflicts, even verbal disputes, at all costs. Some women do not trust people easily, if they do, and are not able to handle even normal expressions of anger. Visit CNNHealth.com, your connection to a better life
What you have to do when you leave the relationship is make sure you are aware of your own anger, and then you can learn to express it freely in a healthy and normal way, he said. If someone still has problems 10 years later, they just haven't worked on it. They haven't healed; they need to do that.
New investigations show that victims of abuse feel the impact of violence long after it occurred. A recent study in the Journal of Women's Health revealed that African American elderly women who were exposed to high levels of family violence at some point in their lives -- whether by their partner or by a family member -- were at increased risk of poor mental and physical health.
Not only does violence continue, which everyone thinks, but even when it is over, there is something about what happens that seems to have a persistent effect that we still don't understand, Dr. Anuradha Paranjape, co-author of the study and associate professor at the School of Medicine at the University of Temple.
It makes sense for abused women to report worse health, as people in stressful situations have higher levels of stress hormones, which interfere with immune function, Crawford said.
Other studies show a clear connection between depression and abuse. Adult women who have been abused in a relationship in the last five years have rates of depression 2 1/2 times higher than women who have never been abused, according to a different study of more than 3,000 women. They are also more likely to be socially isolated, said author Amy Bonomi, an associate professor at Ohio State University.
Women who have been abused before, but not during, the last five years had depression rates 1 1/2 times higher than those with no abuse experience, said Bonomi, who has collaborated with Dimer in research on abused women.
“People like to think that, well, abuse is just when you have a black eye, you hold a broken bone,” Bonomi said. But we see a lot of different effects in other areas, like depression and social isolation, and we have actually shown that with the data.
Women who have experienced violence also seem to be more likely to abuse substances, but it is not clear how the two are related -- one does not necessarily cause the other, and there may be other factors involved, Bonomi said.
A 2008 study of 3,333 women, in which Bonomi worked, revealed that middle-aged women who suffered child abuse, sexual abuse or other physical abuse were more likely to be depressed, as well as a higher body mass index. These women also spend as much as one third more than the average on health care costs. About 34 per cent of women in the sample said that they had been abused.
While the Paranjape study found that women with the highest levels of abuse reported poor health, the same number of diseases were reported among those women as the women in the sample who had less or no abuse. This indicates that there is something else that makes battered women report feeling bad, he said.
When your patient says they don't feel so good, you might want to think about asking what other problems may be going on, he said.
People who have come out of a relationship must go through the work of learning what problems set them in that situation, and reflect on the warning signs, Crawford said.
Experts recommend finding a counselor and other means of support, but people who have been abused should think twice about revealing too much in online support groups, because their abusers might find out what they are saying, Dimer said. Research has also shown that violence is intensifying in abusive relationships between couples who go to marriage therapy, he said.
Some women feel stronger after having gone through the experience of abuse, Dimer said. She herself found healing through advocacy and research on the subject, she said.
Calling a domestic violence phone line is a good first step for anyone who is experiencing abuse, Dimer said.
Whether you're a pop star or someone who's working on the front line -- an employee at a grocery store selling the pop star magazine -- you're at the same risk for having this, he said.

"It fits in four minutes. Sounds like a headline in a health magazine; an unattainable promise on nighttime satellite television. Then you try Dr. Izumi Tabata's training protocol – 20 seconds of total effort, 10 seconds of rest, repeat eight times – and between sounding like Darth Vader while you desperately aspirate in oxygen and collapsing into a messy package of sweat and defeat, you realize how wrong you were.
Tabata's seen it all before. “They were dead!” he laughs as he remembers the first time he inflicted the system that bears his name on his college students in the early 1990s. “After four minutes of hard exercise they were eliminated. But after six weeks they saw the results and were surprised. We all were.
His research followed extensive follow-up to Japan's fast skating team in the early 1990s, when he – along with team coach Irisawa Koichi – noticed that short bursts of brutally hard exercise seemed to be at least as effective as moderate training hours. Tabata set out to show this with a simple experiment. A group of moderately trained students performed one hour of constant cardiovascular exercise on a stationary bike five times a week. The other group warmed up for ten minutes on the bike, followed by four minutes of Tabata intervals, four times a week – plus a 30 minute session of constant exercise with two minutes of intervals.
The results were surprising. After six weeks of testing, the group that followed Tabata’s plan – exercising only 88 minutes a week – had increased its anaerobic capacity by 28% and its maximum VO 2, a key indicator of cardiovascular health and maximum aerobic potency, by 15%. The control group, which trained for five hours each week, also improved its maximum VO 2, but by 10% – and its training had no effect on anaerobic capacity. “We have also measured increases in heart size after three weeks of making the protocol,” Tabata says. “And there’s also a next investigation that shows that the risk of diabetes in humans is decreasing, which we’ve already shown in rats.”
But there are no half measures here. You can't go steady on a cross trainer, chew gum and read the latest issue of HELLO! The regime requires head-down bursts on a stationary bike or rowing machine; explosive body weight exercises, sprints or the like. Do you remember how you felt after running 100 meters at school? Imagine doing eight of them with just a 10-second break to recover.
“A total effort at 170% of your VO 2 maximum is the protocol criterion,” says Tabata. “If you feel good afterwards you haven’t done it properly. The first three repetitions will feel easy, but the last two will feel impossible. In the original plan the goal was to reach eight, but some lasted only six or seven.”
As one commentator at the popular T-Nation exercise forum says: “When it is done correctly you must know God. Most people are unable to do it properly and should not even try.”
Tabata doesn't quite agree. “Everyone can do it, but beginners must start with educated coaches so they can work with the right intensity for them,” he explains. He says he will soon publish research that shows that doing the program only twice a week, less than half the volume of the original research, still provides significant health benefits.
Another soon - to - be - published finding, which Tabata describes as “rather significant, ” shows that the Tabata protocol burns 150 additional calories within 12 hours after exercise, even at rest, due to the effect of excess oxygen consumption after exercise. So while it is used by most people to get fit – or by people in shape to get even more fit – it also burns fat.
It is a little surprising, therefore, that the plan remains the reserve for the serious multitude of athletes and musclehead – although that may change now that Tabata has agreed to an agreement with Universal Studios that will lead to a network of instructors and a range of DVDs released towards the end of the year. “I decided to do this because I often go on YouTube and, while I’m honored that people are doing it, some are doing it wrong because they don’t realize the intensity you need to work on,” Tabata says.
So should we start incorporating this plan into our fitness regimens? Richard Scrivener, a former assistant trainer of strength and conditioning at Northampton Saints Rugby Club, says that while the benefits are clear, Tabatas are an addition, not a replacement, to a favorite sport or training method. “The runners, for example, need a high level of functioning economy, which comes from acquiring skills and putting them in the miles,” says Scrivener, “but they could effectively ease long runs and reduce overall mileage by introducing Tabata training. This will download the skeleton and give the joints the opportunity to rest and recover, especially if you are prone to niggles or have a history of injuries – and therefore, you would probably get more of the long runs when you perform them.”
The gym rats can benefit by doing three strength sessions and three Tabatas a week. And the rest of us can build session by session, week by week, all the time knowing that it will never be easier because each session requires maximum effort. That is the cruel genius of protocol: it is implacable – and effective.

"When the Taliban sent a gunman to shoot Malala Yousafzai in October 2012 while traveling home on a bus after school, they made clear their intention: to silence the teenager and kill her campaign for girls' education.
Nine months and countless surgical operations later, he rose at the United Nations on Friday on his 16th birthday to deliver a defiant raffle. “They thought the bullet would silence us. But they failed,” he said.
As he turned 16, he was one of the most unusual. Instead of blowing candles on a cake, Malala sat in one of the main halls of the Council of the United Nations, at the headquarters, usually reserved for world leaders.
She listened quietly when Ban Ki-moon, the UN Secretary General, described her as “our hero, our champion”; and as the former British Prime Minister and now UN Education Envoy Gordon Brown pronounced what he called “the words the Taliban never wanted me to hear: happy birthday 16, Malala.”
The event, called Malala Day, was the culmination of four extraordinary years for the girl of Mingora, in the turbulent Swat Valley in Pakistan. She was pushed into public glare after she wrote a blog for the BBC Urdu service describing her experiences struggling to get an education under the growing power of Taliban militants.
At the age of 11, he was showing exceptional determination, personally asking the U.S. Special Representative in Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke, to use his influence to combat the Taliban's campaign against girls' education. At the age of 14, she was on the radar of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who presented her for the International Children's Peace Prize, and at the age of 15, she became the youngest Nobel Peace Prize ever nominated.
But such dizzying global attention came at a price. The death threats followed their growing recognition, and on 9 October 2012, following a meeting of Pakistani Taliban leaders, the gunman was sent to eliminate what they called the “symbol of the infidels and obscenity. ”
Several operations in Pakistan and the United Kingdom followed the attack on the bus, including the placement of a titanium plate on its left forehead and a cochlear implant to restore its hearing. He now lives with his family in Birmingham and does what the Taliban tried to stop: he goes to school every day. “I’m not against anyone,” he said in the UN camera, having pulled this day out of the classroom. Nor am I here to speak in terms of personal revenge against the Taliban or any other terrorist group.”
Malala responded to Taliban violence with his own compensatory force: words against bullets. I don't even hate the talib who shot me. Even if I had a gun in my hand and it was in front of me, I wouldn't shoot him.
She spoke with confidence, with only one injured eye and a slightly fallen left side of her face to insinuate such fresh traumas. There was another undeclared allusion to the horror of his past: he wore a white shawl belonging to a woman who was also a target of extremists but who, unlike Malala, did not survive to tell the story: Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's former prime minister.
“Extremists are afraid of books and pens,” the teenager continued. “The power of education frightens them. They're afraid of women. The power of women's voices frightens them.
He cited the June attack on a hospital in Quetta, capital of Baluchistan, and the killing of female teachers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “That’s why they are bombing schools every day, because they were and are afraid of change, fear of equality that we will bring into our society.”
And he gave his own opposite interpretation of Islam to that of the Taliban. “They believe that God is a little conservative being who would send the girls to hell just by going to school. Terrorists are misusing the name of Islam and Pashtun society for their own personal benefits. Islam is a religion of peace, humanity and brotherhood. Islam says that it is not only the right of every child to receive education, but that it is his duty and responsibility.”
Such ability to articulate what is not normally articulated – to give voice to young people normally silenced – has generated their own response. The “Stand with Malala” petition, which calls for education for 57 million children around the world who do not go to school, has attracted more than four million signatures – over a million have been added shortly after Malala’s speech.
At the beginning of his speech, Malala said: “I don’t know where to start my speech. I don’t know what people would expect me to say.” She doesn't have to worry.

"North Korea has confirmed to Swedish diplomats that it has a U.S. citizen, the U.S. Department of State said Friday.
The State Department has refused to confirm the identity of the citizen, citing privacy issues. But Merrill Newman's 85-year-old family from Palo Alto, California, has said he has been detained in North Korea since October 26.
Washington has no diplomatic relations with Pyongyang, and has been working through Sweden -- the protective power of the United States in North Korea -- to obtain information about Americans.
We are working closely with representatives of the Swedish Embassy to resolve this issue, and they have also requested consular access on a daily basis, State Department spokesman Jennifer Psaki told journalists.
The revelation came on the same day as Newman's wife, Lee, pleaded for his release.
The family feels that there has been a terrible misunderstanding that led to his arrest and asks that - LRB-North Korea-RRB- work to resolve this issue quickly and to return this 85-year-old grandfather to his anxious and concerned family, he said in a statement.
Newman, a retired Korean War veteran and financial consultant, was last seen aboard a Pyongyang flight to Beijing. A few minutes before the plane departed, he was withdrawn from the flight by the North Korean authorities, the family said.
He has been detained somewhere in North Korea since then, Newman's wife said in the statement.
According to the family, Newman and a fellow traveler, Bill Hamrdla, had been on a 10-day private tour of North Korea.
The family said that Newman suffered from a heart condition and only had enough medication for the trip.
We have not heard about the state of his health, whether the drugs sent to him through the Swedish Embassy in North Korea have been delivered or why he was arrested, the statement said.
The day before Newman left North Korea, he and his tour guide met with one or two Korean authorities, his son said.
During that meeting, Newman's service record was discussed, Jeff Newman said.
I understand my father was a little upset, Newman told CNN. But neither he nor his traveling companion believed there was a problem.
This week the U.S. issued a warning to U.S. citizens against any trip to North Korea, which has become a magnet for adventure travelers after Pyongyang lifted some of its travel restrictions.
Newman was a customer of Juche Travel Services in London, said the spokesman for the company David Thompson in a written statement.
The arrangements for the tour were handled by the Korea International Travel Company, Thompson said. Mr. Newman had all the travel documents necessary and valid for his tour. We have no information on what has occurred as a result of the current situation.
The 10-day private tour, which included the use of a tour guide, was the culmination of months of planning, Newman's wife said.
The postcards sent to friends during that trip describe good times, good weather and knowledgeable guides, he said in the statement.
The family statement came one day after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry asked North Korea to release the detained Americans, calling the arrests very, very disturbing elections of the North Koreans.
Newman is one of two U.S. citizens detained in North Korea.
The other, Kenneth Bae, was arrested in November 2012 and sentenced in May to 15 years of hard labour. The North Korean government has said he was found guilty of hostile acts and attempts to overthrow the government.
North Korea has not publicly said why it is holding Newman.
Is the American man detained in North Korea a currency?
Among the possibilities is his military service. He served as an Army infantry officer during the Korean War, which saw North Korea fight South Korea, the United States and the United Nations between 1950 and 1953.
An armistice signed in 1953 ended the three-year war between North and South Korea. Both sides technically remain at war.
It is also possible that the North Korean authorities confused him with another Merrill Newman, a Korean War veteran who awarded the Silver Star for combat value.
It is known that North Korean authorities systematically carry out background checks on foreigners, travel agencies warn potential visitors.
The first decorated combat veteran who learned about Newman's arrest was in a phone call from the San José Mercury News, which reported for the first time the American's arrest.
I thought it was a coincidence. I didn't think much about it, Merrill Newman from Beaverton, Oregon, told CNN.
From his service during the war, he just said: I went there, did what I was told and went home, went to college and started a family... That's what you did in those days.
How to travel to North Korea
News of the apparent arrest came as talks were taking place between the United States and China, North Korea's closest ally, on the resumption of negotiations to dismantle Pyongyang's nuclear program.
The moment raises questions as to whether North Korea plans to use Newman as a currency in the negotiations, a measure that the West has previously accused of doing to try to obtain concessions with the negotiations.
Newman's arrests raise the number of U.S. citizens who have been detained by North Korea to at least seven, including four who allegedly entered the country illegally, according to the State Department.
Two other U.S. citizens who entered the country on valid visas were arrested for other reasons, and U.S. officials have received reports that other Americans were arbitrarily detained, according to the State Department.
Americans previously detained in North Korea have been released when high-profile visitors have traveled to the country to defend their case. In particular, former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter were on two separate occasions in 2010.
Former governor of New Mexico. Bill Richardson, former ambassador to the United Nations, has visited North Korea several times over the years, most recently this year to discuss Bae's release.
Richardson's spokesman, Caitlin Kelleher, said she has been in contact with her North Korean contacts regarding Newman's arrest.
The pictures of North Korea don't want you to see them.

"Henry Ford was an American inventor who was credited with the invention of the auto assembly line. The German car manufacturer, Karl Benz, was credited with the invention of the first vehicle in the late 1880s, but Ford was the man who made it possible for everyday citizens to have one. Before Ford came up with his assembly line process, the cars were built one at a time by hand, which was a very costly and inefficient production method. Ford's assembly line revolutionized the way cars were built, and their methods are still in use today.

In 1886, Benz patented its Motorwagen, which was a four-wheel and two-passenger motor vehicle that was designed to replace the horse and cart. These vehicles were expertly crafted, but were available only to the richest people of the time. Thanks to Ford, everything changed in 1906. Your Ford Motor Company, the first car company to use assembly line techniques to build cars. transformed the car from an expensive curiosity to a practical tool that could be used to transport people and goods easily and efficiently. Its first serially produced product was Model T. It remains one of the best-selling vehicles in history, and was the first to reach 15 million sales.
Ford's impact on the 20th century cannot be overstated. At one time it was estimated that nine out of 10 vehicles on American roads were Fords. Their cars boosted the U.S. economy like no other factor. The country's roads were built in response to the large number of Ford vehicles and subsequent American car manufacturers produced. In addition, Ford vehicles created a network of support industries such as parts, repair and maintenance services. It also caused a revolution in how the goods were transported in the country. Henry Ford was a real American icon.",C1
"Massachusetts Port Authority officials issued an apology Wednesday after conducting a fire training exercise at Boston Logan International Airport on the 12th anniversary of the September 11 attacks.
Firefighters will be training this morning. Smoke at the airfield is part of the training, announced the airport's Twitter account.
In response to negative reactions on social networks, the port authority, which operates the airport, said in a statement, Massport apologizes for carrying out the fire training exercise and understands that it may have offended many of those affected by the events of September 11.
It's silly, Governor. Deval Patrick said. The moment couldn't be worse.
American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 traveled from Logan and hit the World Trade Center towers in New York City after being hijacked on September 11, 2001.
The terrorist attack organized by Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden killed 2,977 people in New York City, Washington, DC and Pennsylvania, in the worst such attack in U.S. history.
Steve MacDonald, spokesman for the Boston Fire Department, told CNN on Wednesday that the department had no involvement and that the airport used its own fire department for the exercise.
Security is our top priority and constant vigilance and preparedness is critical, but the exercise should not have taken place on the 11 September anniversary, Massport's apology said. The airport community recognizes the day with moments of silence, a service in the chapel and a crown in the monument of September 11.

"The de facto president of Honduras denied Wednesday that his government would put out power at the embassy where deposed President José Manuel Zelaya reappeared surprisingly this week, and said that people inside were free to come and go.
A soldier takes a photo Wednesday of the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa, Honduras.
Honduran forces will also not enter the Brazilian embassy, where Zelaya has been hosted since Monday, de facto President Roberto Micheletti said in an interview with CNN in Spanish.
But these events do not forgive Zelaya, who was overthrown in a coup d'état on 28 June, from being arrested and facing charges for violating the Constitution if he leaves the safe haven of the embassy, Micheletti said.
President Zelaya should stand before the courts of our country where he has charges against him, Micheletti said.
The de facto president challenged the versions of events surrounding Zelaya's return.
Despite local reports quoting police officers that the authorities turned off power to the embassy and its surroundings apparently to discourage looting, Micheletti said a congregation of pro-Zelaya protesters in the embassy shortened power themselves.
Starting Wednesday, the energy was restored to the building, Micheletti said.
A national curfew was lifted on Wednesday, but a security cordon remained in the area around the embassy.
Micheletti said the police were there because the people inside the embassy asked for protection, and said: We are not preventing the departure or entry of absolutely anyone.
Zelaya's announced return has rekindled a confrontation between the two disputed leaders of Honduras. Brazil is now involved because of its embassy.
Brazil wants an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the situation, the official Brazilian news agency reported.
In another event, Micheletti said he is willing to meet anywhere with the deposed President José Manuel Zelaya as long as Zelaya agrees to abide by the presidential elections scheduled for November 29. But the de facto leader said in a statement read by his chancellor on Tuesday that his offer to speak to Zelaya does not nullify an arrest warrant issued against the deposed president by the nation's Supreme Court of Justice.
I think what the whole world should understand about this country is that there is no immunity for anyone, for anyone, Micheletti told CNN in Spanish. And no one can be above the law.
Micheletti's willingness to involve Zelaya seemed to be a change of position. On Tuesday, he had said in an interview with the local network Televicentro that Zelaya's sudden appearance would not revive the negotiations for him to return to power.
The United States and Brazil have said they support the dialogue between the two parties, focused on the San José Agreement, an agreement negotiated by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias. That agreement requires Zelaya to be returned to power.
The Brazilian request for a Security Council meeting came after the Honduran government isolated the embassy by cutting water, electricity and telephone lines to the building, U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly confirmed to reporters Tuesday in Washington.
This was the same action that Micheletti denied on Wednesday.
Micheletti said other nations have not given his government a fair hearing of his position.
This is what we Hondurans want: to be heard, to read our constitution, to read our laws, and to see what happened before June 28, said Micheletti.
The de facto government maintains that Zelaya was not removed in a coup, but in a constitutional transfer of power.
Zelaya, a centrist whose policy took a strong left turn once in office, was overthrown in a military-backed coup on June 28. Despite growing political, diplomatic and economic isolation, Micheletti has strongly resisted pressure to allow Zelaya to return to power and Micheletti thwarted two public attempts by Zelaya to return to his homeland.
“Yes, we are alone, but we are surviving,” Micheletti said. Two months ago, people didn't think we'd hold on all this time, but here we are almost three months later.
Amnesty International issued a statement on Wednesday in which the human rights group denounced a sharp increase in police beatings, mass arrests of protesters and intimidation of human rights defenders in Honduras since the June coup d'état and warned that fundamental rights and the rule of law in the Central American nation are in grave danger.
The organization said the police fired tear gas on Tuesday in a building that houses a prominent human rights organization. About 100 people, including women and children, were inside, Amnesty International said. Many were there to denounce what they said were police abuses when they broke the demonstration outside the Brazilian Embassy, the human rights group said.
The situation in Honduras can only be described as alarming, said Susan Lee, director of Amnesty International for the Americas. Attacks on human rights defenders, the suspension of the media, the beating of demonstrators by the police and the increasing reports of mass arrests indicate that human rights and the rule of law in Honduras are in grave danger.
It was not yet publicly known on Wednesday how Zelaya entered the country and refused to give details, just telling CNN in Spanish on Tuesday that it was a 15- to 16-hour trip he made with the help of Hondurans.
Journalist Elvin Sandoval contributed to this report for CNN in Spanish.

"Lakshmi Tatma, two years old, an Indian girl born with four arms and four legs, made her first public appearance on Tuesday, a week after surgeons in India successfully removed her extra limbs.
The doctors said Lakshmi was recovering well and appeared Tuesday at a press conference.
Lakshmi, carrying a cast lying on her legs to keep her feet up and her legs together to help heal her wounds, was taken to a press conference on Tuesday when her doctors announced that she would be released from intensive care.
“She is doing very well,” Chief Surgeon Dr. Sharan Patil said. It's taken by her mother and father.
Several of his doctors, all smiling, described his recovery during the past week as very steady and good progress, one of whom says he is out of danger in terms of serious medical problems. See the recovery of the girl know the media
The operation a week ago lasted 27 hours and involved a team of about 30 surgeons, all specialists in pediatrics, neurosurgery, orthopaedics and plastic surgery, working in eight-hour shifts.
The additional members of Lakshmi were part of a bonded twin that stopped developing in the uterus. He had a torso and limbs, but no head, and joined Lakshmi in the pelvis.
Doctors said that without surgery, Lakshmi would have been unlikely to survive beyond early adolescence.
The surgery involved removing the additional limbs and repositioning of Lakshmi's organs.
When Lakshmi was born into his poor Indian rural family, villagers in the remote settlement of Rampur Kodar Katti in the northern state of Bihar believed it to be sacred. As the news of their birth spread, the locals lined up to receive a blessing from the baby.
Her parents, Shambhu and Poonam Tatma, called the girl for the Hindu goddess of wealth that has four arms. However, they were forced to keep it hidden after men who offered money came to them in exchange for putting their daughter into a circus.
The couple, who earned only $1 a day as casual day laborers, wanted her to have the operation, but could not pay for the rare procedure, which had never been done in India before.
After Patil visited the girl in her village from Narayana Health City hospital in Bangalore, the hospital foundation agreed to fund the $200,000 operation.
Surgery planning took a month, Patil said, and Lakshmi spent that month in the hospital.
Many villagers, however, continued to oppose surgery and planned to erect a temple to Lakshmi, whom they still worship as sacred. E-mail to a friend

"If your vision of the world comes from watching the news and reading the newspapers, you could be forgiven for being awake at night worrying about the future. Apparently, increasing violence and population rates mean that human beings are killing each other in increasing numbers and are born at rates that the world's resources cannot sustain. To make matters worse, all wealth is concentrated in a handful of people in the richest countries in the world. People in low-income countries live in poverty while the West enriches. Depressive, isn't it?
But do statistics support our negative view of the world or is the world really improving?
Let's take the world's population first. It's about 7 billion now, in line with the figures predicted by the UN in 1958. By the year 2100, the same experts predict that it will be about 11 billion. But did you know that 11 billion is probably as high as that number will come? The rate of increase will decrease in the second half of this century due to the decline in birth rates today.
Falling birth rates? Yeah, that's right.
Over the past two centuries, improved technology and health have led to fewer young children dying, fueling rapid population growth. These numerous families produced even more children who survived adulthood and had their own children. However, with the increased availability of contraceptives in the 1960s, the global average number of babies per woman has declined from six to two.
Poverty is the highest infant mortality factor. And while it is still true that only 20% of the world receives about 74% of the world's income, 60% of the world now falls into a middle-income group, with 11.6% – the lowest number of people in history – still living in extreme poverty. If most of the world's population has money, international aid could realistically achieve the United Nations goal of eradicating poverty by 2030. As poverty declines, life expectancy increases, birth rates decline because parents can expect their current children to survive and the world population to stabilize.
As for the news that makes us think that the world is an increasingly violent place, there is also reason for a certain optimism. Between the end of World War II and 1990, there were 30 wars that killed more than 100,000 people. Today there are still civil wars, but most countries coexist more peacefully than in the past. However, terrorism has skyrocketed in recent years and, since World War II, wars have killed many more civilians than soldiers. However, even for civilians, statistics are not all bad. Although deaths are nine times more likely to result from violent crimes than from political conflicts, the global murder rate declined slightly, from 8 per 100,000 people in 2000 to approximately 5.3 in 2015.
Of course, none of this means that the world is perfect, and if you personally are affected by war and poverty is often reduced to the lottery from where you are born. Furthermore, we continue to face enormous problems of our own creation, in particular environmental ones, such as global warming, and wealth and natural resources must be distributed more fairly. But not all the news is bad news, whatever the television and the newspapers say.",C1
"Dozens of Roman Catholic bishops in South America say that human trafficking has experienced alarming growth in the region.
The 60 bishops of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay issued a statement after a meeting in Argentina last week, calling this practice a shameful and outrageous reality and promising to do more to combat it.
We warned of the existence of organized mafias using smaller networks that are present in almost all our cities and towns, the statement said.
More information on The CNN Freedom Project
Citing reports from global non-profit groups, the bishops noted that sexual trafficking networks were also operating in the area.
The bishops undertook to raise awareness of the problem, to promote legal reforms and to help the victims, noting that within the church there had been an absence of proposals dedicated to attracting young people - LRB- to the church -RRB-, and the absence of a more decisive and comprehensive response to the problem - LRB- of trafficking in persons -RRB-.
Such an approach is not surprising, said Sergio Rubin, a journalist who has written extensively about the Catholic Church in Argentina.
The church is taking on its role, and they think they should work much more in the formation of religious values, Rubin said.
Mario Ganora, a lawyer working with La Alameda, an Argentine non-profit organization that helps victims of human trafficking, said the increase in human trafficking was related to an increase in drug use.
How? Women who are used for sex trafficking are also used for drug delivery, he said.
According to official data from the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights of Argentina, 176 people were rescued from human trafficking networks in Argentina in April, a larger number than the entire previous quarter.

"A proposal for a digital version of the university newspaper
Introduction
This proposal aims to outline how a digital version of the university newspaper, The Scallion, could work and aims to show that an online newspaper is viable for the future of the newspaper. It is based on the opinions of 3,000 students surveyed in May.
Background
The Scallion is printed weekly and distributed free of charge in the faculty buildings, with a readership of approximately 10,000 students. It is written and produced entirely by students. The survey shows that the newspaper is highly valued by university students and staff for entertainment, cultural enrichment and work experience.
Current challenges
The cost of printing newspapers is significant. In addition, some students do not have easy access to the newspaper, as the only way to get a copy is to go to college physically. An additional environmental problem is that a large number of copies end up as garbage on campus.
Proposed solution
It is proposed that the newspaper be changed to an online format. An overwhelming majority (95%) of respondents were ""keen"" or ""very interested"" in this.
The main benefits would be:
Lower costs. Electronic publishing is much cheaper than printing, and the website would require minimal maintenance. Although the development of a website entails considerable initial costs, they would be offset over time.
Improving accessibility. Students unable to pick up a copy and those with visual impairments would be able to read the paper online.
Eco-friendlyness. A website would reduce paper use and not produce garbage.
Experience in digital media. For student journalists, gaining experience in managing a web-based news site would be invaluable for any work involving digital communication.
Inconvenient
One issue is information management. The site would have to comply with data protection and privacy laws. Advice should be sought from the IT department.
Another drawback may be personal preference. Twenty-five percent of respondents liked to have a physical newspaper in a coffee shop. However, since this is a minority view, I suggest that the benefits of the online document outweigh the drawbacks on this issue.
Conclusion
The results of the consultation suggest that moving the document online is the best option, as it would reduce costs, be more environmentally friendly and reach a wider audience. Therefore, a switch to a digital format is recommended to maintain the benefits of the newspaper while addressing its current difficulties.

"Work on the world's largest solar bridge has begun in central London.
The new solar roof covering Blackfriars Railway Bridge over the Thames River will cover more than 6,000 square meters when it is finished, according to developers.
More than 4,400 individual photovoltaic panels are expected to produce about 900,000 kilowatts per hour of electricity each year, providing the station with half its energy needs, according to Solar Century, the British company that installs the solar roof.
Annual CO2 emissions are also expected to decrease by more than 500 tonnes.
It is fantastic to see that this project finally comes to a successful conclusion. Blackfriars Bridge is an ideal place for solar energy, said Derry Newman, CEO of Solar Century, in a statement.
For people to see that solar energy is working is a vital step towards a clean energy future, he added.
Built in 1886, the railway bridge is being transformed as part of an update of Network Rail -- the owner and operator of the railway infrastructure in the UK -- to the existing Blackfriars station.
The Victorian railway bridge in Blackfriars is part of our railway history. Built in the era of steam, we are updating it with 21st century solar technology to create an iconic station for the city, Lindsay Vamplew, Project Manager for Network Rail for Blackfriars said in a statement.
In addition to the solar panels -LRB- manufactured by SANYO Electric Co. Ltd -RRB-, the station will also include rain capture systems and solar tubes for natural lighting.
The solar roof and the new station will be completed by summer 2012.

Subject matter: Questions relating to the process in the team

Dear Steve,
Since you asked me at our recent line management meeting to inform you of any problems, I am writing to tell you about a recent incident. Last week, after experiencing some difficulties with the order processing system, tensions arose in the equipment and there was a clash between two team members.
I have outlined what led to this incident as follows:
1. There was a system update we didn't expect last week. The update slightly changed the interface menu. Everything is still there, but people have said that it is not easy to find some of the menu items they are looking for.
2. There seems to have been a period of time after the update that the new entries were not being saved. This led to the loss of some work. We work overtime to catch up on everything and all orders have been processed. But as a result there was a general feeling of pressure and tiredness in the team.
As a result of these difficult circumstances there was some tension, leading to a disagreement between Johann and Mary. Johann lost his temper and made some inappropriate remarks to Mary.
I met with them to reflect and resolve the conflict. Johann has apologized for his behavior and realizes that Mary could have chosen to initiate disciplinary proceedings. They have worked together on a plan to improve communication and thus ease tensions within the team.
I have also asked our IT department colleagues to organize a training session for all of us on how best to use the system in the light of recent software updates.

"Shortly after visiting China for the first time in the fall of 1971, I saw a contingent of militia soldiers doing marching exercises in Tiananmen Square. I was told that they were rehearsing for the annual National Day parade on October 1, that people were eagerly waiting.
Mao Zedong proclaims the founding of the People's Republic of China in Beijing on October 1, 1949.
Weeks later, however, I was informed that the civil and military parade had been cancelled in the spirit of a simple and hard struggle, as President Mao decreed. The real reason: Lin Biao, then Defense Minister and Mao's anointed successor, would have died in a plane crash while trying to flee the country after a failed coup attempt.
China's achievements over the past 60 years have come in zigzags and zags. The best place to look back at what China has been through in the last six decades is Tiananmen, or the Gate of Heavenly Peace. Behind it is the Imperial Palace, or Forbidden City, where the emperors of China lived. The emperor is now history, but Tiananmen remains the political center of Beijing.
It was in Tiananmen's rostrum that President Mao formally proclaimed the foundation of the People's Republic. The Chinese people have risen! He declared with shrill Hungarian accent. For decades, the whole nation loyally followed Mao. He emphasized the political mobilization of the common man, especially the peasantry. In Mao's ideology, the Chinese people found hope in a New China, in which citizens would always have a bowl of rice to eat and clothing.
Mao proved to be good in the fight, but poor in government. He pushed for broad socio-economic initiatives and strident ideological campaigns, often with disastrous results. During two political campaigns in the late 1950s, more than 550,000 right-wing intellectuals were persecuted and imprisoned. The Great Leap Forward led to widespread famine and the death of some 30 million Chinese.
In the late 1960s, Mao again stood at the Tiananmen rostrum to launch the Cultural Revolution. There, he gathered hundreds of thousands of young Chinese -- the radical Red Guards -- who brought him in like a demi-god. It is justified to rebel! They proclaimed. They rebelled against everything and wreaked havoc everywhere. For ten years, China was condemned to political unrest and economic unrest. Perhaps the only factor that prevented the total collapse of the country was the incomparable resilience of the people and their ability to chi ku -LRB- eat bitterness, or endure difficulties -RRB-.
Mao's reign is also attributed to positive changes. It banned child brides and polygamy, built Beijing's first subway line, and launched a space program with the launch of China's first satellite. In 1972, the People's Republic of China replaced the Republic of China - LRB-Taiwan-RRB - at the United Nations.
However, for three decades under Mao, China tried to get out of its backwardness and isolation, but only achieved modest success.
Mao died in 1976 and his remains are preserved in a mausoleum in Tiananmen Square. Take an audio-visual tour of Mao's hometown
Soon, Deng Xiaoping became the new supreme leader. Deng revoked most of Mao's policies and embarked on reforming the economy and opening the country to the outside world.
Its quest for stability and prosperity took off in the early 1990s, driven by its pragmatic policies to attract foreign investment and build China's private sector.
Just south of Tiananmen, a landmark is a symbol of Deng's bold open-door policy. In the early 1980s, Kentucky's first exit Fried Chicken opened in Beijing, a stone's throw from Mao's mausoleum. Today, the fast food chain still does fast business, with a large portrait of the founder Colonel Sanders hanging in the three-story building.
Not all Chinese adopted Deng's policy of reform and open doors. The old guards and conservatives inside and outside the communist party accepted Deng's reform policies, but with a lot of distrust.
The reaction escalated in 1989, when Tiananmen witnessed an outpouring of support for students calling for freedom and democracy, and more reforms. After six weeks of intense demonstrations, the Tiananmen movement was brutally repressed. See iconic moments in China’s 60th anniversary
China has returned to world prominence through a 20-year economic boom, whose speed and breadth are unprecedented in human history. China moved from global economic irrelevance to the third largest economy in the world. The People's Liberation Army, which is no longer a scrap army, has emerged as a formidable military power capable of throwing a human being into space and tearing down satellites. Take a look inside China's space program
The People's Republic of China celebrates its 60th anniversary Thursday with 300,000 participants and 60 floats to highlight the country's achievements in various sectors of society and the economy. See the preparations for the anniversary in photos
A military parade will feature stepped troops marching along the Avenue of Eternal Peace. Modern military equipment -- tanks, armed personnel carriers, missiles, helicopters and combat aircraft, all manufactured in China, will be displayed. The fireworks will cover the festivities. See how China has changed over 60 years
But apart from pomp and spectacle, China’s extraordinary economic growth over the decades has led to unintended consequences: rising unemployment, growing income differences, endemic corruption, increased crime, environmental degradation and social unrest. Millions of Chinese live on less than $1 a day, and social tension sometimes turns into violent confrontations.
Chinese President Hu Jintao is pressing to promote democracy in the party, curb corruption and seek a harmonious society. To build a well-to-do society for 1.3 billion people and a democratic, civilized, harmonious and modernized country, he recently told a communist party meeting, China must firmly push reform and open up and follow its own path. Meet some of China’s Young Communists
Like the state-of-the-art CCTV tower that formally intended to open this year, but did not do so after a celebratory fireworks display went wrong and caused a fire, China’s great achievements remain alongside daunting challenges.

"What do you need to map a billion stars? A billion-pixel camera certainly helps.
Scientists hope to get more clues about the origin and evolution of the universe, and in particular our own galaxy, after a camera of this incredible scale -- adjusted to the Gaia space telescope -- was launched on Thursday.
Gaia, who retired from French Guiana, has been in charge of mapping the Milky Way in greater detail than ever before.
Designed and built by Astrium for the European Space Agency - LRB-ESA -RRB-, manufacturers say that the telescope is so sensitive that it could measure a person's miniature from the Moon, or to put it another way, detect the width of a human hair from 1,000 km -LRB- 620 miles -RRB- away.
The objective of the mission is to construct a three-dimensional image of our galaxy, measuring precise distances to one billion stars. Even this is a small fraction of the Milky Way, as astronomers believe there are at least 100 billion stars in our galaxy.
Tens of billions like Earth, study says
Astrium says that Gaia will also record a million quasars beyond the Milky Way, and a quarter of a million objects in our own solar system, including comets and asteroids.
You can do it with incredible precision. It is the largest camera ever put into space, said Ralph Cordey, head of science and exploration at Astrium.
He said that the spacecraft cost 400 million euros - LRB- 549 million dollars -RRB- to build, but the total cost of the mission would be 740 million euros -LRB- 1.020 million dollars -RRB- when it includes the costs of launching and carrying out the mission for its expected life span of five years.
If it succeeds, Gaia will join the knowledge gained from the NASA Hubble Space Telescope, which is still in operation, and the ESA Hipparcos satellite, which collected data until 1993.
Hubble stains the blue planet where it can rain glass
The value of putting a billion-pixel camera into space has been defended by Robert Massey of the Royal Astronomical Society of the United Kingdom.
Gaia is an amazingly ambitious mission, he said.
So far astronomers have relied on very indirect methods to measure the distance to all but the nearest stars, which means that the basis on which we build a map of the universe is surprisingly weak.
Based on the work of the pioneer satellite Hipparcos who mapped the stellar neighborhood in the 1990s, Gaia will be used to carry out works similar to the cartographers who inspected the Earth in the 19th and 20th centuries, building the first exact charts of the cosmos and helping us to better understand the structure, history and destiny of the galaxy in which we live.
One of Gaia's goals is to help in the search for exoplanets -- new worlds beyond our own solar system.
NASA's Kepler mission has so far confirmed the existence of 167 exoplanets with hundreds more being investigated, but Cordey anticipates that Gaia will probably discover thousands of new planets, while other missions will be able to discover more details about them.
In a recent interview with CNN, George Whitesides, CEO of Virgin Galactica -- the company that plans to take tourists into space -- said he thought that within a lifetime it would be possible to detect stations on distant worlds.
You may not have much time to wait, as Astrium is already working on design concepts to examine exoplanets atmospheres, which can provide signs of seasonal variations.
We're designing missions that could probably do that... it's not science fiction, Cordey said.

"Such is the fate of today's chemist: you expect ages for a new element to appear and then four come at once. Discovered by researchers from Japan, Russia and the United States, the four new elements are the first to be added to the periodic table since 2011, when elements 114 and 116 were included. The new elements, all spectacularly ephemeral and highly radioactive, complete the seventh row of the periodic table and make scientific textbooks worldwide obsolete.
The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the world organization governing chemical nomenclature, terminology and measurement, verified the elements on 30 December 2015 after studying the studies carried out in 2004. Scientists who found them now must present formal names to replace the clumsy Latin-based position markers –ununntrium, ununpentium, ununseptium and ununoctium – which reflect their atomic numbers, 113, 115, 117 and 118. The atomic number is the number of protons found in the atomic nucleus of an element.
IUPAC announced that a Russian-American team of scientists from the Joint Nuclear Research Institute in Dubna and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California had submitted sufficient evidence to claim the discovery of elements 115, 117 and 118. The agency gave credit for the discovery of element 113, which had also been claimed by the Russians and Americans, to a team of scientists from the RIKEN Institute in Japan. The decision means that Japan becomes the first Asian country to name an element. Under IUPAC rules, new elements can be named by mythological concepts, minerals, a place or country, or a scientist.
When formal names were assigned to elements 114 and 116 in 2012, scientists chose flerovium and liver, respectively, after the Flerov Laboratory at the Dubna Joint Research Institute and Lawrence Livermore Lab in the United States, where the elements were discovered. Kosuke Morita, who led the RIKEN investigation, said his team now planned to “look at the unexplored territory of element 119 and beyond.” Jan Reedijk, president of IUPAC’s Inorganic Chemistry Division, said: “The chemical community is eager to see its most appreciated table finally complete to the seventh row.”
It is believed that the Japanese team is considering three names for ununtrium: japonium, rikenium and nishinarium, after the Nishina Center for Science Based on Accelerater, where the element was found. “They’ll have been thinking about it for a while,” said Polly Arnold, a chemistry professor at Edinburgh University. “This is a laborious job. All this trying to understand Mother Nature helps us with our models and with the understanding of radioactive disintegration. If we understand this better, I hope that we can better deal with nuclear waste and the things that are important in the real world. It also leads to fantastic technological advances in the construction of the kit to make these observations.”
Along with new names, scientists must propose two-letter symbols for the elements. When IUPAC has received the suggestions from the researchers, they will be subject to public review for five months. That allows scientists and others to raise any objections. In 1996, the Cp symbol was proposed for copernicium, or element 112, but was changed to Cn when scientists complained that Cp referred to another substance.
To discover the elements, the researchers of the three laboratories struck the lighter nuclei among themselves and sought characteristic radioactive decays that should come from the new elements. Ununtrium and ununpentium are believed to be metals, while ununseptium could be a metalloid, a material that possesses some metallic properties. The fourth element, ununoctium, can be a noble gas, like other elements of group 18, helium, neon and argon. It's hard to know for sure because so few atoms of each element have been made.
Paul Karol, president of the IUPAC panel that verified the elements, said: “For now, most of the successes will be used by nuclear theorists to improve their understanding of the structure and stability of these very heavy cores while the experimenters seek the supposed but highly likely “island of stability” in or near element 120 or perhaps 126. Those elements may have enough lives to explore their detailed chemistry. The practical applications of the new elements, if any, are far away because of the difficulty in synthesis.”",C1
"The client next to you in the queue seems pretty innocent. But, instead of a shopping list, note that it carries handwritten notes about the appearance and cleanliness of the store. She's been timing the tail progression on her phone... and is that a small camera lens sticking out of her purse? The odds are you just saw a mystery buyer.
According to the Mystery Shopping Providers Association, approximately 50,000 mysterious shopping trips are made each month in the UK and, as online spending increases, the demand for mysterious buyers increases. “Detailers are increasingly aware that buyers who are willing to set foot in a physical store want a service and experience they cannot get online,” says Simon Boydell, Marketforce spokesperson, who has over 300,000 mysterious buyers in his books. “Our customers want to measure how well their stores are doing with that experience.”
“We assign different store locations to each buyer and rotate them so that they never return to the same store within three months,” says Jill Spencer of the mysterious shopping company ABa. “Every day, they usually spend up to eight hours visiting from five to ten stores, plus another hour or two filing detailed reports on each aspect of their visit.” For that, mystery buyers can earn up to £155 a day. They are also reimbursed for petrol and hotel stays, and are compensated for the depreciation of their car (buyers can be expected to drive up to 20,000 miles a year). Meanwhile, buyers of mysterious videos, filming their visits with a hidden camera placed in an eyelet or purse, can earn even more, about 300 pounds a day.
Buyers are usually reimbursed for any money they spend in stores and can also be allowed to keep the products they buy. “I’m usually given between £5 and £20 to spend on each store, to evaluate the service I receive in the box,” says Laura, a 50-year-old mystery buyer from Devon, who has been paid to visit about 7,000 stores since 2001. The purchase usually has to be related to a service or a type of product that the retailer wants her to check. “I’m always given a scenario, like buying something from a specific department or a new range of products, but, within that framework, I can often buy whatever I want – and keep it.”
Like most full-time mystery buyers, Laura works on her own, taking jobs from ABa and other mystery shopping companies like and when they appear. Your income is typically from £30,000 to £40,000 a year and that does not include all the gifts you get at work. “With the advantages, it’s enough to live. But I don't because I love shopping. In fact, I hate shopping now. When I’m not working, it hurts me to have to go out and buy a pint of milk.” She, however, finds it satisfying to go back to a store she had previously bought mystery and see that standards have improved. “I know it must be because of my comments or why would they pay me to give it to me? Some of the retailers I buy in winning prizes for customer service and I think that's up to us mysterious buyers. I feel like I’m not just doing a service to my company; I’m doing a service to all buyers everywhere.”
Sadly, the regular assignments of mysterious purchases they pay like Laura's are few and far away. In fact, the competition is so fierce, it keeps its work secret and even its friends and family do not know who it works for (Laura is not his real name).
It is estimated that more than 500,000 people have registered as mysterious buyers in the UK, but only 10% or less manage to get regular work every month and this has led to a dramatic reduction in compensation. “When once you have a fee, refund for your purchase and mileage, now you often only get a contribution for a purchase,” says Val, a 51-year-old mystery former buyer. “I worked for 40 different mystery shopping companies for nearly 20 years, but I completely quit three years ago because I had accounts to pay and very few assignments paid what I considered an acceptable fee.”
Today, mysterious shopping companies rely mainly on the promise of freebies to incentivize their workers. “Market buyers usually receive a couple of pounds for a visit as a symbolic gesture for their time and effort,” Boydell says. “At most, we will pay 15 to 25 pounds more reimbursement for, for example, a meal for two or a stay in a hotel. We do not directly employ any buyer so we do not have to pay them the minimum wage.”
“I would go on a cruise for nothing,” says Laura. “But I think mysterious shopping companies that pay you a nominal fee to travel to a restaurant and eat a meal are exploiting people. I won’t touch those jobs anymore.” However, there are many people who would. Hannah, a 41-year-old city attorney, has carried out nearly 500 visits to the Mystery Dining Company in her free time without receiving remuneration or travel expenses. As a prestigious “platinum diner”, it is regularly chosen by hand by the Mystery Dining Company to carry out its most exclusive tasks, enjoying 200 £ meals in Michelin starred Mayfair restaurants, five-star hospitality in Ascot and stays in boutique hotels.
But there is no such thing as a free lunch, even if you work for a mystery restaurant company. Hannah says it usually goes from two to four hours after each visit by writing detailed reports about everything, from the quality of food to specific interactions with staff, who always need to be able to name or describe “usefully.” More difficult of all, you must memorize all these details while eating – of course, you can't write openly anything.
“There is much to remember and sometimes it can downplay the experience. You are expected to give feedback while it is cool, so I had to get up at 5am to write a report before working. It’s a difficult thing to do; you need to be focused, articulated and detail-oriented.”

"As colorful fish swam next to him off the Greek coast, Cathal Redmond was convinced that he had taken some great pictures with his first underwater camera. But when he looked at the results on dry ground, the images were brown and cloudy. After taking the photos while holding his breath underwater, he blamed the limited time he had to prepare the shots. All he needed, the industrial designer thought, was a little more time to properly capture the fish in their natural environment.
He swore to make the little extra time he needed come true and the result is his invention of the Express Diving – a rechargeable air storage device, kept in his mouth, which allows users to swim underwater for two minutes. Its goal is to bridge the gap between snorkeling, with its limited scope, and diving, which gives divers the freedom to breathe underwater, but at the cost of using cumbersome and expensive equipment. The prototype of the invention, which is still in the initial stages of testing individual parts, looks like a crossing between a dive nozzle and a water bottle.
“I wanted to let people do more. So, instead of getting under the water and spending 30 seconds holding my breath, I wanted to do a little more than they could do,” says Redmond, 27. In 2006, the Irish designer completed a diving course and loved the feeling of being able to breathe underwater and observe fish in their natural surroundings. However, less pleasant were the fins, the weight belt, the neoprene suit, the air tank, the mask and all the rest of the equipment.
“I was well aware of the fact that I had about 50 kg tied to me and getting into the water was quite strange when you’re used to trying to stay on the surface. It was a very surreal experience,” he says. “The real problem is that it is very limiting in terms of what you can do. Although it allows you to stay underwater longer, you have to plan your entire day around it. You have 20 kg to 50 kg of equipment with you - you can't be walking on the beach and decide you want to enter. Planning is a very important part of it. It takes a lot. There is a lot of re-learning required.”
It was during a senior project for his degree in product design at Limerick University that Redmond produced the Express Dive. The device has two main parts. When above the surface, the unit uses a ventilator to vacuum air through a vent in the nozzle. The air, accelerated around the motorized turbine, is compressed through a series of valves and stored in the connected tank, which has a green blinking display light when it is full. When the air no longer enters, the vent goes out and, as the user dives, the air feeds through the nozzle.
That screen, which is in the user's eye, then acts as a health bar turning from green to red when the air runs out. The device can take enough air for two minutes of diving and takes about the same amount of time to be recharged. “When you put the compressor in the unit with all the rest of the stuff, batteries and electronics and membranes for the delivery of diving, the big trick was to be able to get small enough so that it could be held through the teeth and out of the mouth,” says Redmond.
Electrics are protected from housing water and recharged by inductive energy transfer – a system that uses an electromagnetic field, similar to pads that can wirelessly charge mobile phones, so there is no need for exposed cables.
Redmond says the nozzle feels similar to using a snorkel. It compares it to an extension of the lungs in which the user is taking a deep breath and then using it underwater. “It’s an extension of the body’s ability to store air,” he says. The prototype, made of high density foam, aluminum and silicone, has been tested in parts. Redmond says he has shown that the engine can compress two minutes of air in the unit and that the design can be effectively maintained in the mouth of the diver. What he hasn't done yet is test the device in a diver, completely submerged for two minutes. But, with enough evidence, Redmond is confident that he can get a fully functional device that doesn't endanger swimmers underwater.
Redmond recently arrived as runner-up of the International James Dyson Award, which will give him £5,000 to develop the project. The first indications are that the device would have a price of £280, he says, and is likely to weigh between 1kg and 3kg depending on the necessary safety features.
For anyone who thinks that two minutes of air is just a small improvement in snorkeling, Redmond says he could make all the difference underwater. The typical swimmer can hold his breath for about 40 seconds while under water, he says. “Two minutes isn’t much time, but it’s much longer than that,” he says.

"One of the most influential figures in human history is Charles Darwin. Darwin has been called the father of evolution for his work in evolutionary science. In the United States, Darwin has become the symbol for atheists in the country, as his theory of evolution strikes against creationism. His theory states that all species on Earth have descended from their ancestors, and have adapted to their surroundings throughout history. He also claims that each species has a common ancestor. Darwin introduced his theory in his historical book on the origin of species in 1859.

His book was received with suspicion from both the scientific community and the general public, but by the 1870s, his work was beginning to gain massive acceptance. One of his most significant studies arrived when he sailed with the HMS Beagle, a British maritime vessel, to the Galapagos Islands. The islands have long been isolated from the South American continent, providing a unique vision of the evolution process.
While sailing from island to island, Darwin noticed similarities between island species and continental species. Most were similar in many ways, but some had subtle differences. He also found that the same species differed from island to island. For Darwin it was clear that the reason for the slight differences was the individual environment of each island. These islands showed Darwin the process of evolution in the process of elaboration.
Darwin has many critics of religious circles. A very famous Darwin cartoon depicting him as a half-human monkey was published in 1871 in response to his theory that humans evolved from monkey-like creatures. It spawned a movement of non-believers called Darwinism, which includes people who feel that their theories are rooted in the scientific method rather than religious dogma.",C1

"“There are certainly drug addicts MOOC, who take them for no other reason that they are not free and like to leave,” smiles Dr. Ben Brabon of Edgehill University, whose massive open-line course on vampire fiction is one of the two accredited MOOCs currently offered in the UK. Brabon is not denigrating people who enroll in MOOC courses: he is simply pointing out the motivation that drives certain people to enroll. When a course is open – MOOCs do not have enrollment criteria and do not have to pay fees – then participants will behave very differently from students in a traditional higher education environment.
MOOCs are the newest in the search to allow higher education for all. A large amount of venture capital is being invested in emerging online platforms, which allow the delivery of increasingly sophisticated and interactive course content to participants who can count on hundreds to tens of thousands. For these investors, the Holy Grail is to find a business model for MOOCs that makes them profitable – so far, the courses have depended on universities being prepared to finance the curriculum design of their star teachers and the time of online teaching. Extracting captured data on how, why and when millions of participants choose to enroll, interact with their material, send their tasks, communicate, and leave the course can be a way to get a return on investment.
However, part of the dilemma surrounding the direction the MOOCs will take in the future is that no one can define who they are intended to benefit exactly. Universities eager to attract international students who pay fees to postgraduate courses showing their best programs online? Are students in developing countries hungry for access to first world universities? Do employees want to develop their professional knowledge? People who lack qualifications and want to use MOOCs as a bridge to higher education? Or amateur students, who are interested in learning about a thematic area in which they have an interest?
Although they may be popular to start with, MOOCs have extreme termination rates, notes Brabon. For his vampire fiction course, that meant 1,000 inscriptions and 31 endings. “And almost all of them had a first degree or had been educated at grade level,” he says. “So the MOOC trend may not be opening up to sectors of the population that have not yet reached.”
“Learning online is a different thing, it needs quite advanced learning skills,” confirms David Kernohan, program manager for eLearning Innovation at Jisc, a charity that advocates the use of digital technologies in education and research in the UK. “With MOOCs, there is very little support available: the student drops off and tends not to receive any individual attention. While this may mean that online study is unattractive or difficult for someone without high-level qualifications, yes, he says, he suggests that MOOCs could be “a very good tool for continuing education.”
At a time when the number of part-time students has fallen sharply as the price of a degree increases, could this kind of open and open-access courses provide a new path to university education? Could a full degree be taught through MOOCs? “I don’t think MOOCs work that way,” says Brabon. Instead, he suggests “a mixed approach that combines a university experience with a MOOC; also, perhaps, the use of MOOCs to create a global degree, with students taking courses from all over the world, might be possible.”
But that's a bit in the future: for now, no future employer will worry a lot if you are shaking your MOOC completion certificate, without any quality assurance in the course content or your evaluation standards. Therefore, accreditation is now the central challenge for MOOCs to gain credibility with academics and employers, says Brabon, who is part of a Quality Assurance Agency working group, with the aim of developing an agreed approach to standards and marking.
There is idealism around the MOOC concept that brings the best of first world teaching to students from less developed countries. But there is also cynicism, with the suggestion that universities could use MOOCs to advertise their products on campus to a greater number of lucrative – though certainly not always wealthy – students from outside the EU.
Mike Sharples, president of Educational Technology, doesn't swallow that cynicism. MOOCs are seen primarily as a way to show and share the best teaching talent in universities, as well as encourage interaction and solicit feedback from students around the world, he says. He believes that recruiting international students in university courses is just a secondary goal of directing MOOCs – although they could certainly be a very canny marketing movement, as he notes that “if 20,000 people enroll in a MOOC – well, it only takes 20 of them to enroll later to lead a master’s degree.”
Meanwhile, any politically correct doubts about whether UK academic institutions are condescending with developing countries exporting small fragments of elitist education can soon be totally irrelevant, warns Matthew Poyiadgi, managing director of Pearson VUE. ""I think we can come to a situation in the future where universities may have no choice, and where British universities are saying, ""If we don't have a presence in China, then we'll be left behind,"" he says.
“In South America, China, countries in Africa, there is a huge appetite to learn and some of the best courses in the world are offered online,” Sharples adds. “If people are truly fascinated by learning, then why not? The real challenge is to allow these countries not only to consume and study MOOCs, but also to create them.”

"Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was hospitalized on Sunday after doctors discovered a blood clot during a follow-up test related to a concussion she suffered this month, her spokesman said.
She is expected to stay at the Presbyterian Hospital in New York for the next 48 hours so that doctors can monitor her condition and treat her with anticoagulants, said Philippe Reines, Undersecretary of State.
Your doctors will continue to assess your condition, including other problems associated with your concussion, Reines said. They will determine whether further action is necessary.
Reines didn't specify where the clot was discovered.
Clinton, 65, suffered from a stomach virus earlier this month when she fainted due to dehydration, causing concussion.
Clinton spent the holidays with her family last week after working from home.
She was scheduled to return to work at the State Department this week after she had been marginalized for the past three weeks. Her illness forced her to withdraw from testifying on December 20 to the House Foreign Affairs Committee about the deadly attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Deputies Thomas Nides and Bill Burns appeared in their place.
The medical setback occurs when Clinton is finishing his busy term as Secretary of State, during which he has recorded more than 400 days of travel and nearly a million miles. He plans to leave office when the Senate confirms President Barack Obama's decision to replace her.

"The Moroccan city of Ouarzazate is used for large productions. On the edge of the Sahara Desert and in the center of the North African film industry “Ouallywood”, it has hosted large budget shots in Lawrence of Arabia, The Mummy, The Living Daylights and even Game of Thrones.
Now, the commercial city, nicknamed the “desert gate”, is the place for another blockbuster – a four-mega-connected solar plant complex, which, along with hydroelectric and wind power, will help provide almost half of Morocco’s electricity from renewable energy by 2020 with, it is expected, some spare to export to Europe. The project is a key point in Morocco's ambitions to use its unexploited deserts to become a global solar superpower.
When the entire complex is complete, it will be the largest concentrated solar power plant in the world and the first phase, called Noor 1, will become operational in November 2015. The mirror technology it uses is less widespread and more expensive than photovoltaic panels that are now familiar on roofs around the world, but will have the advantage of being able to continue producing energy even after the sun sets.
The solar energy potential of the desert has been known for decades. In the days following the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986, German particle physicist Gerhard Knies estimated that the deserts of the world receive enough energy in a few hours to meet the energy needs of mankind for a whole year. However, the challenge has been to capture that energy and transport it to the population centres where it is needed.
While engineers give the final touches to Noor 1, their 500,000 crescent-shaped solar mirrors shine across the desert horizon. The 800 rows follow the sun as it travels through the skies, buzzing silently every few minutes as its shadows slide further east.
When they are finished, the four plants of Ouarzazate will occupy a space as large as Rabat, the capital of Morocco, and will generate 580 megawatts (MW) of electricity, enough to feed a million homes. Noor 1 has a generating capacity of 160MW.
Morocco's Minister of the Environment, Hakima el-Haite, believes that solar energy could have the same impact on the region in this century as oil production in the last. But the $9 billion project to make your country's desert boom was triggered by more immediate concerns, he said.
“We are not oil producers. We import 94% of our energy as fossil fuels from abroad and that has great consequences for our state budget,” el-Haite told The Guardian. “We also used to subsidize fossil fuels, which have a high cost, so when we found out about the potential of solar energy, we thought, 'Why not? '""
Solar energy will account for one third of Morocco's renewable energy supply by 2020, with wind and hydropower in the same proportion.
“We are very proud of this project,” said el-Haite. “I think it’s the most important solar plant in the world.”
Each parabolic mirror is 12 meters high and focuses on a steel pipe that carries a ""heat transfer solution"" (HTF) that is heated to 393C as snakes along the channel before rolling into a heat engine. There, it mixes with water to create steam that rotates power generating turbines.
The HTF consists of a synthetic thermal oil solution that is pumped into a heat tank containing molten sands that can store thermal energy for three hours, allowing the plant to feed homes at night. Mirrors are spaced in level formations to minimize the damage of sand blown by desert winds.
Technicians say plants Noor 2 and 3, which will open in 2017, will store energy for up to eight hours, opening the perspective of 24/7 solar energy in the Sahara and surrounding region.
“The biggest challenge we faced was to be able to finish the project in time with the level of performance we needed to achieve,” said Rashid al-Bayad, the project director.
But, despite the fact that the first phase of the project is about to be completed, Morocco is observing great international ambitions. “We are already involved in high-voltage transport lines to cover the entire south of Morocco and Mauritania as a first step,” says Ahmed Baroudi, manager of the Société d’Investissements Energéticas, the national renewable energy investment company. But he says the final impact of the project will be much broader, even in the Middle East. The ultimate goal given by His Majesty the King is Mecca.
It remains to be seen whether this ambition is achieved, but the export of solar energy could have stabilizing effects within and among countries, according to the Moroccan solar energy agency (Masen). Discussions are under way with Tunisia and energy exports to the north throughout the Mediterranean remain a key objective.
“We believe it is possible to export energy to Europe but, first, we would have to build the interconnectors that do not yet exist,” said Maha el-Kadiri, Masen’s spokesperson. “Specifically, we would have to build interconnections, which would not go through the existing one in Spain, and then start exporting.”
Spain itself has banned new solar projects due to the lack of interconnectors to transmit energy to France. The EU has set itself the objective of ensuring that 10% of energy from each Member State can be transported abroad by cable by 2020.
In the meantime, Morocco focuses on using solar energy to meet its own resource independence needs. One day, this could include desalination of water, in a country that is increasingly affected by drought as the climate warms up. Officials are well aware of the functioning they are implementing in what is the most advanced renewable energy programme in the Middle East and North Africa region. “We are at the forefront of solar energy,” says el-Kadiri.
About $9 billion has been invested in the Noor Complex, much of it coming from international institutions such as the European Investment Bank and the World Bank and backed by guarantees from the Moroccan government. Undisclosed energy subsidies from Morocco's unelected ruler, King Mohammed VI, have prevented the cost from being transferred to energy consumers.
A month before the launch, more than a thousand workers, mostly Moroccans, continue to run to fix electrical cables, demolish scaffolding and wrap rock wool insulation around steel pipes. They pass busy in yellow and orange bibs, working 12-hour shifts on a backdrop of the Atlas Mountains. Harnesses with hammers and gloves tied to their belts swing from their sides. ubiquitous hard hats, security shoes and ear plugs give the scene a theatrical camp air.
For Hajar Lakhael, a 25-year-old security and environment manager from Meknes, rehearsals are almost finished and blockbuster production is almost ready for action.
“We’ve done the construction and, now, we’ll see what these projects look like when they start,” he says. “It’s exactly like preparing for a great performance.”
A global audience will be watching with interest.

"More than a million British workers could be employed on zero-hour contracts, new figures reveal, suggesting that British companies are using controversial employment terms much more widely than previously thought.
The figure – derived from a survey of more than 1,000 employers by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) – prompted new calls for the government to launch a full investigation into the use of contracts, after a week in which a number of organizations – from retail chains to Buckingham Palace – have been criticized for hiring staff but do not offer job and pay guarantees every week. Employees on zero-hour contracts often do not receive vacations or sick pay and have to apply for leave before seeking additional work elsewhere. The ICPD found that 38% of zero-hour contract workers describe themselves as full-time employees, usually working 30 hours or more a week. One third of employers in the voluntary sector use contracts and one in four public sector organizations.
The latest issues also cast doubt on the accuracy of official data on the subject. The National Statistical Office has increased its estimate of the number of workers in the United Kingdom from zero hours by 25 per cent to about 250,000.
Peter Cheese, the executive director of the ICPD, said: “It is necessary to examine more closely what a zero-hour contract means, the different forms it takes and clearer guidance on what good and bad practices are like in its use. And this must take into account both the advantages and disadvantages in practice for companies and employees.”
Retailer Sports Direct recently became the focus of controversy in zero hours when it emerged that the company employs about 20,000 of its 23,000 employees in contracts. The use of the contracts by the retailer was followed by details of a number of other companies using the offers, including the film chain Cineworld and Buckingham Palace, which uses them for their 350 summer workers.
The J D Wetherspoon Pub Group has 24,000 employees (80 per cent of its staff) on established terms.
Vidhya Alakeson of the Resolution Foundation, an independent think tank, added: “If it is true that there are about a million people on zero-hour contracts, then that would be a substantial part of the workforce – this could no longer be ruled out as a problem affecting only a small minority.
“The new estimate underlines the urgent need for a thorough and thorough review of zero hours by the government, taking into account not only the magnitude of the problem, but also the impact these contracts have on workers’ labour rights, earning capacity and personal well-being.”
Trade unions and anti-poverty groups have accused employers of pressuring staff to sign contracts in order to evade their responsibilities and reduce staff benefits.
Dave Prentis of the Unison union said: “The vast majority of workers only have these contracts because they have no choice. They can give flexibility to a few, but the balance of power favors employers and makes it difficult for workers to complain.”
Workers on zero-hour contracts are often only told how many hours they go to work when weekly or monthly shifts are made, but are expected to be on call for additional work in a short time. They must be entitled to holiday payments based on the number of hours they work, but they do not qualify for sickness benefit.
The National Trust charity, which employs many of its seasonal workers on zero-hour contracts, said it offered the same salary and benefits to those prorated workers as full-time staff, but needed some workers to be in a more flexible arrangement.
“We believe that zero-hour contracts are essential in our organization, as we depend a lot on the weather,” said a spokesperson. “Our properties have told us that it is important to be able to reorganize staff shifts quickly to respond to time and zero-hour contracts allow us to do this.”
Politist Chuka Umunna said contracts should be the exception to the rule. “While some employees welcome the flexibility of such contracts, for many, zero-hour contracts leave them insecure and insecure of when the job will come,” he said.
Some people have argued that the flexibility of zero-hour contracts may have allowed the UK to avoid higher levels of unemployment during the economic recession, while ICPD research suggests that only 16% of those with zero-hour contracts report that their employer often does not provide them with enough hours each week.
The Institute ' s figures also suggest that 17 per cent of private sector employers used zero-hour contracts, significantly less than 34 per cent of voluntary sector organizations and 24 per cent of the public sector.
The industries in which employers were most likely to report at least one person on a zero-hour contract were hotels, restaurants and leisure (48 per cent), education (35 per cent) and health care (27 per cent).

"Wales will become the first country in the UK where people will be presumed to have given their consent to have their organs donated unless they choose not to.
The Welsh Assembly has voted for the adoption of the voluntary exclusion policy, which will allow hospitals to act on the assumption that people who die want to donate unless they have specifically registered an objection.
The final stage of a bill to approve a system of presumed consent was adopted by 43 votes to 8, with 2 abstentions, despite objections by religious groups on moral grounds and concerns that the plan might add to the distress of grieving families.
“This is a great day for Wales, for decentralization and, more importantly, for the 226 people in Wales waiting for an organ transplant,” said Wales Health Minister Mark Drakeford.
“I am proud that Wales is the first nation in the UK to take this step. As a society, we have shown that we are ready to take steps to increase organ donation and give hope to people who expect a transplant every week.
“Family denial is an important factor affecting the number of organ donations and the main reason for the refusal is the lack of knowledge of your loved one’s wishes.
“The family of the potential donor has an important role to play in organ donation. The aim of the bill has always been to respect the wishes of the deceased; however, family members or friends may object to consent being considered to be based on what they know about the opinions of the deceased.
“When family members know that organ donation is what the deceased would have wanted, they usually agree to participate in the donation process. The new law will work by clarifying people's wishes on the issue of organ donation and, in turn, increasing the rate of consent to donation.
“Today is a historic day for Wales and I hope the rest of the UK is watching with great interest when legislation is implemented in 2015.”
The issue is controversial, and opponents are concerned that the pressing need for more kidneys and hearts will lead to the wishes of those who have died and that their family will be nullified. But ministers insist that there will be safeguards.
Inevitably, some people do not come close to registering their opposition. In response to concerns, the government recently announced that families would play a more important role.
Family members must have a “clear right of objection”, giving them the opportunity to prove that the deceased would not have wanted to be an organ donor.
Wales has acted because of an acute shortage of organs. “We have the permanent problem of not having enough organs for people who need them,” Drakeford said. “Almost one person dies every week in Wales while on a waiting list. We've been working to improve the organ donation rate and we've had some success, but we're looking to take the next step forward.
“Around one third of the Welsh population is on the organ donor registry, but more than two thirds in the polls say they are happy to be organ donors. That other third are the people who don't come up with their names. We hope to make progress on that.”
The new law would apply to any person over the age of 18 who has lived in Wales at least one year before his or her death. The donated organs would go not only to people who need a transplant in Wales, but to anyone in the UK.
The doctors are delighted with the move. The British Medical Association has long campaigned for a system of voluntary exclusion due to its concern over the growing number of people in need of transplants as a result of medical progress in transplantation.
The number of young donors decreased significantly when the seatbelt legislation came into force. In recent years, great efforts have been made to increase the number of people carrying an organ donation card, with great success. Hospitals have also introduced improved systems for coordinating transplants, including crucial discussions with family members when there is no indication of the wishes of the deceased. But the increase in the number of organs harvested is still not enough.
Some religious groups, on the other hand, strongly oppose the plan, arguing that it would cause further distress to the failing relatives. Members of the Muslim Council of Wales and the Council of Jewish Representatives of South Wales have expressed reservations, while the Archbishop of Wales, Barry Morgan, said that “donation must be a gift of love, of generosity. If organs can be taken unless someone has explicitly registered an objection, that is not an expression of love. It is more a medical use of a body.”

"Male bosses are being paid bonuses that double the size of those given to female partners in identical positions, a disparity that means that men enjoy a wage increase of £141,500 more than women throughout their working life.
The figures, published by the Chartered Management Institute (CMI), reveal that men in managerial positions in the United Kingdom earned average premiums of £6,442 in 2012, compared to £3,029 for women. In the highest positions, female directors received premiums of £36,270 over the past 12 months, compared with £63,700 for male directors.
The latest figures highlighting the inequity of remuneration in British companies led to calls for action by activists for equality in the workplace. Ann Francke, executive director of CMI, said: “It’s time to move this issue to the top management agenda.
“It’s about changing our management approach to allow for greater flexibility, fewer male cultures, more emphasis on results rather than office time, and greater transparency around performance and rewards. “In resolving this issue, we actually raise the performance of organizations and the well-being of people at work. What are we waiting for?” added Dr. Ruth Sealy, senior researcher at the Cranfield School of Management: “It’s not surprising. Bonuses are a method of payment that can be used with discretion. As for what needs to be done in this regard, these things must be made more transparent.”
While statisticians warned that some of the data may be skewed by factors such as women entering occupations where there is less bond pay culture, discrepancies in the size of awards seem to aggravate Britain's pay gap, which the government says is closing, but still sees full-time male employees earn 10% more than women.
Maria Miller, Minister of Women and Equality, said: “The CMI figures are another harmful example that highlights that, in the world of work, women continue to lose to their male counterparts and that the playing field is far from leveled. “The changes in the workplace are happening and it is good that the pay gap is closing, but much remains to be done before we see full equality in the workplace.
“The government is playing its part: we have outlawed wage secrecy clauses, given the courts the power to force employers who violate wage equality laws to conduct wage equality audits and signed 120 companies up to our Think, Act, Report plan, which encourages businesses to improve the way they hire, promote and pay women. “We have also examined other causes of wage gap, such as having to juggle work and family responsibilities, introducing shared parental leave and the right to apply for flexible work from all employees.”
Large companies such as Tesco, BT, Unilever and the international law firm Eversheds are among those registered in Think, Act, Report. The plan has attracted only 120 supporters in almost two years of existence, with an increase of 54 participants in November 2012. However, the CMI data did provide some evidence to support Miller's claim that the overall wage gap is narrowing: the difference between the average wages of male and female chiefs appears to have decreased, from an average of £10,060 in 2012 to £8,502 in the most recent CMI figures. However, the institute warned against direct comparisons between the 2012 and 2013 samples – which polled around 40,000 managers – as they are not identical.
A subset of 17,000 individual managers, whose salaries and bonuses have been followed over several years, showed that the income of male managers is increasing faster than that of women for the first time in five years, and men enjoy total increases of 3.2 per cent compared to 2.8 per cent for women when wages and premiums are combined.
At the highest level, the income of male directors increased by 5.3 per cent in the last 12 months, compared with only 1.1 per cent for female directors.

"With a list of star customers including Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lindsay Lohan, Julia Roberts and Michelle Pfeiffer, Trelise Cooper is an internationally known fashion designer.
Starting with a boutique shop in Auckland, New Zealand, in the mid-1980s, Cooper's rise to the fashion stage -- and the cover of Vogue and Marie Claire -- is made more remarkable by the fact that he never received any formal training as a designer or seamstress.
Instead, Cooper relied on his self-confessed obsession with detail as well as a natural eye for fashion. I was born a fashion designer, she says, and shortly after setting up a shop, her clothes acquired a reputation for their bold use of patterns and intricate seams.
Cooper took on the challenge of Fusion Journey to travel from New Zealand to New Delhi, the capital of India. Although it is a city he had been on business many times before, he says he had never been allowed to study his traditional dress seriously.
See more Merging trips
There he was commissioned to create a new fashion line that would combine his own sophisticated modern style with the vibrant colorful traditions of Indian sewing.
In his own words, Cooper takes up the steps of his Fusion journey.
Trelise Cooper: I love the historical aspect of clothing. My ranges are full of influences from 19th century French, English, even vintage American styles. So I'm not surprised you've always enjoyed combing flea markets in small towns and finding rare old jewelry to steal some inspiration.
I am also obsessed with details, so when I find a Victorian dress or a fifties wedding slip that I like, then it is important for me to be able to emulate the exact sewing, embroidery or beads used at that time. In the West, unfortunately, most of our expert hand-sewing traditions have been lost; the skills have not been passed on and the sewing geniuses of Europe's sewing houses have not been replaced.
That's why I often travel to India. It is one of the best places in the world to find that experience continues to thrive. From one village to another there are whole families, generations, who have their own specialities of stitch work.
Honestly, I can give you any old historical piece I've found and either you'll take it and recreate it almost perfectly, or you'll say hmmm... I don't know this seam, but I know a nearby place that does. It's a fashion designer's dream!
So in a sense, I've been merging my clothes with Indian influences for a while. However, I think this was the first time I traveled to India with the conscious intention of creating a fusion of styles: his own traditional dress with my most modern and western creations.
I love the color and vitality that is India. New Delhi is exciting and chaotic and noisy and dusty and smoked and hot. Everything is so full of intense color and I realized that, on a subconscious level at least, I have been influenced by the Indian style... In fact, when it comes to the bold use of colors and the use of these rich and deep dyes, how can anyone deny India's enormous influence on fashion all over the world?
Walking through the streets, you see combinations of colors that you would never imagine would work. I remember a beautiful woman wearing a bright and radiant rose sari mixed with a lime green print. I mean lime and rose! It sounds elegant, but in it, with the quality of the dye and the way in which the colors had been combined it looked absolutely impressive.
We made our way to a store that I can only describe as a treasure of fabrics and other treats. This was the place to find all the accessories, textiles, ribbons, bows, buttons, and beads that I could take back to my studio in Auckland to use as inspiration for the final creations.
There were ideas there, old and new, that I had never thought about. I could already imagine opportunities to use all kinds of different laces and braids, detailed examples of hand seams, with some other old dresses that we had collected from a local supplier.
As much as I love them personally, I don't sell things like saris -- and I never would -- it's not a style that attracts the tastes of my particular customers. However, what I brought back to New Zealand was its techniques, its intense colors of celebration, its embellishments details, its expert use of beads and sequins.
I worked on the new line for many months, and these are the elements that I hope I have succeeded in incorporating into them. I think they've added an opulence, an affair. But I'll only know that I've finished the creative process when someone comes in and says, whatever happens, they have to have it.
The garment carries them on a journey, and so my journey with the garment is over.

"David Mitchell, a regular contender for the Man Booker literary prize, is used to his novels that are chosen by critics. Therefore, it is a relief, says the British author, that his last work – finished at 1:00 a.m. on Tuesday before a car arrived to take him to the airport to take a flight to Norway – is not seen by anyone until 2114.
Mitchell is the second contributor to the Future Library project of Scottish artist Katie Paterson, for which 1,000 trees were planted in 2014 in the Nordmarka forest of Oslo. Starting with Margaret Atwood, who delivered the manuscript of a text called Scribbler Moon in 2015, each year for the next 100 years, an author will deliver a piece of writing that will only be read in 2114, when the trees are cut to make paper on which the 100 texts will be printed.
Each author – his names revealed year after year and chosen by a panel of experts and Paterson, while alive – will walk to the place in the high forest over Oslo, where they will deliver their manuscripts in a brief ceremony.
“It’s a little ray of hope in a season of highly depressing news cycles, which claims we’re on a civilizational opportunity in a hundred years,” Mitchell said. “Everything tells us that we are doomed, but the Library of the Future is a candidate on the ballot for possible futures. It brings hope that we will be more resilient than we think: that we will be here, that there will be trees, that there will be books and readers, and civilization.”
Mitchell said he found writing the book “very liberating because I will not be around to take the consequences of whether this is good or bad... But, I am interspersed between Margaret Atwood and certainly some other brilliant writer. So it better be good. What a historical fool of age proportions I would look at if it were opened in 2114 and not good.”
Usually, says Mitchell, who was shortlisted for the Man Booker for his 9dream and Cloud Atlas novels, he “pulsed and polished” his writing. “Actually, I exaggerate. But, this was very different – I wrote down the cable. Therefore, the first two thirds were polished and the last third had no time. And it was a liberation.”
The future creator of the Library, Paterson, whose past works have involved her mapping of dead stars and the compilation of a slide archive of the history of darkness over the centuries, asked writers to address “the theme of imagination and time, which they can take in so many directions.” Mitchell revealed only the name of the manuscript, From Me Flows What You Call Time, during a ceremony in the Norwegian forest next to where the 1,000 Paterson trees are planted. The title is taken from a musical piece by Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu but, apart from admitting that “it is something more substantial than I expected,” the author would say nothing.
Delivering his text in the forest, protected from intermittent rain by an umbrella and amidst the shoots of 1,000 high pines, Mitchell read his wet audience of children and adults a short story and William Wordsworth's dream made my spiritual seal. Its end, “Round rolling in the daytime course of the earth / With rocks, stones, and trees”, felt appropriate in this small section of forest, carpeted with blueberry bushes, which will be carefully attended by the next 98 years before it becomes manuscripts of the Library of the Future.
“How vain to suppose that the doodles of the little old self will be of lasting interest to future generations. However, how discreet and discreet, to enslave upon a manuscript for which no one is going to pat you on the back and say, ‘Good ’ or ‘ God, I loved how little she did that and he did this... ’” Mitchell wrote in a piece for the Library of the Future.
Your manuscript, now handed over, will be sealed and placed next to Atwood’s in a wooden-covered room in Oslo’s new public library, which will open in 2019. Watched by a trust of experts until it is finally printed, it is now, says the novelist, “it has disappeared from me like a coin that fell into a river.”

"Four positive books about the world
Reality – Hans Rosling with Ola Rosling and Anna Rosling Rönnlund
Actually, Professor Hans Rosling, along with two collaborators, asks simple questions about the world. Questions like ""How many girls finish school?"" and ""What percentage of the world's population is poor?"" It turns out that most of us have the answers to these completely wrong questions. Why is this happening? Reality aims to explain why, showing that there are several instincts that humans have to distort our perspective.
For example, most people divide the world into US and ELLOS. Besides, we often think things are getting worse. And we're consuming large amounts of media that use a sales model based on making us afraid.
But according to the authors, the world is not as bad as we think. Yes, there are real concerns. But we must adopt a mindset of factfulness – just bring opinions that are supported by strong facts. This book does not address the underlying reasons for poverty or progress, or what needs to be done on these issues. It focuses on our instinctive prejudices, offering practical advice to help us see the good and the bad in the world.

Lighting now – Steven Pinker
Do things get worse every day? Is progress an impossible goal? In Illustration Now, Steven Pinker looks at the overall picture of human progress and finds good news. We live longer, healthier, freer and happier lives.
Pinker asks us to stop paying so much attention to negative headlines and news that they declare the end of the world. Instead, it shows us some carefully selected data. In 75 striking graphics, we see that security, peace, knowledge and health are improving all over the world. However, when the evidence does not support his argument, he dismisses it. Economic inequality, he says, is not really a problem, because in reality it is not so important for human well-being. One cannot help but wonder how many people actually living in poverty would agree.
The real problem, Pinker argues, is that the values of the Enlightenment of Reason and Science are under attack. When commentators and demagogues appeal to tribalism, fatalism and people's distrust, then we run the risk of causing irreparable damage to important institutions such as democracy and global cooperation.

The Rational Optimist – Matt Ridley
For more than 200 years pessimists have been winning the public debate. They tell us things are getting worse. But in fact, life is improving. Income, food availability and service life are increasing; diseases, violence and infant mortality are declining. These trends are happening all over the world. Africa is slowly emerging from poverty, just like Asia before. The Internet, mobile phones and world trade are greatly improving the lives of millions of people.
The best-selling author Matt Ridley not only explains how things are improving; he also gives us reasons why. It shows us how human culture evolves in a positive direction thanks to the exchange of ideas and specialization. This bold book analyzes all human history, from the Stone Age to the 21st century, and changes the notion that everything is going downhill. The glass is half full.

The Great Surgeon – Steven Radelet
Most people believe that developing countries are in a terrible situation: they suffer from incredible poverty, ruled by dictators and with little hope for significant change. But, surprisingly, this is far from the truth. The reality is that a great transformation is taking place. Over the past 20 years, more than 700 million people have increased their incomes and emerged from poverty. In addition, six million fewer children die each year from disease, millions more girls attend school and millions of people have access to safe drinking water.
This is happening in developing countries around the world. The end of the Cold War, the development of new technologies and courageous leadership have helped to improve the lives of hundreds of millions of people in poor countries.
The Great Wave describes how all this is happening and, more importantly, shows us how we can speed up the process.",C1

"Two weeks after the end of the U.S. government and, days before a possible breach, President Barack Obama has made one last attempt to restore credibility to the world's largest economy.
By proposing Janet Yellen as president of the powerful Federal Reserve, the president has tried to calm the markets that have already been affected by Washington D.C. disputes.
Do investors care if Yellen is a woman? Of course not, I hear you crying. What they care about is whether you're going to print more cheap money and keep rates low.
The most powerful woman you've ever heard of
But apart from her immediate inclinations in quantitative easing, Yellen's nomination is an important milestone for women's representation in the world of monetary policy.
Why? Because for the first time a woman is being entrusted with the value not only of any currency but of the most important reserve and trading currency in the world.
Their actions will affect the lives of millions of people in the country and abroad, giving patriarchal societies a pause to reflect.

Women may not be allowed to vote in Saudi Arabia, for example, but the country's main export, oil, has a price of dollars. Men can dominate the financial sector, but for the next four years they will have to hold on to every word of a woman.
However influential it may be, Yellen cuts a solitary figure in the global central bank organization chart, especially in Europe, where both the ECB and the Bank of England are currently devoid of female power at the top of the tree.
A superficial look at the Central Bank Board shows that only 12 of the world's 160 central banks had women governors last year. That's about 6%. Such figures would not be acceptable on the board of your mid-list company.
Last year, 15% of the directors of FTSE 100 companies were women, while the EU is pushing for management boards to increase that quota to 40% by the end of the decade.

Yellen is not an ordinary woman or economist. She is an extraordinarily experienced and trusted pair of hands that faces a formidable task ahead of her in trying to wean the world's five-year money markets basically for free.
But by raising it to the helm, the Federal Reserve joins an unfortunately short list of national banks with governors that includes countries not exactly influential such as Belarus, the Kyrgyz Republic and Samoa.
Although her appointment has yet to be approved, Yellen's promotion will make her the second most powerful person in the United States.
If women can take on such a large position as that, it is surely time for them to have more voice in the clubby world of monetary policy.

"A suspected leader of the Juárez drug cartel told the authorities that he had ordered the death of some 1,500 people, a Mexican federal police official said on Sunday.
Federal police detailed charges against José Antonio Acosta Hernández, known as El Diego, a day after authorities announced his arrest. He was one of the most wanted criminals in the country, with officials offering a reward of 15 million pesos - LRB- $1.3 million -RRB- for his arrest.
Collaboration with the U.S. Drug Administration led to the arrest of Acosta, said Eduardo Pequeno, head of the Mexican federal police anti-drug unit.
Acosta is accused of being a leader of the drug gang known as La Linea, the application arm of the Juarez cartel, the Mexican authorities have said.
Pequeno told journalists that Acosta said he ordered the murder of some 1,500 people, mostly in Ciudad Juárez and the capital of Chihuahua.
An investigation points to Acosta as the brain behind the murder of three people related to the U.S. Consulate in Juarez, Pequeno said.
More recently, Acosta ordered operatives to hang banners with threatening messages addressed to the DEA and other U.S. authorities, Pequeno said.
Juárez, Mexico's most violent city, shares a border with El Paso, Texas.
Pequeno also accused Acosta of having connections to some of the most notorious acts of violence in the border city over the past two years, including the murder in 2010 of a state prosecutor, a car bomb outside a police station, and a massacre at a party that killed 15 people, most of them students with no links to organized crime.
Acosta told the authorities that the targets of his criminal organization were police, government officials, rival drug gangs and civilians, Pequeno told reporters.
Earlier this month, the U.S. consulate in Juárez issued a statement warning U.S. citizens to remain vigilant based on information they had received that cartels could attack the consulate or entry points on the U.S.-Mexico border.
The northwest of the Mexican state of Chihuahua, which contains the capital, as well as Juárez, has been a breeding ground for drug-related violence.
The federal government has been attacking cartel operations, and especially its leaders, in an ongoing battle.
Mexican authorities have arrested several others accused of being related to the murder of three persons related to the consulate last year.
The shootings occurred on March 13, 2010, when consulate employee Lesley Enriquez and her husband Arthur Redelfs were shot to death as they left a birthday party in their white SUV.
Jorge Alberto Salcido Cinderos, husband of another consulate employee, was killed in a separate vehicle.

"Unveiling the complex stories of the more than 200 pardons issued by the former governor of Mississippi. Haley Barbour is revealing serious questions about how the pardon review decisions were carried out.
But maybe no forgiveness is as confusing as the case of Harry Bostick. The pardon of the retired Internal Revenue Service investigator has been called atrocious by Barbour critics.
Someone did not do their homework on this case, said Democratic State representative Steve Holland.
When Barbour pardoned Bostick in January, the DUI convict was sitting in a cell in Oxford, Mississippi, for violating the terms of an earlier DUI sentence and was awaiting formal charges of another drunk driving accident in October that ended in the tragic death of 18-year-old Charity Smith. Who is to blame in that accident has not yet been determined.
Okolona's teenager, Mississippi, had great dreams of saving money and going to college to get a degree in business. The young woman's death and the controversy surrounding the case have devastated Linda Smith, Charity's mother.
She should still be here with me. She should still be here with me. This shouldn't have happened, Linda Smith told CNN during a two-hour emotional interview.
Bostick was pardoned for a serious crime of drunk driving dating back to March 2009. That crime was Bostick's third drunk driver's arrest in just over a year.
The Mississippi and Barbour Parole Board have issued statements saying they didn't know Bostick had another DUI arrest in October. He arrived after his pardon case had already been reviewed.
Oxford Police Sergeant. Hildon Sessums arrested Bostick twice for a one-year DUI period.
Just before I put the handcuffs on him, he said, ""Don't do this to me.""And my comment to that usually is, you did it to yourself, Sessums told CNN as he related details of the two arrests.
By the third DUI, Bostick had been sentenced in March 2010 to one year's house arrest and four years in the Mississippi drug court program, an intensive drug and alcohol abuse treatment program with strict guidelines that convicted offenders like Bostick must follow.
Bostick was still going through the drug court program when he started applying for a pardon last summer. High profile friends wrote letters to Barbour promoting what they called Bostick's genuine lifestyle change.
The letters detail what friends described as Bostick's slide into alcoholism after the tragic death of his teenage son in a strange fire in the house and after Bostick's divorce, according to documents of pardon and parole obtained by CNN.
One letter said that Bostick no longer drinks alcohol and has changed his life.
Harry Bostick has led a tragic life. A life that has now been changed by a grace that is greater than he. Now it can be a positive factor in many lives, wrote retired US attorney Jim Greenlee.
On September 30, the Mississippi Parole Board sent its review of the Bostick case to Barbour. The board recommended Bostick for a full pardon with a split vote of 3-2.
About a week later, on October 7, Bostick drove under the influence again, according to the Mississippi Highway Patrol. Charity Smith tried to get off a highway just outside Tupelo when Bostick's truck crashed into one side of his car.
Charity Smith was murdered and her older sister suffered serious injuries.
Bostick has not yet been charged by a grand jury in that accident. Because his third DUI was pardoned, a conviction in DUI's last case would technically be his third offense, but that would make him a felony in Mississippi.
The Mississippi and Barbour Parole Board are at a loss to explain how Bostick's forgiveness could have developed the way he did. State officials say there is no mechanism to alert them to situations like this.
A Department of Corrections spokesman referred all questions about the case to the Mississippi Parole Board.
Bostickspardon application package sent from the Parole Board to the governor's office is full of references to the accelerated investigation into the circumstances surrounding Bostick's crime, i.e. his third DUI of 2009.
According to a state prison official, the accelerated rush was the result of a flood of pardon requests as the clock was counting towards the end of Haley Barbour's term as governor.
Barbour rejected CNN's request for an interview, but its spokesman, Laura Hipp, issued a statement.
In reviewing Mr. Bostick's case, the governor. Barbour took into consideration the recommendation of the Parole Board, and was not aware of subsequent charges, he said.
Shannon Warnock, president of the Mississippi Parole Board, issued a statement saying: I can say that Mr.Bostick's request was supported by testimonies from reliable and prominent members of the community. While the reported circumstances of such detention are worrying, our justice system considers everyone innocent until proven guilty.
Linda Smith, Charity's mother, worries that her teenage daughter's death has been forgotten in all of this. She struggles to understand how state officials could not have known that the man involved in her daughter's violent accident was the same Harry Bostick who had applied for a pardon.
It was a person. She wasn't just a name on a piece of paper. “A beautiful person,” Linda Smith said.
His days are now spent crying over his daughter's death.
She cried during most of her interview with CNN while showing pictures of the beautiful girl with great dreams.
Linda Smith described her daughter as an artist with a great heart, and proudly spoke of the powerful emotions she feels holding a collection of her daughter's paintings.
One of the paintings was a gift from Charity Smith to her mother. Instead of signing the painting, Charity left her handprint on the back.
But perhaps the most touching painting was of rotating blue and purple and orange that says life is short.
The girl with the artist's heart now laments for her mother with her heart broken.

"It could be the best thing since Trevor Baylis's radio on the pre-internet of 1990, a cheap light that takes energy out of gravity and could end the use of dangerous kerosene-powered lamps in Africa and India.
But when British designer Patrick Hunt went through the conventional bank or venture capital route to get his invention started commercially, he had a problem. “We’re trying to get funds to make this happen, but it’s slow and complex and untested and nobody wants to take a risk,” he said.
So he tried crowdfunding on an American website, Indiegogo, which had recently opened in the UK. In five days, he had reached his goal and raised £36,200. So popular was his campaign in late 2012 to attract donations from the public that in 40 days he had raised a colossal £400,000.
LED light is powered by a dynamo driven by the descent of a bag of 10 kg of rocks. The weight is attached to the light, raised to a height of about 2m, and while it is allowed to fall slowly to the ground it will generate enough energy for half an hour of light.
Hunt is preparing for production in China and will test the market again by delivering 1,000 of the lights to Africa before full mass production of what he expects to be millions of units.
He is one of a new wave of entrepreneurs turning to the fast-growing crowdfunding industry for finance. Another new site is InvestingZone, which combines rich individuals with start-up entrepreneurs.
Indiegogo does not offer actions, but it allows users to offer “perks” for different levels of donation – those who help fund Hunt’s innovative light not only have to feel good to help the less rich, but also have their own light.
For Danae Rigelmann, co-founder of Indiegogo, “gravity light” is a perfect example of how meritocratic crowdfunding can be and how it can test an entrepreneur’s idea. “It’s the first time that finance has been fast, efficient and meritocratic, because it’s not about ‘How can I have access to decision makers in that bank?’ or 'Who do I know on that venture capital team?' This is all about proving your worth to your customers and fans, getting them to validate your idea and fund it.
“Even ideas that aren’t considered worthy of funding are worth trying, because you’ve saved a lot of time to find out that it wasn’t a good idea and be smarter faster,” he says.
United States-based Rigelmann began his career as a Wall Street analyst. In 2008, she decided to give up and use her skills to try to help friends working in the arts raise money.
The site originally focused on the film business and was launched at the Sundance Film Festival that year.
Five years later and is raising about $2 million a week for new businesses in stages of creation and growth. In December 2012, he launched a euro and a pound sterling service to get a foothold on this side of the Atlantic and says Britain is his third largest market. International activity has increased by 41 per cent since December.
There is no shortage of competitors, be it Kickstarter, Seeds or Financing Circle, but, unlike rivals, says Rigelmann, Indiegogo is the only crowdfunder where anyone can launch a campaign. No project is considered too crazy.
The site charges a 4% fee for successful campaigns. For those who fail to increase their target amount, users have the option of returning all the money to their taxpayers free of charge or keeping all the money raised but with a 9% fee.
A British woman, Lauren Pears, raised £100,000 to open a “cat cafe” in London through the site.
Known as Lady Dinah’s Cat Emporium, it has not yet been opened, but it is counted as a place where people can “enter from the cold into a comfortable backchair, a cup of hot tea, a book and a cat.”
“We’ve seen campaigns that go to venture capitalists to be rejected because the kids at risk say, ‘Great idea but I don’t know if the market really wants it; it could be a gadget that nobody cares about,’” said Rigelmann.
“Employers make an Indiegogo campaign – they don’t even launch the project, but the campaign itself is enough market evidence for venture capitalists to say that there is a market for this.
“It allows you to test your market, test your prices, test your features, discover new revenue streams, get vital feedback,” says Rigelmann.
With his background on Wall Street and the experience of helping 100,000 companies and services raise funds, Rigelmann has fine-tuned his advice for the budding entrepreneur.
“Ideas is ten cents per dozen. It's about execution and, if you're afraid that your idea will be stolen by someone who could execute it better and faster than you, then you're not the right person to execute that idea. It’s all about trust to move fast and learn,” he says.
For Rigelmann, the expansion to Europe and an agreement with a web transaction provider, which will allow payments to be made through local card services such as Master in the UK and Carte Bleue in France, as well as PayPal, are part of a dream to democratize finance. More than 7,000 funding campaigns are live on the site.
While crowdfunding as an alternative to banks has grown, it has a limited appeal to big business investors, who are content with nothing less than a stake in a promising business. This could begin to change in the UK with the launch of InvestingZone.

"It's not over in Steubenville, Ohio.
Although a judge has found two teenagers in Steubenville guilty of raping a 16-year-old girl in a case that showed amazing examples of teen alcohol consumption and texting wrapped in cover-up charges, the Ohio Attorney General said Monday is time for a grand jury to see if anyone else should be charged.
I think the Steubenville community really needs two things. One is to end this, Attorney General Mike DeWine said in a wink at the frustration that the ongoing investigation is likely to cause in the city -- a small city of Ohio River Mill that has been the focus of intense criticism and media coverage for months.
But the other is to believe that justice has been done, that we have left no stone unturned and that anyone who is criminally responsible has been brought to justice, he said.
The healing process after rape never ends
The victim's mother told CNN that the verdicts are the beginning of a new start for my daughter. But he added, “We need to emphasize the importance of helping those in need and defending what is right.
“We hope that something good will emerge from this,” he said. I feel like I have the opportunity to make others known, possibly change a young person's mentality, or help a father become more aware of where his children are and what they are doing. Adults must take responsibility and guide these children.
But the emotions inflamed by the case echoed last Sunday's verdict, with sheriff's deputies and state investigators arresting two teenagers on Monday for threatening the victim on Twitter. The girls -- a 15, a 16, both from Steubenville -- were in a youth dungeon on Monday night, waiting for a judge to appear Tuesday morning, Jefferson County Sheriff Fred Abdalla said.
Grand jury
DeWine said state researchers have examined tens of thousands of text messages, images and videos and talked to 56 witnesses, ranging from teenagers attending the parties to assistant football coaches and the high school principal.
But 16 people who may know something about what happened that night in August have refused to talk, he said.
I have come to the conclusion that this investigation cannot be completed -- that we cannot end this matter -- without the convening of a grand jury, he said in a statement on Sunday.
The grand jury will begin to meet around April 15 and could take several days to complete its work, DeWine said.
And I must point out that convening a grand jury, of course, does not necessarily mean that the charges will be returned or that charges will be brought, he said.
A grand jury is a unique investigative tool to ensure fairness and to complete this investigation, DeWine said in Sunday's statement. And this community needs assurance that no stone has been left unmoved in our quest for truth.
Guilty sentences
The Grand Jury's DeWine announcement came shortly after Judge Thomas Lipps found Trent Mays, 17, and 16-year-old Ma lik Richmond, guilty of rape. Lipps, who was listening to the case without a jury, also found Mays guilty of spreading a nude photo of a minor.
Authorities accused Mays and Richmond of sticking their fingers into the girl's vagina while she was too drunk to consent, an act that constitutes rape under Ohio law. The incident took place during a series of alcohol-fed end-of-summer parties in August.
Some of the abuses were documented in photographs shown in court and in texts read aloud during testimony, including a text in which a state forensic investigator testified that Mays wrote, should have violated as everyone believes I did.
The essay focuses on text messages
Lipps sentenced Mays to a minimum of two years in a juvenile correctional facility. Richmond received a minimum of one year. The juvenile authorities may decide to hold both detainees until they reach the age of 21.
Richmond's father, Nathaniel Richmond, said he still believed his son was innocent even though he apologized in court.
The evidence they had against Ma Lik was minimal, he told Piers Morgan of CNN tonight. Ma Lik was in the wrong place at the wrong time. I know my son isn't a rapist, even though he's been convicted of rape.
Both Mays and Richmond must undergo treatment and they will have to register as sex offenders, Lipps said. Richmond's attorney, Walter Madison, said his client would appeal in an attempt to avoid that designation.
Meanwhile, the victim and her family remain under surveillance after the threats were posted online, Abdalla told CNN.
She's still a victim and victimized... over and over again, she said. And that's the sad part.
One of the tweets that led to Monday's arrests warned that if the poster saw the victim, it's gone, it's a homicide. Another threatened a beating.
The girl accused of tweeting the death threat surrendered after learning that the investigators were looking for her, the sheriff said. However, they will have to answer her, she said.
“We are dealing with children again,” Abdalla said. But the Attorney General had just left the building -- the judge was still in the building -- when I received messages that there were already death threats against the victim.
No charges had been announced against the suspects on Monday night, but there's no doubt they're going to prosecute.
I hope this sends a warning, he said. And I can assure you, we've been monitoring Twitter for 24 hours and we're still doing it. If there's anyone else there who crosses a line and makes a death threat, they're going to have to face the consequences.
Internet atrocity
The case received much attention after a blogger who once lived in Steubenville discovered some of the materials published on social media.
Blogger Alexandria Goddard wrote clearly about the possibility that teenagers would have been given preferential treatment because they played in the city's prestigious football team. The police have denied that claim.
Later, the freely organized group of hackers Anonymous became involved, posting a long video in which another teenager -- who has not been charged -- made jokeal references to rape.
The anger that followed on the case attracted national attention and criticism of the city throughout the country, leaving city officials struggling to defend the community and residents tired of media attention.
Teenage Rape Trial Shines in Ohio City
Wider problem
Recognizing the frustration of the city, DeWine said Monday that it would be a mistake to focus on a small community in Ohio, thinking that something unique in their culture is behind the incident.
“I’m afraid people are going to leave and say that all this was for Steubenville,” DeWine said. It's not. It's a cultural problem.
I guarantee you that there are very similar crimes to this that happen every Friday night and every Saturday night in communities across this country where there are people, particularly young people, who are drinking too much and a girl is taken advantage of, and a girl is raped, he said.
Such incidents have their origin in a broader social problem, a lack of respect and unbridled human decency, he said.
One of the lessons of life is that we have to take care of each other, and we have to try to help people and we have to do the right thing. DeWine said. And there were very few people that night who were doing the right thing.
Teenagers treat the girl like a toy, says the prosecutor
CNN's Poppy Harlow, Brian Vitagliano, Yon Pomrenze, Matt Smith, Steve Almasy and Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.

"Gang rape and the murder of a young woman in New Delhi in December has raised awareness in India in a way she has never experienced before: it has forced Indians to face a terrible truth that for our girls and women, violence and discrimination are facts of everyday life, an epidemic that, according to researchers, nearly 2 million lives are claimed in India every year.
But now the real work begins for each of us who take to the streets in protest. How do we channel the energy of these manifestations into real solutions for our communities?
Earlier this month I tried the challenge, when officials from the Barabanki district of Uttar Pradesh, a state adjacent to New Delhi, asked me if I would run a workshop to promote adolescent safety and gender sensitivity in government schools.
I was disappointed to see that they had invited only the principals of the girls' schools. So I agreed on one condition: that district school principals also attend. Because if there's one thing I'm sure is that all the candlelight vigils, the passion and the protests will be in vain if we don't figure out how to make men and boys part of this growing movement to transform gender relations in my country.
For more than a decade I have worked for the poverty group CARE as a community educator on health and gender issues. I have seen how deep inequalities between women and men trap millions of Indian families in the cycle of poverty. But along the way, I have also met countless men who, given the opportunity, were willing to examine and improve their behavior towards girls and women in their lives.
The fact is that most people want what is best for their loved ones. Aggressive behavior towards women is not innate. It is learned and may not be learned. When asked to reflect on their attitudes towards women's education, sharing domestic chores, having girls and even violence, the boys and men with whom I work every day can and change.
It often starts with something simple, like laundry.
I think of Ram, a man I worked with in the village of Pavaiya Viran. A husband and a father with a male job -- drilling underground bombs -- Ram attended sessions where he was given the opportunity to analyze gender roles in his life. He understood that men and boys are under pressure to express power and that when they feel weak or frustrated, their intestinal reaction is often to show power, even if that means violent or abusive behavior.
Ram finally adopted a new view; that truly strong men do not show power, show care. “Let the other men laugh at me for cooking and washing clothes,” he told me. Why should my wife do all things alone?
Now I'm not saying men doing laundry is the solution. But every time he folds the sheets, Ram shows his children that he respects his wife and treats her as an equal, not a servile.
So I kept thinking about Ram as I met with the group of 53 school principals for boys and girls earlier this month. We are concerned with the importance of installing security cameras on the school doors, ensuring that a driver is on every school bus, and having clean and functioning bathrooms in schools so that girls and boys are not forced to go out and ease themselves. All this was necessary. But it looked like we were playing defense. Only when educators were forced to hold a mirror to their own lives, did it feel like we were playing the offensive, too.
Many recognized that it is their duty as parents and community leaders to lead the next generation by example. A director realized that he had not even considered doing household chores, not as a child or, now, as a husband and a father. Another promised to make gender equity a necessary part of parent-teacher conferences. At the end of the session, every man and woman in the room was thinking of changing not only others, but also himself or herself.
We have a long way to go, and not just in India. A World Health Organization global survey revealed that 59 per cent of rural women in Ethiopia report sexual violence by their partner, 62 per cent of women in Peru report physical violence by their partners, and 30 per cent of rural women in Bangladesh claim that their first sexual experience was forced. The problem is also not limited to the developing world. Almost one in five women in the United States had been raped or had been subjected to attempted rape.
Still, I am confident that the Indian people can demonstrate to the world that we are not powerless in the face of any global epidemic. We can change. That begins by treating this moment not as a global issue of our dirty clothes, but rather as a national awakening to the reality that all of us -- girls and boys, women and men -- must do our part in cleaning up.

"Edward Dolman is Christie's first executive director who has been a specialist, who understands the pressure and nature of valuing art. Part of your mission is to attract other highly motivated specialists in your business.
Christie's employee is next to a painting at Christie's auction house in London on July 4.
Dolman was born in London in 1960 and attended Dulwich College between 1971 and 1978, before studying Art History at the University of Southampton.
He later graduated from the Centre for Studies of Fine Arts and Decorative Arts, which had a close relationship with the Victoria and Albert Museum.
Not being born of blue blood, he joined Christie's because of the link with Christie's South Kensington, starting as a doorman in the furniture department.
After a year he took on the role of a specialist in the furniture department of South Kensington, where he would see everything, from European furniture to Chinese furniture, in the large sales room for the next 10 years.
Meanwhile, he became an auctioneer, making a series of off-site sales on rural farms and traveling to France and Belgium to generate business in the middle furniture market.
At that time he was on the Management Committee, and South Kensington started making big sales. Finally, in 1995, he decided to become a manager and took a course at the Institute of Directors at the Mall to learn the language of business and the motivation of people.
Dolman was later appointed CEO of Christie's Amsterdam, applying new techniques and marketing to increase interest in high-quality art.
Twenty months later he returned to Christie's London on King Street as commercial director to lead Christie's Europe. In trying to develop new categories to win business, he was appointed Director General.
In 1999 Dolman moved to New York as International Managing Director and later as Chief Executive. Together with Christie's International Management Group, they developed a five-year intensive business plan, and Dolman took over Christopher Davidge, approved by Francois Pinault.

"As soon as children in a primary school in Stirling hear the words “daily mile,” they lower their pencils and leave the classroom to start running around the school camp. For three and a half years, all students at St Ninian’s Primary have walked or run a mile each day. They do it randomly during the day, apparently happy, and, despite the increase in childhood obesity throughout the UK, none of the school children are overweight.
The daily mile has done so much to improve the physical condition, behavior and concentration of these children in classes that dozens of nursery and primary schools across Britain are following suit and getting students to get up from their desks and take 15 minutes to walk or run around the school or the local park.
Elaine Wyllie, director of St. Ninian, said: “I receive at least two daily emails from other schools and local authorities asking how we do it. The idea of children running around the country every day for something we have done is phenomenal.”
One in ten children is obese when they start school at the age of four or five, according to figures from the Center for Health Information and Social Assistance, and in the summer of 2015 a study found that schoolchildren in England are the least fit they have had. Therefore, primary schools have quickly taken note of the benefits of the daily mile. It has been introduced in schools in London, Gateshead, Wales and other parts of Scotland, while others are planning to launch the initiative during the 2015-6 academic year. Only in Stirling, 30 schools have already started or are going to start the daily mile.
“It is a common sense approach to children’s fitness, which is free and easy. The most important thing is that children really enjoy it; otherwise, it could not be sustained. They come back with bright eyes and pink eyes, how the children looked. It’s good to see,” Wyllie said. At St Ninian’s, teachers take their students out of class to a specially constructed circuit around the school’s playing field for their daily mile when it best suits that day’s schedule. Only the ice or the heavy rain stop them.
The extent of the benefits has not yet been determined, but researchers at Stirling University have started a comparative study to look for quantitative evidence of the physical, cognitive and emotional benefits of the daily mile. Dr. Colin Moran, who leads the study, said: “The children of St. Ninian do not seem to have problems with obesity; they seem happier and the staff says they settle in lessons faster, so we designed a study that would test all these things. There is a lot of anecdotal evidence about the benefits, but there is still no scientific data.” The students of San Niniano will be compared to the children of another Stirling school that has not yet started the plan.
Kevin Clelland, a primary school teacher at Leeds, visited St Ninian before convincing his colleagues that it was a great idea. He said: “It’s such a simple thing to do, but it seems to have such an amazing impact. We are truly committed to improving the fitness of our students beyond the two statutory hours we are expected to meet.” Your school is now building a track.
Active Cheshire, a strategic body for sport and fitness in Cheshire and Warrington, is taking a group of senior local authority figures to Scotland to evaluate the results of the daily mile. The hope is to introduce it into the 450 schools in the region if a pilot succeeds.
Paralympian, Tanni Grey-Thompson, president of ukactive, the UK’s leading non-profit health agency for physical activity, said: “All children need to reach 60 active minutes every day, whether in a lesson, on a walk to school or in the playground. It is fantastic to see initiatives such as the established daily mile, showing true leadership from the education sector to improve the physical fitness levels of children and their cognitive behavior, and to make a real difference for schools, teachers, parents and young people. We know that sitting still kills; not sitting still helps children develop skills that will remain with them for life.”
The Scottish government also supports. One spokesman said: “Learning in physical education is enhanced by initiatives such as the daily mile, which can encourage and support parents to foster healthy habits with their children from an early age. We are pleased to see that many Scottish schools participate or plan to do so.”

"Protests broke out across Northern Ireland on Friday against the decision of Belfast City Council members to stop flying the Union flag all year round.
Most of the protests were peaceful, although the road network in Belfast and across the country was disrupted, police said in a statement.
One of the most serious incidents occurred on O'Neil's Road in Newtownabbey, where about 100 protesters, many of them teenagers, threw concrete blocks, paving slabs, bricks, wooden planks, petrol bombs and Molotov cocktails at the police.
They targeted about 30 armoured police vehicles and up to 100 police officers dressed in riot gear. At least one officer looked hurt. His head bowed, the officer was helped by the comrades.
In the midst of rain and temperatures above freezing, the police brought two water cannons, deploying one of them to push back the troublemakers. The police were trying to get control of a main road.
In Images: Flag Protests in Northern Ireland
In total, four police officers were injured, one of whom required hospital treatment, and two people were arrested, the police said. During the demonstrations, 33 petrol bombs were thrown at the police, after which all roads were reopened.
The eruptions occurred after two nights of calm that followed five consecutive nights of riots.
Belfast has been at the centre of a wave of protests brought about by the City Council decision of 3 December to limit the wave of the flag to 18 days a year.
The disorder has resulted in more than 100 arrests and 66 officers have been injured.
The flag was raised on Wednesday for the first time since the controversial vote to commemorate the birthday of Prince William's wife, Catherine. It was lowered at the end of the day.
The leaders of the two main trade union political parties met on Thursday to discuss concerns within the trade union community.
The Northern Ireland authorities have accused loyal extremists of exploiting the Belfast officials' decision to put an end to the centuries-old tradition of flying the Union flag over the City Hall 365 days a year.
The British flag has long been a flash point between loyal British and Irish nationalists, who want Northern Ireland to join the Irish republic.
The Belfast City Council vote followed a summer of intense tensions between the Catholic and Protestant communities in Northern Ireland. The September riots left dozens of police officers injured.
Most of Ireland gained independence in 1921 after two years of conflict. But six of the nine counties in Ulster province chose to remain in the UK, eventually becoming Northern Ireland.
Police: extremist group orchestrating violence in Belfast by the union Jack
In the late 1960s, the conflict between the main loyal Protestants, who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, and Roman Catholic nationalists, who want it to meet with the rest of Ireland, broke out in a political and sectarian war, known as problems.
The three decades of violence that followed between loyalists and the IRA claimed more than 3,000 lives, most of them north of the border. While the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, also known as the Belfast Agreement, effectively ended the conflict, mistrust between Catholics and Protestants persists.
Under the terms of the agreement, groups on both sides dropped their weapons, and members of Sinn Fein, the political affiliate of the IRA, now work with pro-British politicians in the power-sharing Northern Ireland government.

"Your manager stops you and says you need to have a word about your performance in the recent project. You worry all weekend, wondering what you've done wrong. When you enter her office on Monday morning, she starts by praising you for the good work you've done on the project, and you wonder if this is the obligatory praise that begins with the typical ""feedback sandwich"". You know how the comment sandwich goes: say something nice, say what you really want to say, say something nice again.
In an attempt to inject some positivity into your feedback, many managers rely on negative feedback between two positive feedbacks. However, when feedback becomes a routine, employees can begin to perceive positive feedback as simply a way to sweeten negative feedback, thus decreasing its value. Instead, positive feedback should not simply be seen as something to cushion the negative, but should be delivered to reinforce and promote good performance. Below are three tips to help you make positive feedback count.
1. Do not always follow positive feedback with negative feedback
When positive and negative feedback always seems to go hand in hand, positive feedback can be devalued and ignored. Make sure there are times when positive feedback is given for itself and resists the temptation to offer constructive criticism.
2. Cultivating a ""growth mentality""
Carol Dweck, a psychologist and advocate of ""growth mentality,"" spoke of the plasticity of the brain and of our ability to develop skills and talents that we might not have been good at. Many of us tend to focus our praises on the end result and seemingly innate talents, for example. 'You really have an eye for details' or 'You have a real talent for organizing events'. However, research suggests that if we focus on the process of how things are done – praising effort, experimentation, and problem-solving strategies – we can foster the development of new skills and the continuous improvement of talents.
3. Create a culture of positive feedback
Make positive feedback part of your team/department/company culture. Don't expect special moments like evaluations to give feedback. Offer informal positive feedback by making a little chat or walking down a hallway. Feedback doesn't just have to come from the higher ranks either. Encourage peer feedback among team members and colleagues and actively ask them for positive feedback on each other's actions in the tasks.
It may take time to counteract the effects of an environment in which there is a cynical view of positive feedback, but in the long term, by adopting positive feedback, you can not only improve job performance, but also enrich the quality of life in the workplace.",C1
"On a dry, dusty football field, the boys squealed and screamed like children in the middle of a highly competitive football match often do.
One neighborhood resident pointed at three other guys on their bikes outside the side view.
See where they are? That's where the cars would stop, he told me. They'd take a man out and execute him. Some days it was more than one.
Just a few years ago, this same football field was an Al Qaeda extermination camp where, like a clock every day before evening prayers, executions were carried out, and the young people -- the same ages as those who now play football in front of us -- gathered to see the macabre event, seemingly immune to the horrors they were witnessing.
That was in February, when we were in Iraq filming stories for the tenth anniversary of the beginning of the Iraq war. In April, I found out that a couple of the guys we filmed died in a bombing on the road. The bomb -- containing 2 kilograms of highly explosive material -- was hidden in a plastic bag, placed outside a three-story building that had a popular ice cream shop on the first floor. The boys were there.
This is the tragic rule of Iraq by which the people are forced to live. The violence few understand, the fear that permeates all aspects of life, where even a simple action such as leading children to eat ice cream can result in death.
Last year there was a marked increase in attacks, especially coordinated simultaneous attacks, a trademark of ISI -- the Islamic State of Iraq -- a coordinating organization that includes Al Qaeda in Iraq.
Baghdad is a maze of blast walls and checkpoints, with Iraqi security forces strengthening security, but barely achieving anything but creating increasingly frustrating traffic jams. The government promotes cases in which it has managed to spread bombs, but the harsh reality is that they simply cannot stop the violence.
July was the deadliest month in Iraq in the last five years since the peak of sectarian violence in 2006 and 2007. According to the UN, 1,057 Iraqis were killed and 2,326 others injured in acts of terrorism and violence last month.
And on Saturday the bombings from Nassiriya in the south to Baghdad to Mosul in the north claimed dozens of lives and wounded nearly two hundred more. It was Eid, the three-day feast marking the end of the sacred month of Ramadan.
Most of the explosions exploded in predominantly Shia areas, in cafes, markets and bus stops.
Where are the security forces? A man at one of the bomb sites asked angry. If you -- Prime Minister Maliki -- can't take care of security, someone else will!
The anger and frustration among Iraqis are bleakly palpable.
The Islamic State of Iraq claimed responsibility in a statement, saying that violence was intended to be a message to the animals of Rawafdh Shiite and his government.
Al Qaeda in Iraq—LRB-AQI-RRB—was once described by the U.S. military before withdrawing from Iraq in 2011 as a flight. But it is clearly no longer the case.
To begin with, Iraq's security forces were never able to contain the security gains of the U.S. military era.
The AQI and other Sunni extremist groups have capitalized on the failure of the predominantly Shiite government to introduce Sunnis into the political fold. The Sunni population in Iraq claims that it is being systematically attacked by government forces and becomes more alienated and stripped of its rights by the day. Iraq remains a nation where violence and politics go hand in hand.
AQI has also expanded its operations to Syria under the umbrella of Al Qaeda in Iraq and the Levant – LRB – Syria –RRB. His head, which passes by the pseudonym Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi or Abu Dua'a, among others, is believed to be mainly operating from Syria.
But the resurgence of Al Qaeda and its operations are only part of the messy and vicious patchwork of forces that govern this part of the world at the expense of the civilian population and that plunged into an existential battle that began millennia ago.
These forces include the regional struggle that confronts Shiite Iran against Saudi Arabia and Sunni Qatar -- a regional power that has found indirect battlefields in Syria and Iraq -- along with Russia and the United States.
The fates of Iraq and Syria are increasingly intertwined day by day, and it is civilians who always remain victims of this lethal network of dynamics over which they have little control.

"An Alaskan judge has denied Bristol Palin's petition for his court to fight with ex-boyfriend Levi Johnston over his son's custody to avoid a media circus.
The daughter of the former governor of Alaska. Sarah Palin is looking for full custody of Tripp, 1 year old, holding that Johnston is too immature to be a responsible father and that her mother's drug conviction makes her a danger to the child.
Bristol Palin applied for full custody in November, but Johnston is looking for shared custody. Both parents are 19 years old. Her teenage relationship fell under intense public attention after Senator John McCain elected Sarah Palin as his vice president formula partner in August 2008.
Court documents, now unsealed, were published online on Monday by Anchorage Daily News.
Johnston joined the family at the Republican National Convention after the campaign confirmed that Bristol, then 17, was five months pregnant with her son. The couple broke their engagement about two months after the birth of their son in December 2008.
Johnston has asked that the case conducted in public to protect himself from Sarah Palin, whom he said was powerful, politically ambitious and has a reputation for being extremely vindictive. But Bristol Palin's request for the case to be sealed said public proceedings will turn this custody case into a media circus that's not best for Tripp.
In this day and time of the Internet, media stories remain available for years, even decades, after they are first published, and anything printed in the media - LRB- whether true or not -RRB- will be available to Tripp when he is old enough to read, Palin said in an affidavit.
She said Johnston wanted a public case so he could keep making a spectacle of this custody dispute for his own self-promotion. Johnston was going to participate in a reality show in Alaska, he said.
I don't think it's in Tripp's best interest that Levi's reality show is filming this case as it unfolds, or that Levi Johnston is capitalizing on this custody case through his reality show, Palin said.
Johnston's affidavit said he feared what Sarah Palin could do against him if the case was kept secret.
I really believe that closing the court could make this matter very uncivil and potentially open the door to poor influences in Bristol and his lawyer who can be extremely inappropriate and potentially detrimental to Tripp, he said.
While Johnston said that his ex-girlfriend would never be malicious to him, his mother is powerful, politically ambitious and has a reputation for being extremely vindictive.
So, I think a public case could help a lot to reduce Sarah Palin's instinct to attack and allow the real parties to this litigation, Bristol and I, to resolve things in a much more peaceful way than we could if there was more interference from Sarah Palin, Johnston said.
Bristol Palin's affidavit said her mother is not involved in the custody case, except as a grandmother. But Johnston's lawyer, Rex Butler, said in his own affidavit that his client does not trust closed proceedings because Sarah Palin is known for dealing forcefully with those she perceives as political enemies.
He feels that Sarah Palin, through her lawyer, under the guise of Bristol Palin's name, would run over her bones, Butler said.
The judge's ruling, signed last week, concludes that Bristol Palin did not prove that this case involves matters of a sensitive and highly personal nature of such magnitude that the protection of the party's name outweighs the public interest in disclosure.
His presentation for full custody argued that Levi was not ready for paternity claims and sacrifices that would involve a 19-year-old aspiring actor/model.
Levi remains without a regular job or constant source of income, the petition states. Although he is not enrolled in school to learn a trade or get a degree, he has made money by selling stories about his son and the Palins to the media and participating in luxury models for Playgirl magazine, he says.
The photos published last month showed Johnston in semi-naked poses, not with the complete frontal nudity that is Palin's file cited.
The petition cited a series of posts posted on the online social network Twitter.com as evidence that Johnston may have substance abuse issues, based on statements he has made about the search for grass.
Johnston's response said he doesn't have a Twitter account and hasn't made such statements about marijuana use.
But Palin's toughest attack was on Levi's mother, Sherry Johnston, who pleaded guilty to a felony drug offense earlier this year.
Palin asked to be prevented from having unsupervised visits with Tripp. His petition said he could go back to offending, keep drugs around the house that could be accessible to the baby, that illegal drug users come to the house -LRB- or that he could take the baby in his car during a drug sale -RRB-.
Palin also said that from Sherry Johnston he could fall asleep or be too sleepy to properly monitor the baby.
She is also a chronic pain patient and suffers from regular and sustained daily narcotics infusions, Palin's petition said.
Johnston's response said his mother's chronic pain condition is currently being handled in coordination with the Department of Corrections.
Sherry Johnston will not be left to take care of the little girl alone, but she will simply be there to help the best of her ability, said Johnston's presentation.
She was released from an Alaskan prison last week to serve the remainder of her three-year sentence under house arrest at her home in Wasilla, Alaska. He must wear an ankle bracelet for electronic monitoring, said Richard Schmitz, spokesman for the Department of Corrections.

"Build it and they'll come. That seems to have been the strategy for urban development in China over the past decade, during what could be said has been the largest and fastest urbanization of a society in modern history.
In Zhengzhou, the capital of the central province of Henan, this approach has had mixed results. Just a few years ago, a new development area, a complement to the main city, was labeled China's largest ghost city: rows and rows of luxury apartments and office buildings were empty in vast desert boulevards.
But now the locals here say that signs of life have emerged and that the city is growing.
At a recent national holiday, visitors came to a new park by the river. It was a remarkable green oasis of willows, ponds, fountains and swamps made by man surrounded by new bright towers of glass and steel.
In the middle of the vegetation, several married couples posed in tuxedoes and dresses for professional photographs, the brides pampered by make-up artists.
Among them were the Zhangs, newlyweds who traveled more than a hundred miles for this photo shoot.
Although they clearly appreciated their surroundings, they said they could not afford to live in the recently built large Zhengzhou district.
The same happened with Li Cai Juan, 25, and his friends. Several years ago, she had an office job at a construction company that built some of the rows of Zhengzhou towers.
Pictures of fantasy for Chinese weddings
Now a school teacher, Li said, The housing prices are too high here, in the newly built part of Zhengzhou.
According to the local statistics office, the average monthly income in Zhengzhou is approximately $483 while property prices in the new district are $1,660 per square metre, and is expected to rise.
Amid growing unrest over swollen housing markets, Prime Minister Li Keqiang has made affordable property prices a pillar of his leadership. However, tighter controls on real estate markets, such as limitations on housing per person and increased transaction taxes, have failed to control speculative buyers since they were first applied in 2010.
The following year, as part of its twelfth five-year plan, the government promised to build 36 million low-income homes by 2015 in an attempt to suffocate struggling home buyers.
The rush to the cities
The demand for housing has followed the migration of workers from rural areas to cities where work is better paid and easier to find. In early 2012, for the first time in history, figures showed that more than half of the country's population lives in urban areas.
The pace of urbanization has been staggering and the government has it as the main engine of economic growth over the coming decades.
Currently, China’s urban population is just over 700 million people, said Tom Miller, author of China’s Urban Billion.
By 2030, we expect it to be a billion. One in eight people on Earth will live in a Chinese city. So they still need to make a lot more building.
Miller predicts that there will always be a high demand for housing in China. The challenge will be to make it affordable for the Chinese people.
The rise of the population of Zhengzhou
According to the city's government statistics, the population of Zhengzhou grew by 30% between 2000 and 2010, and today stands at about nine million people, approximately the same population as that of New York City - LRB- 8,245 million in 2011 -RRB-, London -LRB- 8,174, 2011 -RRB- and Bangkok -LRB- 8,281, 2010 -RRB-.
But the city seems to have grown even faster physically.
In an area nearly twice the size of San Francisco, new tower districts have emerged where 10 years ago locals say there were empty fields.
The armies of the construction teams continue to work hard. Dozens of new towers are in several stages of completion, despite the fact that real estate companies are still clearly struggling to fill some of the finished buildings.
On a street corner, two college students distributed advertising leaflets to passing drivers and raised a two-storey purchase for the price of a deal for a residential development called Harmony Building.
In the office of another real estate development company, a sales representative told CNN that all units of the neighboring residential towers had been sold. If so, no one bothered to keep the grounds around apartment buildings where grass and weeds grew between 30-story towers.
Speculators move in
Meanwhile, real estate sales seemed to move faster at the Zheng Dong Business Center, where visitors were greeted by soccer tables, plush velvet sofas, a piano, wine and entremess arranged around giant illuminated models of an office park.
Upon arrival, a sales team accompanied CNN to a 180-degree cinema, IMAX screen that played an elaborate computer illustrated film announcing five-star hotels, gyms, shopping malls, offices and restaurants that would one day populate the new development.
It would be another five or six years before this virtual city center was completed, said a saleswoman named Song Lei.
Asked whether or not she expected enough customers to fill the gigantic office park, Song said, Overall, probably not.
There are some people who buy office buildings for investment and there are others who are using it themselves, he explained.
Some of China’s growing real estate market seems to be driven by wealthy Chinese who prefer to park their money in property rather than in banks where interest rates remain the same as inflation. In less than a year, real estate prices in Zhengzhou increased by 14 %, while the reference interest rate remains at 3 %.
Two Chinese men working as contractors in the construction industry were finalizing an agreement on the purchase of two offices in the unfinished office park of the Zheng Dong Business Center.
Both men said they owned several properties in the area, some of which were vacant.
He owns 20 apartments here! said one of the employer's employees, laughing. Return after 10 years and take a look and it will be completely different, he said, when asked about Zhengzhou's ghost city label.
The businessman, who asked not to be named, said he earned much better returns on real estate than on banks.
Miller said the purchase of properties in China is encouraged by the fact that, unlike many Western countries, there is no annual property tax.
You pay transaction taxes when you buy a property, but once the purchases do not pay anything, which is remarkable, he said.
Build them and they'll come?
Compared to China, the history of urbanization in the West is different. Things happened at a much slower pace, said Behzad Yaghmaian, a political economist and author of The Accidental Capitalist -- A People's Story of the New China.
China is a huge country with the ability to supply the world and now its own market. Things are going to happen faster and with more mistakes.
The jury is still aware of whether major urban development projects and the new Zhengzhou districts will become vibrant urban centres.
But Miller challenges critics who quickly labeled Zhengzhou a ghost city.
He said that in recent years city planners had built 14 new university campuses in the city, predicting that it would secure a quarter of a million new residents.
China is different because it has this very authoritarian power structure. Power is in the hands of very few people, and that means that local government officials can make big decisions for the future 10, 15 years... and create something for a society that has not yet arrived, Miller said.
“It is to build them and they will come,” Miller added, “and build them and force them to come.” But, of course, there will be some great wasteful developments, white elephants, along the way.

"Vienna is the best city in the world to live, Baghdad is the worst and London, Paris and New York don't even make it the top 35, according to international research on quality of life.
German-speaking cities dominate rankings in the 18th Mercer Quality of Life studio, with Vienna in the top seven places.
Paris has fallen through the league, dropping ten places at 37, just ahead of London at 39, almost entirely due to the city's vulnerability to terrorist attacks.
The study examined social and economic conditions, health, education, housing and the environment, and is used by large companies to assess where they should be located and how much they should pay staff.
Helena Hartlauer, 32, born in Vienna, said she was not surprised by the highest position in her city. The municipality’s social democratic government has a long tradition of investing in high-quality social housing, making Vienna almost only affordable among major cities.
“I live in an apartment of 100 square meters at the beginning of the century in a good area about 20 minutes walk from the city center. But my rent is only €800 (£625) per month.” An equivalent apartment in London would cost more than £2,000 and even more in New York, which occupies 44th place on the table.
American cities have relatively poor performance in the study, largely due to problems related to personal security and crime. The highest city in the United States is San Francisco, in 28th; Boston is 34th. Canadian cities, led by Vancouver, far surpass their American rivals at the table.
“You don’t realize how safe Vienna is until you go abroad,” Hartlauer said. “We also have excellent public transport, with 24-hour underground work on weekends, and it costs only €1 per trip.”
Vienna benefited greatly from the fall of the Berlin Wall, becoming the gateway to the countries of Eastern Europe that often have historical ties to the former Austro-Hungarian empire.
“Our great USP is our geographical location,” said Martin Eichtinger, Austrian ambassador to London, who lived in Vienna for 20 years. “The fall of the Berlin Wall helped define Vienna as the centre of businesses that want to do business in Central Europe.”
According to the World Bank, Austria has one of the highest per capita GDP figures in the world, just behind the US. and ahead of Germany and Britain, though well below neighboring Switzerland.
Zurich in Switzerland is named by Mercer as having the second highest quality of life in the world, but the Viennese say their city is much more fun. “There are more students in Vienna than in any other German-speaking city,” Hartlauer said. “It is a city of very rapid growth, young and lively,” he added, although he acknowledged that he works for the city’s tourist board.
Vienna has long been overlooked by British holiday weekend tourists in the city, who instead come to Barcelona or Berlin and tend to think of Austria as a place for skiing, lakes and mountains. But, after an increase in budget flights from British regional cities such as Manchester and Edinburgh, Vienna is rapidly catching up as a popular destination. In 2015, there were 588,000 British visitors to Vienna, 18% more than the previous year. The flow is both ways; Eichtinger said London has become the city's number one destination for Austrian visitors.
“Vienna ranks first in the last seven published rankings,” Mercer said. “It has a high score in several categories; it provides a safe and stable environment in which to live, a high level of public services and transport facilities and good recreational facilities.”
The European migrant crisis, which has seen a large number of refugees and asylum seekers pass through Vienna on their way to Germany, has had little impact on the city of nearly 1.8 million people, Eichtinger said. “We have managed to house 90,000 refugees in Austria, but the numbers have fallen in recent months.” London has never been in the top 10 quality of life, says Mercer, damaged by its low rates of air pollution, traffic congestion and climate. After London, Edinburgh is the next British city, in the 46th place.
Paris has suffered the biggest drop in the most recent rankings. “Paris remained stable for several years, but this year has fallen ten places in the overall ranking,” Mercer said.
“The fall was essentially due to the terrorist attacks of 2015. However, it is important to note that security issues are a very weighted factor within the ‘basket’ so that any small adjustments can have a great impact on the ranking.”
Auckland in New Zealand was the highest English-speaking city in the survey, thirdly followed by Vancouver in fifth place. Australian cities also have a very high performance in the survey, with Sydney 10 and Melbourne 15. The Economist has always rated Melbourne as the most habitable city in the world, although its poll has been criticized as too Anglocentric.
War and political unrest are behind all the worst-class cities in the world. Surprisingly, Damascus is named the seventh worst, ranked better than not only Baghdad, but also Bangui in the Central African Republic, Sana’a in Yemen, Port-au-Prince in Haiti, Khartoum in Sudan and N’Djamena in Chad.

"Unveiling a car with a maximum speed of 25 mph, two seats and no pedals or steering wheel may not make much impression on a motor show. But Google, in the US, sent a minor earthquake through the automobile and taxi industries, as it revealed the latest version of its driverless car.
The electrically powered vehicle, which Google has started testing around its headquarters in Mountain View, California, dispenses with all normal controls, including pedals. Instead, it has an application for smartphones that invokes it and tells you the destination, and a single STOP button mounted between the two front seats in case the occupants need to override the computer.
The car, in fact, takes over all navigation, steering, acceleration and braking tasks.
The company is building about 100 prototypes for a two-year test. The company’s co-founder, Sergey Brin, said at a conference in California that the vehicle was “still in the prototype stage,” but that the project was “about changing the world for people who are not well served by transportation today. ”
He said about the car: “You’re just sitting there; there’s no steering wheel, no pedals. For me, it was very relaxing. About ten seconds after I walked in, I forgot I was there. It reminded me of the capture of a chairlift by yourself - a bit of loneliness seemed really nice to me.”
Google says that the main objective of the project is to improve safety and that, because the car is built with shock absorbent foam on the front and a plastic windshield, “it must be much safer than any other car for pedestrians.”
Cars, which have been specially built by a company (still unnamed) in Detroit, will be used to further investigate the best way to run vehicles without a driver. Google will run a pilot program using cars, which are not yet for sale.
A challenge is to create high definition road and surrounding scans before cars can drive along them because they cannot collect and process enough information in real time.
So far, there are large-scale maps of some 2,000 kilometers of California roads, but the state has more than 170,000 kilometers of public roads.
Google says it is interested in licensing technology to traditional vehicle manufacturers once it has been sufficiently refined. Team members had been working on the project even before joining Google for more than a decade.
But the prospect of driverless cars replacing taxis with a human engine has been the cause of some alarm.
“If you get rid of the driver, then they’re unemployed,” said Dennis Conyon, the southeast director of the UK National Taxi Association. “It would have a big impact on the workforce.”
London has about 22,000 licensed black taxis and Conyon estimates that the total number of people driving rental taxis in the UK is about 100,000.
However, Steve McNamara, general secretary of the 10,500-person London Taxi Drivers’ Association, said: “You won’t have these driverless cars in London for 20 or 25 years. Perhaps, by then, they have a charging point, because now there is not one in London.”
Other car manufacturers, including Volvo, Ford and Mercedes, are working on driver-assisted vehicles, which, unlike the Google version, do not dispense with driver controls.
But Chris Urmson, director of the self-driving project at Google, said the new prototypes dispensed with the steering wheel and brakes because there was no guarantee that a human occupant could take charge of an emergency, and that it was easier to have just one emergency stop button.
Urmson said: “Vehicles will be very basic. We want to learn from them and adapt them as soon as possible. But they'll take you wherever you want to go just by pressing a button. And that is an important step towards improving road safety and transforming mobility for millions of people.”
So far, Google versions of self-driving cars have covered 700,000 miles without an accident caused by the computer. The company notes that thousands of people die every year on the roads and that about 80% of accidents can be attributed to human errors.
But, they might have some way to go match Conyon at the National Taxi Association. At 79, he's been driving a taxi for 50 years and claims he's never had an accident.

"In American cities like New York and Los Angeles, many people live in small apartments. Despite not having houses with large patios, some apartment dwellers still seek the company that pets like dogs and cats offer. Some people feel that having a pet, even in a small space, is good at teaching the responsibility of children.

However, many owners prohibit tenants from having pets, specifically cats and dogs, due to the damage animals can do to carpets. Some landowners even forbid birds because of the noise they make. Many owners charge an extra fee, known as a pet deposit, to tenants who want to keep pets. This is to pay for repairs or cleaning caused by the pet.
Many times apartment dwellers will choose animals, such as fish, hermit crabs, guinea pigs or hamsters, which make little noise, little mess, and do not chew furniture. Other people keep lizards as pets, as they do not require much space and can be kept in small cages or tanks. Another benefit of these smaller pets is that they do not need to be walked. However, some people living in apartments have pets that are not so common. Some of these pets, which are not common, include mammals such as hedgehogs, amphibians such as frogs, and spiders such as tarantulas. However, not all exotic pets are legal.
To maintain public safety, some cities and states have laws that prohibit specific animals like pets. New York City, for example, forbids people to keep ferrets, turtles, pythons, and scorpions as pets. It seems unlikely that a family will have a polar bear named Fluffy or a whale called Bubbles as a pet, New York has specific laws prohibiting these wild animals from the residences. These laws exist for good reason. In 2003, a man in a Manhattan apartment was discovered to have a 350 pound Bengal tiger as a pet.",C1
"You can no longer legally smoke a cigarette inside a bar in the drinking capital of the world, New Orleans, Louisiana. City after city has banned indoor smoking, but that is different because other cities do not attract tourist dollars by aggressively announcing an attitude of “good times move,” as New Orleans does. An indoor smoking ban here will have consequences as unique as New Orleans' own cultural ecosystem.
As the Wall Street Journal recently reported, the New Orleans City government, since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, has begun trying to reduce the volume a little. With the support of neighborhood groups, the city has begun to more strictly monitor bars and nightclubs, while at the same time struggling to implement a new “noise order” (read: musical ordinance).
“This is the wrong time for them to have pursued something like this,” complains bar owner William Walker, who, for reasons of personal choice, hates tobacco law. “To force people to smoke outside the bar will exacerbate the tension that already exists.”
Many of New Orleans' best bars and some of its live music venues are located in relatively quiet residential neighborhoods. This neighborhood cohabitation is a large part of what makes New Orleans different and charming. However, recently this unique social contract has become unacceptable to some people and the fate of New Orleans' musical personality is at stake.
Martha Wood lives next to a noisy bar that hosts live music. “The bar was one of the decisive factors in my purchase of the house, so I will never complain about the noise,” says Wood, who also runs a live music bar that, after a series of noise problems in 2013 (including complaints about loud smokers outside), became one of the first bars in New Orleans that legally is not allowed to serve drinks to go. “Now, any small infraction could close us,” Wood says. “We recently installed a smoke dining room to help with the smoke because we can’t open the doors at night because of the ‘noise’.”
The Maple Leaf club was voluntarily smoke-free in 2014 as was another club where artists had been demanding smoke-free nights. “Many of the performance venues were already beginning to show that consideration to the performers, so I would like the city to have let that happen instead of forcing the ban on every corner bar that doesn’t host music,” says Zalia BeVille, manager of the All Ways Lounge, who ran out of smoke in 2013 because, he says, “The trumpeters and singers, they asked us.”
Luckily, All Ways has an outdoor patio, unlike Lost Love Lounge, whose owner, Geoff Douville, adores the ban – had previously felt compelled to live in smoke to keep his bar economically viable. “There’s no way I could have banned smoking in my bar without it being a rule throughout the city,” Douville says. “People act like I have that choice, as a business owner. But if I make that rule, they walk around the block to a smoking bar. So I need everyone to be in uniform.”
Many small business owners also fear loss of revenue without smoke. Smoker Neil Timms owns an English pub and complied with the smoking ban earlier in England. “Back home in Coventry, every pub where I was a regular closed within a year of the smoking ban,” recalls Timms of the UK ban, launched in 2007. To avoid the same fate, he's spending money on building a courtyard.
However, Lost Love’s Douville feels that prohibition is a great business opportunity. “The number of people who would enjoy going out to our bar, with our food, but they would never come because they didn’t want to smell smoke for the next seven days – now we’re an option for all those people.” Neither does Douville worry about noise complaints like Walker does: “No court will label a bar as “nuisance” after the city has ratified a smoking ban that requires you to leave,” he says. “I want to see a judge reconcile ‘not loitering’ with ‘not smoking inside’.”
Councilwoman LaToya Cantrell, who introduced and advanced the ban, disagrees: “The bar owner’s responsibility is to keep his clientele respectful outside their establishment as well,” she says. “The owners and waiters need to tell them to go smoke but be respectful of their communities. The idea that we can't have clean air because it will cause noise problems is ridiculous. It can be a win-win. I think it’s about communication and building partnerships between communities and businesses.”
Cantrell recognizes the uniqueness of the city in terms of smoking ban. “How does New Orleans differ from the rest of the country? New Orleans is known as ""the city that cares about oblivion,"" he says. “New Orleans needs to stand up and say ‘We care about our people.’ The most vulnerable people who are working in smoke conditions, these citizens are the backbone of our hospitality industry, which drives the economy in the state of Louisiana.” Add, “New Orleans is also different from other places because you have the option of drinking your drink outside with you when you go out to smoke.”
Many were concerned that the already tense New Orleans Police Department did not need to be involved in monitoring smokers. So the health department will take care of warnings and fines. Bar customers are encouraged to “come to fill out a form or call 311 and include time and date photographs documenting illegal smoking.” For this reason alone, Neil Timms says he will comply with the ban: “I don’t want someone sitting on the corner smoking and someone taking a picture of them and getting hit.”
No worries, Geoff Douville says he's already used to noise complaints, so he brings the ban. “Look: the nosy neighbors who complain about the noise are now going to be the same ones who wanted the smoking ban to start.” In the end, Douville shares Cantrell's optimism. “Of course they’re going to complain,” he accepts. “But that doesn’t mean they’re going to win.”

"Yellowstone National Park, located in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming, was established as the first national park in the United States. The park is a popular destination for visitors who enjoy ecotourism as it offers forests, mountains and abundant ecosystems to explore. Some of Yellowstone's best-known monuments are its geothermal and geysers hot springs, the most famous of which is called Old Faithful.
Last fall, Lisa and her friends decided to take a camping trip to Yellowstone National Park. They were arranged to stay in one of the many convenient campsites in the park. For their camping trip, they brought their backpacks, sleeping bags and a refrigerator of food and drinks. They set up their tents immediately after arriving at their camp.
During their journey, Lisa and her friends walked along the park's numerous trails, exploring its natural surroundings. In the forest, they saw a lot of local wildlife. Lisa was surprised to see a family of brown bears, some grey wolves, and even bald eagles flying over. Outside the forest, they admired the beauty of some of Yellowstone's natural waterfalls.
Since Yellowstone contains many thermal sources and the world's largest area of active geysers, Lisa and her friends visited many different geysers sites. They even spent an afternoon swimming in the Yellowstone Boiling River. Of all places, Lisa and her friends agreed that Old Faithful was the most impressive. Lisa and her friends were patiently waiting for the geyser to explode. After about 40 minutes, a boiling stream of water more than 100 feet high sprayed from the ground and upwards in the air. Luckily, no one got wet!",C1
"When exploring New York City, there are several different options for activities during a one-day excursion. Some visitors come to see a show, to visit art museums or simply to buy at many of the city's high-end retailers. However, many tourists simply come to New York City for sightseeing. One of the most visited monuments in New York City is the Empire State Building.
The Empire State Building, built in 1931, is a 102-story skyscraper, the ninth tallest building in the world, and the fourth highest structure in the United States. It is located in Midtown, Manhattan. This skyscraper is an iconic symbol of the city, having been featured in more than 90 popular films (from 2018) throughout the history of cinema. Tourists come from all over the world to visit this building and see the city from its famous observation decks.
Matthew, an enthusiast of historic buildings, was excited about this trip to New York City because he has always appreciated architectural design. Matthew bought a ticket that gave him access to beautiful 360-degree views of the city. The ticket included an elevator ride that stopped at two different points of view, one on the 86th floor and the other at the rooftop observatory on the 102nd floor. From these observation decks, Matthew took incredible photographs of the entire New York City horizon. The rooftop views gave Matthew perfect aerial perspectives of Central Park, the Brooklyn Bridge, Times Square, the Statue of Liberty and many other important landmarks of the city.",C1
"A new study published in the journal Science shows definitive evidence of organic matter on the surface of Mars. The data was collected by NASA's Rover Curiosity. It confirms previous findings that the Red Planet once contained carbon compounds. These compounds, also called organic molecules, are essential ingredients for life as scientists understand it.
Organic molecules were found in the crater Gale de Mars, a large area that could have been an aqueous lake more than three billion years ago. The rover found traces of the molecule on rocks extracted from the area. The rocks also contain sulfur, which scientists speculate helped preserve the organic ones even when the rocks were exposed to harsh radiation on the planet's surface.

Scientists are quick to say that the presence of these organic molecules is not sufficient evidence for ancient life on Mars, as molecules could have been formed by non-living processes. But it remains one of the most amazing discoveries, which could lead to future revelations. Especially when one considers the other surprising finds that Curiosity discovered about five years ago.

The rover periodically analyzes the air around it, and in 2014 found that the air contained another of the most basic organic molecules and a key ingredient of natural gas: methane. One of the characteristics of methane is that it only survives a few hundred years. This means something, somewhere on Mars, is resupplying the supply. According to NASA, Mars emits thousands of tons of methane at once. The methane level rises and falls at seasonal intervals in the year, almost as if the planet were breathing it.

NASA suspects that methane comes from the depths of the planet's surface. Temperature variations on the surface of Mars cause the molecule to flow upwards to higher or lower levels. For example, in the Martian winter the gas could be trapped in underground ice cream crystals. These crystals, called clatrates, melt in summer and release the gas. However, the source of methane remains a complete mystery.

The world of astrobiology considers both studies as historical milestones. According to this information, Mars is not a dead planet. On the contrary, it is quite active and may be changing and becoming more habitable.

Of course, this means that further research is needed. Scientists say they need to send new equipment to Mars, equipment that can measure air and soil more accurately. Missions are already underway. The European Space Agency's ExoMars ship will land in 2020 and will be able to drill on Mars to analyze what it finds. In addition, NASA is sending another Mars Rover in the same year to collect samples of Martian soil and return them to Earth.

The possibility of living on Mars has fascinated humans for generations. He has been the subject of endless novels and science fiction films. Are we alone in the universe or have there been other forms of life within our Solar System? If the current missions to the Red Planet continue, it seems as if we can discover the answer very soon.",C1
"For 85 years, it was little more than a grey spot without features on the class maps of the solar system, but, on July 15, Pluto was first seen in high resolution, revealing spectacular mountain ranges made of solid water ice on a scale to rival the Alps or the Rockies.
The extraordinary images of the ancient ninth planet and its great moon, Charon, carried 4 billion miles back to Earth from the New Horizons spacecraft, marking the climax of a mission that has been on silently for almost a decade.
Alan Stern, the main investigator of the mission, described the images as a “home run” for the team. “New Horizons is already returning amazing results. The data looks absolutely magnificent, and Pluto and Charon are simply mind-blowing.”
One of the biggest surprises was the discovery that “there are mountains in the Kuiper belt, ” the mysterious “third zone” of the solar system, where Pluto sits among some 100,000 smaller frozen objects. John Spencer, a mission scientist, said the mountains seem to be about 11,000 feet tall and several hundred miles wide. “They are quite important mountains.”
The detailed picture of an edge of the dwarf planet did not show a single crater, indicating that the surface has recently been “paved” by geological activity, which could include dramatic geysers firing ice feathers into the atmosphere or cryovolcanos bursting into ice explosions instead of molten rock.
In a wink at the former status of Pluto as the ninth planet, until it was degraded to a dwarf planet in 2006, the NASA press conference began with a reduction of spectacular images of the sun and the eight official planets. “We’ve focused what used to be a blur point of light,” said NASA spokesman Dwayne Brown, as scientists and journalists expected the image to be unveiled.
Stern described the images as “only skiing the surface” of what would be learned about the planet over the next year. They've already produced some surprises. Scientists believe that mountains are made of water ice with only a thin layer of “exotic” ice, methane and nitrogen. “You can’t make mountains with methane and nitrogen,” Spencer said.
“The water ice is strong enough to hold big mountains and that’s what we think we’re seeing here. This is the first time we've seen this. Methane and nitrogen are just a coating.” It is likely that the Pluto Mountains have not formed more than 100 million years ago, most recently given the 4.56 billion-year-old solar system. This suggests that the foreground region, which covers about 1% of Pluto's surface, may remain geologically active. The images are the first to show mountains of ice outside the moons of giant planets and raises the question of what kind of geological process the mountain landscape could be generating.
The structures, along with the softness of Pluto's surface, suggest that geological activity is taking place and softening depressions caused by asteroid impacts. Scientists believe that this process of “pavementation” could be the result of the internal heat that softens the rock and ice or snowfalls that cover the surface. For the scale, the images are so detailed that, if the ship was flying over London, we could choose the tracks at Heathrow Airport.
The distance to Pluto – 5 billion km – means that it takes hours of New Horizons to send a single photo and it will take 16 months to send all the data you have accumulated during the flight. The team also announced that the visible heart-shaped feature in Pluto will now be known as the Tombaugh Regio, in honor of Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered the dwarf planet in 1930.
Charon's new vision reveals a varied and complex terrain. An area of cliffs and valleys that extend about 1,000 km suggests a generalized fracture of Charon's surface, which could also be the result of geological activity. The image also shows a dramatic cannon estimated to be 7 to 9 km deep.
Cathy Olkin, a missionary scientist, said: “Charon just blew his socks off when today we have the new image. The team just got booed.
Only in this image is there so much interesting science.” Pluto is believed to be composed of about two thirds of rock enclosed in a pile of ice, with surface temperatures of about 230C. As the £460 million mission travels to Kuiper's belt, scientists expect it to open a window over the ancient solar system and the origins of the planets, potentially helping to explain the formation of the Earth itself.
Andrew Coates, head of planetary science at Mullard Space Science Laboratory, said: “These Kuiper belt objects are the building blocks of the outer solar system. They are all very cold – it is like a deep cosmic freeze. It is the best way to preserve the history of the solar system. That's what's fascinating about this. It’s a really exciting time for the exploration of the solar system.”
In August 2015, the mission scientists will choose which of the two objects they will visit next. NASA estimates that the ship will be able to continue recording and broadcasting until the mid 2030s. Then, your plutonium energy source will run out and shut down, drifting outward to the edge of the solar system and deep space beyond.
New Horizons also observed smaller members of the Pluto system, which includes four other moons: Nix, Hydra, Styx and Kerberos. A new sneaky image of Hydra is the first to reveal its apparent irregular shape and size, estimated at about 43 by 33 km. “New Horizons is a true exploration mission, which shows us why basic scientific research is so important,” said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator of NASA’s Scientific Mission Management.
“The mission has had nine years to create expectations about what we would see during the closest approach to Pluto and Charon. Today, we get the first sample of the scientific treasure collected during those critical moments and I can tell you that it dramatically exceeds those high expectations.”
Observations also indicate that Hydra's surface is likely to be covered with aquatic ice. Future images will reveal more clues about the formation of this, and the other moon, billions of years ago.

"According to Oxfam, the vast fortunes of the world’s 100 richest billionaires are increasing inequality and hampering the world’s ability to cope with poverty.
The charity said that accumulation of wealth and income on an unprecedented scale, often at the expense of safe jobs and decent wages for the poorest, undermined the ability of people who survive with help or low wages to improve their situation and escape poverty.
Oxfam said the world's poorest could get out of poverty several times if the 100 richest billionaires gave away the money they made in 2012.
Without pointing the finger at people, the charity argued that the net income of $240 billion accumulated in 2012 by the 100 richest billionaires would be enough to make history of extreme poverty four times more.
It is rare for charities to attack the rich, who are generally seen as a source of funding. Bill Gates and Warren Buffett are among a group of 40 U.S. billionaires who have pledged much of their wealth to help projects, but there is little detail about the level of their annual donations. Nor have their actions been matched by Russian, Middle Eastern or Chinese billionaires.
In the report, The Cost of Inequality: How Wealth and Income Extremes Hurt Us All, published just before the World Economic Forum in Davos, the organization calls on world leaders to restrict income extremes and commit themselves to reducing inequality at least to 1990 levels.
The report found that the richest 1 per cent had increased their income by 60 per cent in the past 20 years, and the financial crisis accelerated rather than slowed the process.
Barbara Stocking, Oxfam’s executive director, said extreme wealth was “economically inefficient, politically corrosive, socially divisive and environmentally destructive.”
He said studies show that countries suffer from low levels of investment and growth, as workers are forced to survive with a lower proportion of total income.
She said: “We can no longer pretend that the creation of wealth for a few will inevitably benefit many – too often the opposite is true.”
The report says that the issue affects all parts of the world. “In the United Kingdom, inequality is rapidly returning to levels not seen since the time of Charles Dickens [the 19th century novelist]. In China, the top 10 percent now takes home almost 60 percent of income. Chinese inequality levels are now similar to those of South Africa, which is now the most unequal and significantly more unequal country in the world than at the end of apartheid.”
In the US, the share of national income reaching the top 1% has doubled since 1980 from 10 to 20%, the report says. For the top 0.01%, the share of national income is above the levels last seen in the 1920s.
The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have argued that extreme income inequality undermines growth and both organizations have sought to link their loans to programmes that limit the growth of inequality.
It is estimated that members of the richest 1 per cent use up to 10,000 times more carbon than the average United States citizen.
Oxfam said world leaders should learn from countries like Brazil, which has grown rapidly while reducing inequality.
Stocking said: “We need a new global deal to reverse decades of growing inequality. As a first step, world leaders should formally commit themselves to reducing inequality to the levels observed in 1990.”
He said closing tax havens, which the Tax Justice Network says have up to $31 billion, or up to a third of all world wealth, could produce $189 billion in additional tax revenue.

"Michael Jackson's ex-wife and the mother of her two older children, Debbie Rowe, has agreed not to challenge the singer's mother for child custody, according to a joint statement by Rowe and Katherine Jackson's lawyers.
Debbie Rowe will not pursue custody of the children she had with Michael Jackson, says a lawyer.
The agreement does not imply any financial payment to Rowe other than the continuation of the spousal support payments that Michael Jackson personally agreed to make to Rowe after his divorce, lawyers said.
Rowe will get visiting rights with the children and the time, frequency and form of the visits will be implemented in accordance with the best interests of the children, as determined by a child psychologist selected jointly, and paid jointly by Jackson and Rowe, the announcement said.
Rowe never publicly said if she was going to fight Jackson's 79-year-old mother for the custody of her son and daughter, 11 and 12, and a court hearing on custody was delayed several times this month while both of them's lawyers spoke. Jackson's youngest son, 7 years old, was taken by a surrogate mother, whose name has not yet been released.
Katherine Jackson obtained temporary guardianship from the three children shortly after her death last month. Learn about other notable custody cases
The agreement must be approved by the judge. A custody hearing is scheduled for Monday before Los Angeles County High Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff.
Beckloff will also hear discussions on Monday about Jackson's estate and who will control it. Katherine Jackson is asking the court for more involvement in the estate business. Look what could have happened in Jackson's last few hours.
Jackson's family attorney, Londell McMillan, said the family was pleased that the custody issue was resolved and handled carefully, thoughtfully and politely by the parties and their representatives.
We were all united in our goals to do what is best for Michael's wonderful children, and both Mrs. Jackson as Debbie Rowe were on the same page, McMillan said. Consequently, although important issues had to be resolved, it was not a legal challenge, but rather a process - LRB- of -RRB - which did the right thing for the right reasons.
Rowe's lawyer, Eric George, said that women and their lawyers participated in a dignified discussion that resulted in a worthy outcome.
The only consideration between the parties was the best interests of the children, George said. I am proud to have worked with those professionals who represented Mrs. Jackson, and I'm particularly proud of Deborah for her integrity and self-denial.
Efforts to resolve who will control Jackson's estate have not been so friendly.
Earlier this month, Beckloff granted temporary control to executors named in his 2002 will: John Branca, Jackson's long-time personal lawyer, and John McClain, a music industry executive and long-time friend.
McMillan, in a statement issued on Wednesday, said Katherine Jackson was not disputing the will. But, he said, she wanted the judge to order the executors to disclose information about what he said was a suspicious circle of relationships involving them.
He said that the executors have denied Ms. Jackson access to critical information or have insisted on onerous and unreasonable restrictions on information about the dealings they are doing in the name of the inheritance.
McMillan, in an interview with CBS on Thursday, estimated that the Jackson estate was worth $2 billion, while the executors have estimated in court that its value is about $500 million.
The will placed all assets in a family trust that benefited her mother, her three children, and nameless charities.
Jackson's children have been living with their paternal grandmother in their Encino, California, home since their father's death on June 25.
They read the news on the Web and the reports, McMillan said. I really tried to push the media to be responsible for how they try to handle this issue because there are three precious children involved.
The eldest son, Michael Joseph Jackson Jr., better known as Prince Michael, was born in February 1997. One daughter, Paris Michael Katherine Jackson, was born the following year.
Details of how children were conceived -- and who the biological father was -- have been carefully guarded in the midst of much public speculation.
The couple divorced in 1999 with Rowe giving Jackson full custody while she got a $8.5 million settlement, according to court documents. Jackson later agreed to additional support.
Rowe resigned from Jackson's parental rights in 2001, but changed his mind more than two years later and sought temporary custody of the children. A California appeals court later ruled that his rights were unduly suppressed, opening the door to a possible custody battle.

"Protesters in a Turkish border town hit by a double car-bombing a week ago clashed with police on Saturday, while expressing anger over the government's response to the attack.
About 50 people were killed and about 100 injured when the explosions exploded in the southern city of Reyhanli, across the border of Idlib province in Syria, on 11 May. One was in the town hall of the community and the other was in front of a post office.
Saturday's protest began relatively peacefully, but went down into chaos when street clashes broke out with the police.
Protesters threw stones and bottles at the police, who responded by firing tear gas canisters and high-pressure paint balls. The officers also pulled out a water cannon.
Women and children ran out of the scene as thick clouds of tear gas spread through the streets at the heart of the confrontation.
Police prevented protesters from reaching the explosion site in the centre of the city, which is located in Hatay province in southern Turkey.
The police have not yet commented on the clashes, which calmed down after less than an hour.
The protest, which began with several thousand people but was reduced to a hard core of several hundred when the problem broke out, was intended to show support and solidarity for the people of Reyhanli following the deadly bombings.
Many people in the city are angry at the government's response and say their decision to take Syrian refugees fleeing the conflict in their country has made Turkey a target of attacks.
The crowd sang for Erdogan and the government to resign.
A family of protesters mourned the death of Ayten Calim, a 20-year-old secretary of Reyhanli who died in the bombings last Saturday.
His brother, Halim Calim, said: We are here to express our pain. He and another brother wore Turkish flags and a banner with Ayten's photo on it that read, ""We won't forget it.""
Some have criticized Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan for traveling to the United States this week rather than coming to Reyhanli to show support.
Erdogan has had talks with U.S. President Barack Obama and other U.S. officials in Washington.
Turkish President Abdullah Gul visited Reyhanli on Thursday, when he promised that those responsible for the car bombs would be held accountable.
Celalettin Lekesiz, governor of Hatay province, said on Saturday that security forces had arrested 17 people so far in connection with the bombings and are hunting four others, said the semi-official agency Anadolu.
The 21 suspects are Turkish nationals, he said.
Lekesiz said the security forces now had detailed information on how the suspects allegedly acquired the explosives and carried out the bombings, the news agency reported.
Interior Minister Muammer Guler and other Turkish officials have accused a former Marxist terrorist group of allegedly maintaining relations with Al Muhabarat, the Syrian intelligence services, according to Anadolu.

"Sony has reduced the price of the PlayStation 3 by $100, or 17 percent, in the United States, a measure that should boost the out-of-the-box sales of the video game console.
Starting Monday, the current 60 gigabyte PS3 model will cost $499 -- a $100 drop in prices.
The PlayStation 3, which includes a 60 gigabyte hard drive and a Blu-ray HD DVD player, will now cost $500, or $20 more than Microsoft's most expensive Xbox 360 version.
The PS3 continues to cost twice as much as Nintendo's Wii console, whose $250 and motion detection controller has turned it into a best-seller despite its lack of cutting-edge graphics and hard disk.
Our initial expectation is that sales will at least double, said Jack Tretton, executive director of Sony Computer Entertainment America, in an interview.
We have managed to put our production problems behind us on PlayStation 3, reaching a position to pass on savings to consumers, and our attitude is the sooner the better.
The price drop on Monday was widely anticipated by industry analysts despite Sony President Ryoji Chubachi telling Reuters last week that the company had no immediate plans for one.
Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Morgan, said Sony's price reduction would not double sales, but could increase them by 50 percent to about 120,000 units a month.
The biggest importance is that Sony is pointing to the market that we're lowering the cost curve pretty fast at doing this thing. It's a very consumer-friendly move, Pachter said.
Sony's move comes two days before the start of the annual E3 fair of the gaming industry in Santa Monica, California, where some expect Microsoft to respond with its first price cuts on the Xbox 360.
Nintendo, whose Wii is selling so well that it is still hard to find in stores eight months after its launch, is not expected to move in prices.
The Xbox 360 and Wii have sold the PS3 on several occasions in the crucial US market, leaving Sony, whose PlayStation 2 dominated the latest generation of consoles, in the unknown position of catching up.
Sony has the price reduction to help you significantly increase PS3 sales before the crucial holiday shopping season that represents most of the annual sales of highly profitable gaming software.
Sony is also presenting a new version of the PS3 with an 80 gigabyte hard drive and a copy of Motorstorm, an all-terrain racing game that has already sold a million copies.
The new model will sell for $600 and is aimed at players who expect to download a lot of games and other content from Sony's flourishing online network.
Sony also expects the PS3 to win some converts after Microsoft's admission last week that the failure rate of its Xbox 360 console had been unacceptably high, forcing it to reserve $1 billion in repair costs.
We are especially proud that the PlayStation 3 has the lowest failure rate of any PlayStation product. It's absolutely the gold standard, Tretton said.
The quality of the product and the long-term viability is what ultimately wins. E-mail to a friend

"Much of today's business is carried out across international borders, and while most of the global business community could share the use of English as a common language, the nuances and expectations of business communication could differ greatly from culture to culture. The lack of understanding of the cultural norms and practices of our business acquaintances can lead to unfair trials, misunderstandings and ruptures in communication. Here are three basic areas of differences in business labeling around the world that could help keep you in a good place when you are then working with someone from a different culture.
Addressing someone
When discussing this topic in a training course, a German apprentice and a British apprentice entered into a heated debate about whether it was appropriate for someone with a doctorate to use the corresponding title on their business card. The British apprentice argued that anyone who was not a doctor who expected to be treated as 'Dr' was disgustingly pompous and full of themselves. The German apprentice, however, argued that the hard work and years of education he put on winning that the doctorate should give them full rights to expect to be addressed as 'Dr'.
This marked difference of opinion about something that could be conceived as minor and thus easily overlooked shows that we often assign meaning even to the most mundane practices. When the things we are used to are done differently, it could provoke the strongest reactions in us. While many continental and Latin American Europeans prefer to be treated with a title, for example, Mr or Mrs and her surname when they meet someone in a business context for the first time, Americans, and increasingly British, now tend to prefer to use their first names. The best thing you can do is listen and watch your conversation partner go and, if you're not sure yet, don't be afraid to ask them how they'd like to be approached.
Smiling
A famous Russian proverb claims that ""a smile without reason is a sign of idiocy"" and a so-called ""smile of respect"" is seen as insincere and often regarded with suspicion in Russia. However, in countries such as the United States, Australia and Great Britain, the smile is often interpreted as a sign of openness, friendship and respect, and is often used to break the ice.
In a research on smiles across cultures, researchers found that smiling individuals were considered smarter than non-smiling people in countries such as Germany, Switzerland, China and Malaysia. However, in countries such as Russia, Japan, South Korea and Iran, the images of smiling faces were described as less intelligent than the non-smiling ones. Meanwhile, in countries like India, Argentina and Maldives, the smile was associated with dishonesty.
Visual contact
An American or British person might be looking their customers in the eye to show that they are paying all the attention to what is said, but if that customer is from Japan or Korea, they might find direct contact to the eyes uncomfortable or even disrespectful. In some parts of South America and Africa, prolonged eye contact could also be considered a challenging authority. In the Middle East, eye contact between genders is considered inappropriate, although eye contact within a gender could mean honesty and truthfulness.
Being more aware of possible differences in expectations and behaviour can help us avoid cases of bad communication, but it is vital that we also remember that cultural stereotypes can be detrimental to the building of good business relations. Although national cultures could play a role in shaping the way we behave and think, we are also greatly influenced by the region we come from, the communities we associate with, our age and gender, our corporate culture and our individual experiences of the world. Therefore, knowledge of potential differences must be something we have in our minds, rather than something we use to frame individuals of an entire nation.",C1
"Virunga National Park, home to rare mountain gorillas, but targeted for oil exploration by a British company, could earn $400 million a year because of tourism, hydropower and carbon credits, a WWF report said.
But if the UNESCO World Heritage that extends over the equator is exploited for oil, as the Congolese government and SOCO International exploration company expect, it could lead to devastating pollution and permanent conflict in an already unstable region, says the conservation agency.
SOCO International is the only company that seeks to explore within the boundaries of Virunga Park. SOCO insists that its operations in the Congo would be limited to an area in the park known as Block V, and would not affect gorillas.
SOCO President Rui de Sousa said: “Despite WWF’s views, SOCO is extremely sensitive to the environmental importance of Virunga National Park. It is irrefutable that oil companies continue to play a central role in today’s global energy supply and that a successful oil project has the potential to transform the economic and social well-being of an entire country.”
He added: “Unfortunately, the park has been in decline for many years, and has officially fallen below the standards required for a World Heritage site. The development potential could only be the catalyst that reverses this trend.”
However, Raymond Lumbuenamo, director of the Democratic Republic of the Congo at the Kinshassa-based WWF, said security inside and around the park would deteriorate further if SOCO continued its exploration plans.
“The security situation is already bad. The UN is involved with combat units and the M23 rebel force is inside the park. Oil would be a curse. Conflict always increases. It would attract human sabotage. The park could become the Niger Delta. Developing Virunga for oil will do nothing better.
“The population is already very dense, with more than 350 people per square kilometer. When you take part of the land (for oil), you put more pressure on the rest. Oil would not provide many jobs; people would flood in search of work,” he said.
One fear is that the area is seismically active and another eruption of one of the volcanoes in the park could damage the infrastructure of the oil company and lead to oil spills in the lakes. “Virunga’s rich natural resources benefit the Congolese people, not foreign oil seekers. Our country’s future depends on sustainable economic development,” Lumbuenamo said.
“For me, choosing the conservation option is the best option. Once you’ve started drilling for oil, there’s no turning back,” he said.
But Lumbuenamo agreed that while gorillas were safe today, the chances of the park generating its potential of $400m per year were remote. “It would be difficult to make the amount of money the report talks about. Virunga used to be a very quiet place and can be again. The security situation at the moment is bad. The UN is involved with combat units. It’s not as quiet as it used to be.”
According to the WWF report, park ecosystems could support hydropower generation, fishing and ecotourism, and play an important role in safe water supply, climate regulation and soil erosion prevention.
The park, the oldest and most diverse in Africa, houses more than 3,000 different types of animals, but is now heavily populated by desperately poor people, many of whom fled there after the Rwanda massacre in 1994.
“In total, the park could support 45,000 permanent jobs in the region. In addition, people around the world could gain immense value simply knowing that the park is well managed and safe for future generations,” the report says.
“Virunga represents a valuable asset for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and contributes to Africa’s heritage as the continent’s oldest and most biodiverse park,” the report continues. “Plans to explore oil and exploit oil reserves put Virunga’s potential value at risk,” he says.
“This is where we draw the line. Oil companies are at the door of one of the most precious and fragile places in the world, but we will not rest until Virunga is safe from this potential environmental disaster,” said Lasse Gustavsson, executive director of WWF International. “Virunga has snow fields and lava fields, but it should not have oil fields.”
The UNESCO World Heritage Committee called for the cancellation of all Virunga oil permits and appealed to the Total SA and SOCO International plc concessionaires not to conduct explorations at World Heritage sites. Total is committed to respecting Virunga's current limit, leaving UK-based SOCO as the only oil company with plans to explore within the park.

English champions have given permission to the Spanish giants to speak to the World Player of the Year, according to the official United Web site.
United said on Thursday that the wing of Portugal had again expressed its desire to leave Old Trafford, and the club now expects the agreement to be concluded by 30 June.
Madrid confirmed on the club's website that it hoped to seal an agreement with Ronaldo in the coming days.
Real, who has fallen behind Barcelona’s bitter rivals, has slipped to follow the $92 million signature of the Brazilian star Kaka of AC Milan earlier this week. What's your point of view? Tell us what you think of Ronaldo joining Real.
Real also kept the previous record when they paid $77 million - LRB- worth $108 million -RRB- for Zinedine Zidane in 2001.
The president of the club, Florentino Pérez, said after the Kaka agreement was concluded that he would do everything possible to sign the 24-year-old Ronaldo, as he tried to build a new empire that matched his first period in Bernabeu. The 20 most wanted players in the world.
United opposed Real's advances last summer, with manager Alex Ferguson traveling to the Portuguese countryside during the 2008 Euro Cup finals to hold crisis talks with Ronaldo.
The player committed to another season in Manchester, but was affected by injuries at first and, despite an end of the campaign, could not help United to retain the UEFA Champions League title, losing to Barcelona at the end of last month.
Pérez is looking to rebuild a team that finished second in the First League last season, nine points behind Barcelona, and again failed to advance beyond the first knockout stage of Europe's most important club competition.
He failed in his first presidential candidacy in 1995, but won the 2000 elections with the promise to sign Luis Figo de Barca.
Pérez duly brought the Portuguese forward and followed him with a series of budget transfers, including Zidane's and David Beckham's, while creating a team called Galacticos.
United has been linked to moves to sign the French star of Bayern Munich Franck Ribery and the Ecuadorian wing of Wigan Antonio Valencia while Ferguson seeks to replace Ronaldo. Take a look at the latest rumors of transfer and gossip.
Pérez has also expressed interest in bringing Ribery to Spain from Germany.
Ronaldo moved to Old Trafford in August 2003 on a $20 million transfer from Sporting Lisbon just days after scoring against United in a friendly preseason.
He made his first senior outing for the national part that November and helped Manchester United win the FA Cup in May before suffering a headache as Portugal lost to Greece's losers in the 2004 Euro Cup final on homeland.
In November 2005, he agreed on a two-year extension of his contract until 2010.
He was vilified in England in the summer of 2006 after his pranks helped United Wayne Rooney's clubmate be sent as Portugal progressed to the semifinals of the World Cup in Germany.
After the tournament, Ronaldo revealed that he would like to leave United, but at the end of the 2006–07 season the striker agreed to a new five-year contract. Watch CNN about why Ronaldo moved
The following campaign beat the 40-year-old George Best record for goals scored by a partner in a single season, with 33 in the Premier League and 42 in the general standings.
Ronaldo suffered an ankle injury as Portugal lost 3-2 to Germany in the quarterfinals of the Euro 2008, and told the Portuguese newspaper Publico that he would stay with United for at least another year.
In December he was named the best player in Europe, then the following month escaped without suffering injuries after cancelling his sports Ferrari when he crashed into a roadblock under a tunnel near Manchester airport on his way to training. Read it here.
Ronaldo was named FIFA World Player of the Year on January 12 and went on to have the United retain the title of the Premier League, but the club did not become the first to retain the Champions League since its creation in 1992.

"A few months before his death, Carl Sagan recorded a message of hope for potential Mars explorers, telling them: “Whatever the reason you’re on Mars, I’m glad you’re there. And I wish I was with you.
Seventeen years after the pioneering astronomer presented his hopeful vision of the future in 1996, a company from the Netherlands proposes to make Sagan's dreams of reaching Mars a reality. The company, Mars One, plans to send four astronauts on a trip to the Red Planet to establish a human colony in 2023. But there are a couple of serious problems.
First, when on Mars their bodies will have to adapt to the surface gravity that is 38% of that on Earth. It is believed that this would cause such a total physiological change in bone density, muscle strength, and circulation that travelers could no longer survive under Earth conditions. Secondly, and directly related to the first, you will have to say goodbye to all your family and friends, as the agreement does not include a return ticket.
The Mars One website states that a return “cannot be anticipated or expected.” To return, they would need a fully assembled and fed rocket capable of escaping from the gravitational field of Mars, life support systems on board capable of a journey of up to seven months and the ability to dock with a space station in orbit on Earth or perform a safe re-entry and landing. “None of them is a small effort,” says the site, which requires “substantial technical capacity, weight and cost.”
However, the project has already had 10,000 applicants, according to the company's medical director, Norbert Kraft. He told The Guardian that the applicants to date were between 18 and 62 years of age and, although they included women, tended to be men.
The reasons they gave for wanting to go were varied, he said. An American woman named Cynthia, who was 32 years old, told the company that it was a “childish imagination” of her going to Mars. She described a trip that her mother had taken to a conference at the University of Wisconsin in the early 1990s.
He said the professor had been Sagan and asked him if he thought humans would land on Mars in his life. Cynthia said: “He in turn asked me if I wanted to be trapped in a ’tin tin’ spaceship for the two years it would take to get there. I said 'yes', he smiled, and he told me in all seriousness, yes, I absolutely believed that humans would come to Mars in my life.
She told the project: “When I first found out about the Mars One project, I thought, this is my chance – that the childhood dream could become a reality. He could be one of the pioneers, building the first settlement on Mars and teaching people back home that there are still unexplored territories that humans can reach.”
The main attributes Mars One is looking for in sitting astronauts are resilience, adaptability, curiosity, confidence and ingenuity, according to Kraft. They must also be over 18 years of age.
Founded in 2010 by Bas Lansdorp, engineer, Mars One says he has developed a realistic road map and funding plan for the project based on existing technologies and that the mission is perfectly feasible. The website states that the basic elements necessary for life are already present on the planet. For example, water can be extracted from the ice in the soil and Mars has sources of nitrogen, the main element in the air we breathe. The colony will be powered by specially adapted solar panels, he says.
Mars One said he had signed a contract with the U.S. firm Paragon Space Development Corporation to take the first steps in developing the life support system and space suits suitable for the mission.
The project will cost $6 billion, a sum Lansdorp has said it expects to be partially met through the sale of broadcasting rights. “The broadcasting revenue from the London Olympics was almost enough to fund a mission to Mars,” Lansdorp said in an interview with ABC News.
Another ambassador of the project is Paul Römer, co-creator of Big Brother, one of the first and most successful reality TV programs.
On the website, Römer gave an indication of how the project could proceed: “This mission to Mars could be the world’s largest media event,” Römer said. “Reality meets the endless talent contest and everyone is watching.”
The aim is to establish a permanent human colony, according to the company's website. The first team would land on the surface of Mars in 2023 to begin building the colony, with a team of four astronauts every two years after that.
However, the project does not lack its skeptics, and concerns have been raised about how astronauts could reach the planet and establish a colony with all the necessary life support and other requirements.
Professor Gerard’t Hooft, winner of the 1999 Nobel Prize in Theoretical Physics, is the project’s ambassador. T Hooft admits that there are unknown health risks. Radiation is “of a very different nature” from anything that has been tested on Earth, he said.
The mission hopes to inspire generations to “believe that all things are possible, that anything can be achieved,” as well as the landings of Apollo Moon.
“Mars One believes that it is not only possible, but imperative that we establish a permanent settlement on Mars to accelerate our understanding of the formation of the solar system, the origins of life and, of equal importance, our place in the universe,” he says.

"Russell Crowe, born in New Zealand in 1964, is a musician, actor and philanthropist. He has gained considerable success in the film industry. Crowe spent much of his life living in Australia and the United States, but it was in New Zealand that he first became involved in the entertainment industry. As a teenager, Crowe began to develop his musical talent, but found little success. He had several of his songs played on New Zealand radio, but none made the lists. He performed again after moving to Australia, where he appeared in several stage productions, including the Rocky Horror Picture Show. He obtained a role in the television comedy Necinos, and made his film debut in 1990.

Crowe became a popular movie star for her performance in the epic film Gladiator. In the film he portrays a Roman general who is programmed to become a high-ranking officer, but the leader dies, and is replaced by his evil, neurotic son. The new leader fears Crowe's character, and strips him of his rank. He was put into a state of slavery, but becomes a gladiator champion, and leads a revolt against the leader's regime. The film won the Academy Award for Best Film, and Crowe won the Best Actor Award.
He continued his success at Gladiator with a series of highly entertaining films, culminating in the 2001 film A Beautiful Mind. The film follows the life of Nobel Prize winner John Nash. Crowe plays expertly Nash, who is brilliant, but suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. Crowe's performance earned him several awards for Best Actor and Best Oscar for Film. Crowe was also critically acclaimed for his portrayal of the fictional character Captain Jack Aubrey.
Crowe has been generous with his fortune. He has donated money to several cases in his home country, New Zealand, Australia, and the United States.",C1
"The controversial auction of a Banksy mural that disappeared from the wall of a shop in Northern London under mysterious circumstances stopped dramatically moments before it was to fall under the hammer.
Slave Labour, a spray painted artwork depicting a child making the Union flag pay off and viewed as a critical social commentary on last year's diamond jubilee, was expected to be sold for about $700,000 at a street and contemporary art sale in Florida.
But auctioneer Frederic Thut, the owner of the art house of the Miami Fine Arts auction, who had refused all week to disclose the seller's identity or how he became ready for sale through his gallery, announced that the piece, along with a second work by the secret British street artist, had been withdrawn.
It wouldn't give a reason, but the community leaders in Haringey, who led a vocal campaign to stop the sale of the artwork that was imprisoned from the wall of a Poundland in Wood Green, were jubilant.
“One of our two demands was that it doesn’t sell and the other was that we get it back, so we’re halfway there,” said Alan Strickland, Haringey’s councilman.
“I will write to the auction house as a matter of urgency to clarify what happened and what will happen next, but for now we are very happy that because of the pressure and strong opinions of the people of Wood Green, a community campaign in London has had an impact on the United States. It is a real victory for the people.”
Claire Kober, leader of the Haringey Council, wrote to the Arts Council of England and the Mayor of Miami, Tomás Regalado, asking them to intervene to stop the sale, but it seems that the decision to withdraw the article came from the gallery owners in consultation with their lawyers. The FBI refused to confirm the reports they were asked to investigate.
Several hours after the auction was concluded, the auction house issued a brief statement claiming that it had persuaded the owners of the two Banksys to remove them from the sale. “Although there is no legal problem with the sale of lots six and seven by Banksy, FAAM convinced its sellers to withdraw these lots from the auction.”
Nearly 30 potential buyers attended the sale of 106 lots listed in the catalog for the sale of modern, contemporary and street art in the modern Wynwood neighborhood of Miami. The three-hour auction continued with other early lots selling in excess of their order prices.
Critics have accused the auction house of selling stolen goods, but Thut insisted earlier in the week that the seller, whom he described as a “well - known collector, ” was the rightful owner and that the sale was legal.
He added that his gallery had been flooded with emails and phone calls from the United Kingdom, saying that many of them were abusive or offensive, but said he supported the inclusion of parts in the sale because he would preserve them.
The second Banksy to be auctioned, a 2007 work of art entitled Wet Dog that was removed from a wall in Bethlehem and estimated to be worth up to $800,000, disappeared from the online catalog of the auction house at lunchtime on Saturday, but Slave Labor was still on sale until 3pm start time.
Thut said that the two pieces, supplied to him by separate owners, none of them British, were important works on the street art scene and deserved buyers “whose first interest is in art and its preservation. ”
He said he'd keep the collector's privacy for sale. “We respect our customers and their confidentiality. It's not our decision to [Banksy] come back. We just sell it. We don't have control of her.
A spokesman for Poundland said he had no idea who took the 4-foot x 5-foot slab off the side of the tent he rented in Turnpike Lane. Lawyers for the owner of the building, a company called Wood Green Investments Ltd, have refused to confirm whether it had anything to do with the episode.
Banksy himself has not commented on the furor of Slave Labour, but has previously condemned those who have tried to sell their works of art, speaking before the proposed sale of five of their pieces at a 2011 auction in New York. None of them found a buyer.
Stephan Keszler, the distributor behind that auction, believes that selling Banksy's works without his permission is legitimate.
“He does something on other people’s property without asking. The owner of the property can do whatever he wants with it,” Keszler said.

"Brazil's latest funk sensation, Anitta, has won millions of fans by taking the sound of the favela in the main stream, but she is at the center of a debate about skin color.
Anti-discrimination activists and social commentators say the fastest rising star in the music industry has had to sacrifice its blackness to become the predominantly white middle class market.
The controversy was provoked by the publication of photographs of that time and now showing a dramatic lightening of Anitta's skin tone since she signed an agreement with Warner.
In the first, when it was relatively unknown, it seemed darker. In the second – a marketing photo after it became famous – it seems paler. If this was the result of whitening products and aesthetic surgery or – most likely – Photoshop retouching, the contrast has rekindled the discussion about whether it is necessary to be pale to get ahead in Brazil.
Jarid Arraes, a psychology student and blogger, wrote a post criticizing the latent discrimination in the media and marketing that Anitta's makeover felt represented. “People refuse to accept that they are racist and think they live in a multiracial democracy, but statistics show that they are far from the case. Whitening shows us a deeply intolerant society that does not support diversity. White is the image of the rich, the pleasant, the successful, the good, while people see black as the opposite of all that.”
Born Larissa of Macedo Machado, the future diva was a church singer in her childhood. In her adolescence, a name was made on the scene of the funk dance of Rio de Janeiro as a dancer and singer.
It has now exploded into public consciousness with an album and a highly successful single, Show das Poderosas, which topped the charts and attracted 52 million YouTube hits.
Although first worshiped as a pop idol with a strong message and some catchy melodies, its sponsors project it as a cultural bridge between predominantly black and mixed race peoples on the slopes of Rio and the richest and whitest communities below.
He has toned the suggestive dance, the gangsta references and the explicit lyrics of the funk dance. Now, however, questions are being asked about whether she – or her marketing team – have gone too far in redefining her image to attract a more lucrative population. “If pop stars have curly hair, they will feel compelled to straighten it out. If they have a large nose, they will be forced to get rhinoplasty,” Arraes said. “Create a vicious circle for self-esteem.”
This is a delicate issue in this nation largely of mixed races. Brazil, one of the last major countries in the world to ban slavery, has the largest population of African descent outside Africa, but race and descent are less important here than color. And, despite the nation's goal of being a multiracial democracy, there is a clear link between skin tone and inequality.
In Brazilian cities, white workers earn about twice as much as those of African descent. Until 2011, black or mixed students also spent two years less in school on average.
The government says the gap is closing thanks to quota systems for university places and other forms of affirmative action. But the gulf is still obvious. The vast majority of business and government executives are white, while most of the smaller jobs are done by black and mixed-race workers. Stroll through Ipanema, Gávea or other luxury districts and you are much more likely to see black babysitters pushing strollers with white children than a white babysitter pushing a black child.
Defining color is complex. People who defined themselves as white were in the minority for the first time in the most recent census in 2010. Among the 197 million inhabitants, 82 million said they were “pardu” (mixed race), 15 million blacks, 2 million Asians and 0.5% indigenous.
Sylvio Ferreira, professor of psychology at the Federal University of Pernambuco, believes that Anitta has won the hearts of the middle class by taking a rebellious sound and making it tamed and more enjoyable for everyone.
“Was this achieved with racial whitening? No,” he said. “What happened was a change in the social space where Anitta produced her art: from the periphery to the center.”
Others agree that the question of colour is exaggerated. Maycon of Mattos Batista, a financial analyst who worked with Anitta while she was an intern, said there had been a big change in Anitta's image, but not in her color.
“I don’t think it’s whitening; it’s more the way they’re producing it with makeup, stylists and the way it’s dressed,” he said. “I don’t think that was because of the pressure being exerted on her. He always liked to brag, sing and dance. That was a natural thing for her. I think it is because of this naturalness that she is where she is today.”
Leandro Silva de Souza, a racial equality activist in the northeastern city of Salvador, said that prejudice did not lie in society, but in music producers and media executives. The audience, he said, showed that they were interested in music for their own good by choosing Ellen Oléria – a black lesbian – as the recent winner of the The Voice Brazil talent contest.
The Guardian was unable to reach Anitta for comments. But, in a recent interview, he described the need for identity to be self-defined.
“Almighty is a woman who does not need to be beautiful, but has so much attitude that she is wonderful, she is powerful. What I try to convey in my work for everyone is that we can be what we want.”

"Although much of his work, and possibly almost all the best of it, was firmly within the discipline of blues, BB King was always open-minded and interested when found in other environments, bridging musical and cultural differences with affability and skill. Perhaps it’s premature to talk about “the last of the bluesmen,” but it’s hard to imagine any future blues artist pairing King’s influence on musicians by the thousand and the audience by the million in a career spanning 65 years.
Riley B King (the B did not seem to represent a name) was born near Itta Bena, Mississippi and grew up with the limited prospects of an African-American agricultural worker, a barrier that he gradually worked to overcome when he learned the basics of the guitar from a friend of the family and tuned his singing with a quartet of gospel singers. At the age of 20, he moved to Memphis.
In a couple of years, he was playing regularly at a bar in West Memphis, Arkansas. He also became a disc jockey, presenting a program at a Memphis radio station. His billing, “The Beale Street Blues Boy”, was reduced to “Blues Boy King” and from there to “BB”. After a single session in 1949 for a Nashville label, King began recording for the West Coast-based Modern Records in 1950.
It had its first success in 1952, with a dramatic rearrangement of Three O’Clock Blues, who headed the R&B list for 15 weeks; it was the first on a hit list like Please Love Me, You Molest Me Baby and Sweet Sixteen. In these and his dozens of other recordings, most of them his own compositions, King developed an innovative style rooted in the history of blues. He was always willing to praise the musicians who had influenced him and usually mentioned T-Bone Walker first.
“I’ve done everything I can to get that sound,” he told Guitar Player magazine. In an interview in 2001, he said: “If T-Bone Walker had been a woman he would have asked her to marry me,” but he would also quote blues guitarists Blind Lemon Jefferson and Lonnie Johnson and jazz musicians Charlie Christian and Django Reinhardt.
He once explained that his guitar technique was based in part on his lack of skill: “I started folding notes because I could never play bottleneck style, like Elmore James and Booker White. I loved that sound, but I just couldn’t do it.” He was equally self-predating about his singing, a sumptuous blend of honey and lemon, mixed half and half of crooners like Nat King Cole and blues screams like Joe Turner and Dr. Clayton. Probably his favorite composer and singer was Louis Jordan, whose music commemorated on the 1999 album Let the Good Times Roll.
Throughout the 1950s, King was the main blues artist on the black theater and club circuit in an endless one-night series. In 1956, it was supposed to fulfil 342 commitments. In 1962, he tried to change that pattern of work by signing with an important label, ABC, but the first albums under that contract, which he tried to remodel as a pop singer, were as unsatisfactory for his admirers as for ABC accountants.
The 1965 Live at the Regal album, however, demonstrated the durability of King's blues repertoire and has become iconic, a turning point in the early listening of many younger musicians. He had more hits on R&B with blues numbers, including How Blue Can You Get and Paying the Cost to Be the Boss, and, in 1969, he reached the top of the pop charts – where no blues artist had been for many years – with The Thrill Is Gone.
It took him some time to settle down with a rock audience, for which blues was largely defined by the Chicago school of Muddy Waters and Howlin’ Wolf, but was brought to his attention by musicians who admired him. “About a year and a half ago,” he said in 1969, “the kids suddenly started coming to me saying, ‘You’re the best blues guitarist in the world.’ And I would say, 'Who told you that?' And they said, 'Mike Bloomfield' or 'Eric Clapton'. It is to these young people that I owe my new popularity.” He gained more rock credibility with the 1970 Indianola Mississippi Seeds album, in which he collaborated with Carole King and Joe Walsh.
From then on, King was firmly established as “the chairman of the board of blues singers.” Guided by his manager, Sidney Seidenberg, he embarked on international concert tours that took him to Japan, Australia, China and Russia. He also gave concerts to prisoners at Cook County Prison in Chicago and San Quentin, experiences that led to their long participation in rehabilitation programs.
In 1990, King was diagnosed with diabetes and reduced his tour, but not so much so that his followers outside the US. They couldn't catch up with him every year or two. Although he would now hand over most of his sitting act, the strength of his singing and the fluidity of his game were only very gradually diminished. Celebrations for his 80th birthday in 2005 included an award-winning album of collaborations with Clapton, Mark Knopfler, Roger Daltrey, Gloria Estefan and others, tributes by musicians as diverse as Bono, Amadou Bagayoko and Elton John, and a farewell tour that proved not to be a farewell at all.
In 2009, King received a Grammy Award, for the best traditional blues album, for One Kind Favor. In 2012, he performed at a concert at the White House, where U.S. President Barack Obama joined him to sing Sweet Home Chicago. King got married twice and divorced twice. He is survived by 11 children by several companions; four others prejudged him.

"Hillary Clinton sounded a populist tone in a burning campaign appearance on Wednesday, as she continued to reveal a political message before the mid-term elections.
The other side has done everything possible to divide you, he told several thousand Louisville fans. This choice is about the future.
Clinton's speech comes as the former Secretary of State returns to the political sphere with a series of rallies for Democrats in this mid-term cycle. On Wednesday, he gathered supporters of Alison Lundergan Grimes, who is challenging Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell in a high-profile race.
Let's put another crack in the glass ceiling, and choose this amazing young woman for the U.S. Senate, Clinton urged the cheering audience.
Clinton criticized McConnell and Washington politicians for causing stagnation and slowing economic growth, and lamented that the avalanche of money outside the groups is drifting toward the mid-term elections.
He urged the Kentuckians to send a new voice to the Senate.
Some of its larger lines of applause focused on pocket issues such as raising the minimum wage and equal pay.
Isn't it amazing that it's 2014, and we're still debating whether women deserve equal pay for equal work? She asked. If there's only one reason why you're going to vote in the next 20 days, put that on top of the list.
Clinton's visit to Kentucky comes a day after the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee said it would stop posting ads in support of Grimes.
On Thursday, Clinton heads to Michigan to campaign for Senate candidate Gary Peters and Governor Mark Schauer.

"Sometimes life just isn't fair. Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook and is now worth an estimated $48 billion. James Goodfellow also invented something that millions of people around the world used every day, the ATM, but it didn't make him rich. In fact, he won only £10 from the patent and hasn't earned a penny more from it since.
“You can imagine how I feel when I see bankers receiving £1m bonuses. I wonder what contributed more to the banking industry than I did to deserve a £1m bonus. It doesn’t make much sense to me, but that’s the way of the world,” says Goodfellow.
It also bothers him that he is not seen as a good role model for inventors and engineers. He came up with an innovative invention that generated billions of pounds “and I have nothing, so who will want to follow James Goodfellow’s footsteps and get £10 if they have a fantastic success?”
There have been arguments for years about who should officially go down in history as the “inventor of the ATM” and, in 2005, a man named John Shepherd-Barron received an honor from the UK for banking services as the “inventor of the ATM”. However, the British government now says that it was Goodfellow who invented the ATM, so it seems that, after all the disputes, its place in history is now secured.
In the mid-1960s, Goodfellow worked as a development engineer and had been asked to devise a way to allow customers to withdraw money from banks on Saturdays. “Most people who worked during the week could not reach the bank. They wanted a solution. The solution was a machine that would issue cash on demand to a recognized customer,” he recalls. “I set out to develop a cash-emission machine and, for this to be a reality, I invented the PIN [personal identification number] and a coded token associated.”
This token took the form of a plastic card with holes pierced in it. The patent documents proposed a system that incorporated a card reader and buttons mounted on an external wall of the bank and said: “When the customer wishes to remove a package of banknotes from the system, simply insert his perforated card into the card reader of the system and operate the set of ten pushbuttons according to his personal identification number.”
Apart from the punched hole cards, which more or less describes today's ATM. After Goodfellow successfully demonstrated the methodology by producing a model, prototypes were built and the first machines were installed in 1967.
At about the same time, Shepherd-Barron was developing a rival cash distribution device. His machine did not use plastic cards, but checks impregnated with carbon-14, a slightly radioactive substance. The machine detected carbon-14, compared the check to a PIN and paid for the cash.
It is widely accepted that the Shepherd-Barron ATM was the “first in the world” when it comes to being installed and used by the public; the first, in a bank in northern London, was inaugurated on June 27, 1967, a month before Goodfellow ATM made its public debut. However, the patent for Goodfellow's machine was filed on May 2, 1966, 14 months before the London ATM came into service.
The rivalry between the two men bubbled when Shepherd-Barron received an official honor for his achievement. Goodfellow says: “My only great regret is that I never said anything about it until John Shepherd-Barron received the OBE in 2005. This honor was granted on the basis that he was the inventor of the ATM. That really stuck in my throat and ruined a bit of a fuss.” Shepherd-Barron is no longer alive to put his case, but, in a 2005 interview, he was withering quite a bit about his rival: “I don’t know him, but it’s clear that the difference between Goodfellow and us was that we thought through the whole concept of the system and that it was important for the banks that bought it. Your invention reminds me of the hovercraft, an elegant flaw.
The ATM has become a piece of technology that conquers the world and nothing – the contactless revolution, bitcoin, wearable technology, etc. – seems to be slowing down its growth: there are now 3 million ATMs worldwide, with a projected number of 4 million by 2020.
Goodfellow accepts that he did not invent the concept of a cash-emitting machine “but I did invent a way to do it. When people talk about the Wright brothers, they didn’t invent the concept of flying – everyone was trying to do it – but they did and got the credit for inventing the plane, so I think I should get the credit for inventing the ATM.”
The good news for Goodfellow is that this is starting to happen. The ATMInventor.com website concludes: “Who invented the idea of an ATM? We think it was Luther George Simjian. Who invented the ATM as we know it? We have to think it was James Goodfellow in Scotland for having a patent date of 1966. Who invented the ATM design we recognize today? We believe it was John D White for Docutel in the United States.”
Even better for Goodfellow, his achievement has been officially recognized in the latest edition of a 180-page guide called Life in the United Kingdom. In the section on “Great British Inventions of the 20th Century ” he says: “In the 1960s, James Goodfellow (1937-) invented the ATM or cashpoint machine.”
So after all these years, Goodfellow is finally being spoken in the same breath as John Logie Baird (TV), Alan Turing (Turing machine), Sir Frank Whittle (reaction engine) and Sir Tim Berners-Lee (World Wide Web). When asked what he did with the £10 he received in the 1960s, Goodfellow says he thinks he ruined it on a wild night, adding, “It didn’t change my life.” But, he concludes, it has been a good working life: “I was very happy doing the work I was doing.”

"Immigration into the United States is a complicated and controversial issue. Since the founding of the country people have come from different countries in search of a better life and opportunities. However, immigration laws are always changing and complicated. This leads to many people arriving in the United States without adequate legal status. While some people call immigrants coming and staying in the United States ""illegal,"" many find this term offensive. The most acceptable term is ""undocumented"" as they do not have the correct legal documents.

It is estimated that there are more than 11 million undocumented people in the United States. Although some people will say that there is no reason for immigrants to be undocumented in the United States, there are limits on the number of green cards, or legal permanent residence cards, people from certain countries can get. There are also long waiting lists, up to 14 years in some cases, for people coming from certain countries, to apply for legal status in the US. In addition there is a limited amount of visas, or permits, for people coming to the US. with manual work skills. Millions of undocumented people have been deported or returned to their home country under President Obama.
In 2013, the United States Senate passed a immigration reform bill. The law adds additional border security along the U.S.-Mexico border, and also makes it easier for immigrants to become citizens. The bill, which must also be approved by the House of Representatives, has not yet been tabled or voted by Congress. Because of this, many are asking President Obama to take steps to protect some of the undocumented, many of whom have been in the U.S. for many years and have children who are U.S. citizens.",C1

For the French, a federal Europe was the natural progression of the new stability of the bloc.
A collection of like-minded countries whose shared goals were so clear that they would willingly surrender to their own governments for the greater good of the group.
That was 1952. A time when the future had great promises after the horrors of the past and everything seemed possible, even creating a new pseudo country. A place now known as the European Union.
Fast forward to this day and, although the EU has some shared governing bodies, such as a committee and a parliament, it is certainly not the whole of the United States that Monnet expected. Those with the same deeply rooted convictions and beliefs.
The glue that held their common ideologies was unleashed with the fall of the Berlin Wall.
Since then, a crisis between countries sharing the euro has reopened old wounds. Ironically, instead of uniting nations, their finances have threatened to destroy them.
This leaves us with a fundamental question: if the main task of the EU is no longer to provide peace, nor can it guarantee prosperity, then what should its role be?
Born from the ashes of Europe's turbulent past, the EU has achieved much for its members.
It has taught its citizens the value of commitment to violence, providing protection and strength in number.
It has increased prosperity thanks to the free movement of goods and labour caused by the single market, while the rights of consumers and workers have been strengthened and their health improved through the ban on smoking.
But the EU has also moved away from its original concept, its ranks swollen by a massive bureaucratic machine based in Brussels that, according to critics, is suffocating the industry and pushing members like the UK into the exit door.
The borders of the bloc have doubled with its endless absorption of former communist countries, extending the definition of Europe to its limits, making membership of this former elite club more a useful tool of foreign policy than an appreciated vision.
The EU faces a constant challenge that meets the expectations of its citizens and without two-tier policies has no hope of serving both the strong and weak economies of the bloc.
The EU needs a new vision of a new project for which its citizens can feel passionate.
And where else to start then this week's fundamental parliamentary elections.

"For a traditional master navigator like Tua Pittman from Raratonga in the Cook Islands, a canoe is much more than a means of transportation. “The canoe is our island, the crew are the community and the navigator is the leader,” Pittman says. He goes on to explain that the opposite is also true. “An island is our canoe, the community is the crew members and the politicians and leaders are the sailors. In a canoe, you don't just go from one destination to another using the stars, the moon, the sun and the birds. Navigation is using the philosophies of being a leader to show its crew members the light of life.”
It has been a whirlwind week for the crews of the flotilla of four sailing canoes since they arrived in Sydney for the start of the World Park Congress. Tua's trip began in the Cook Islands on September 25. The first stage led the islanders to Samoa, then Fiji, Vanuatu and the Gold Coast, before heading south to Sydney. About 100 crew members participated in the various stages of the journey and their objective was to travel using only traditional navigation techniques. Unfortunately, Tua said, crews were forced to rely on modern navigational equipment sometimes to arrive in Australia in time for Congress.
The official title of the expedition is Mua Voyage and is a partnership between the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Oceania Regional Office and five Pacific island countries: Samoa, Tonga, New Zealand, Cook Islands and Fiji. The main objective of the 6,000-nautical-mile journey (11,000 km) was to convey a special message to the World Park Congress.
In part, the message read: “We see the signs of overexploitation. We no longer see fish and other marine creatures in the size, diversity, or abundance of the past. We are witnessing change as foreign fishing fleets fill our waters in a race to strip us of our resources. Our coral reefs, the largest in the world, and our mangroves and wetlands are disappearing. Our ocean is vast but not unlimited. The growing world population and the relentless pursuit of unsustainable development are reducing our ocean’s ability to sustain life.”
Despite the effort and urgency behind the Pacific Islander's message to congressional delegates, much of the last days of the Marine side of Congress were taken with an attempt to set a revised target for the amount of the ocean that needs to be protected in marine sanctuaries. According to IUCN, as of 2013, the number of world oceans in marine protected areas was not even three percent and less than one percent of that is ‘no take’. This was despite a target of 20-30% of exclusion zones established by the last World Park Congress in South Africa in 2003.
Professor Callum Roberts of the University of York was one of the scientists who helped set the target of 20-30% in 2003. But he said it wasn't enough. “IUCN should now raise its target from 30 to 33%. The new investigation reinforces the argument for the 30% target set earlier to be raised now. Any reduction in efforts at this stage and time in history would be disastrous for our oceans.”
After difficult negotiations, the delegates of the World Park Congress approved a motion that will dramatically change the objectives for global marine management. Instead of the 20-30% aspiration goal, the new official position of IUCN is “to urgently increase the ocean area that is effectively and equitably managed in environmentally representative and well-connected systems of marine protected areas or other effective conservation measures by 2030; these should include strictly protected areas that represent at least 30 per cent of each marine habitat and address both biodiversity and ecosystem services”.
Tua Pittman was delighted with the news that a strong resolution on the planet's oceans had passed Congress. “It’s like a big reward for all the effort we made to be here and be heard. Listening to what they did to that resolution is fantastic. It is a step in the right direction.” He says that, while many of the traditional navigational aids were things like the sun, the moon and the stars that never changed and that, at least on a human scale, would always be there, other impacts of environmental degradation were becoming clearer by sailing the Pacific.
He said he was 55 years old and, in his life, he was already beginning to see that it was much harder to fish in the open sea. He also said that pollution was getting worse, particularly as canoes approached big cities like Sydney. And the effects of climate change were already beginning to seriously affect Pacific Islanders. “The decisions of large countries have two, three, four times the impact on small countries than on large developed nations. Many times, people don’t even know where our islands are and, from the eyes of a traditional navigator, our people have a very, very deep concern because we’re talking about decisions taken away from that impact on our homes.”
Mua Voyage had been a massive logistics company, Tua said. Years of preparation and navigation planning went on such a journey and it was critical for travelers that the world listen to their message and act. The leaders of the rich countries, he continued, need to start thinking more like traditional sailors who recognize their ships are mere stains on a huge sea. Most importantly, and speaking as a true navigator, Tua says that politicians must look for a different route to avoid the pending ecological crises that are beginning to overtake small island nations. “The world needs to find a different path.”

"A
Thanks to the field of linguistics we know a lot about the development of the 5,000 more languages that exist today. We can describe your grammar and pronunciation and see how your spoken and written forms have changed over time. For example, we understand the origins of the Indo-European language group, which includes Norwegian, Hindi and English, and can trace them to tribes in Eastern Europe at about 3000 BC.
Therefore, we have traced a large part of the history of language, but there are still areas of which we know little. Experts are beginning to look into the field of evolutionary biology to find out how the human species developed in order to use language. So far, there are many more questions and a half theories than answers.
B
We know that human language is much more complex than that of our closest and intelligent relatives like chimpanzees. We can express complex thoughts, transmit subtle emotions and communicate on abstract concepts such as the past and the future. And we do this by following a set of structural rules, known as grammar. Only humans use an innate system of rules to govern the order of words? Perhaps not, as some research may suggest that dolphins share this ability because they are able to recognize when these rules are broken.
C
If we want to know where our capacity for complex language comes from, we need to see how our brains are different from other animals. This relates to something more than the size of the brain; it is important what other things our brains can do and when and why they evolved that way. And for this there are very few physical clues; the artifacts left by our ancestors do not tell us what discourse they were able to make. One thing we can see in the remains of the first humans, however, is the development of the mouth, throat, and tongue. About 100,000 years ago, humans had developed the ability to create complex sounds. Before that, evolutionary biologists can only guess if the first humans communicated using more basic sounds.
D
Another question is, what does the human brain have that allowed language to evolve in a way that it did not in other primates? At some point, our brains became able to make our mouths produce vocal and consonant sounds, and we developed the ability to invent words to name things around us. These were the basic ingredients for a complex language. The next change would have been to put those words into sentences, similar to those used by children as they learn to speak for the first time. No one knows whether the next step – adding grammar to point out past, present and future, for example, or plurals and relative clauses – required further development in the human brain or was simply a response to our increasingly civilized way of living together.
Between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, however, we began to see the evidence of early human civilization, through cave paintings, for example; no one knows the connection between this and language. Brains didn't suddenly get bigger, yet humans became more complex and smarter. Was it the use of language that made your brains develop? Or did your more complex brains start producing language?
E
More questions arise when examining the influence of genetics on brain development and language. Are there genes that mutate and give us the ability of language? Researchers have found a genetic mutation that occurred between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago, which seems to have a connection to talking and how our brains control our mouth and face. Monkeys have a similar gene, but did not undergo this mutation. It's too early to tell how much influence genes have in language, but one day the answers might be found in our DNA.",C1
"They are the seekers of darkness – and they are growing in number. At Black Fell, looking down at Northumberland's beautiful Kielder water reservoir, a group of people wait in a parking lot next to a strange wooden building with a minimalist design with rays of the future. This is the Kielder Observatory, the center of the nascent British astroturistic industry. And the ones waiting outside were the lucky ones. Many more had requested a star observation night at the observatory, but the numbers are strictly limited.
Inside, next to a wood burner and under dimmed lights, the observatory's founder and main astronomer, Gary Fildes, a former Tarzan-haired mason, offers a talk of encouragement to his colleagues and volunteers. The team discusses the prospect of seeing the Northern Lights, but Fildes is doubtful. Instead, they decide to train their powerful telescopes on Jupiter and Venus and later choose stars such as Capella and Bethelgeuse. An additional attraction is the emergence of the International Space Station.
“Remember,” Fildes tells his team, “it’s about interaction, it’s about entertainment, it’s about inspiring people.” Pink Floyd, the Jam, the Pogues. “By 9.30, the sky is going to be sexy,” Fildes says. “It’s going to be epic.”
Fildes, 49, is at the forefront of the UK's flourishing astrotourism industry. The crucial moment for Northumberland came in 2013 when the entire national park that houses the Adriano Wall, along with Kielder Water and Forest Park, about 1,500 km2, was awarded the status of Dark Sky Park, the only one in England. Dark Sky Parks are rare. The 2013 Star Count revealed that only 5% of the UK population can see more than 31 stars on a good night.
The Dark-Sky International Association (IDA) based in Tucson, Arizona, confers status only to places that take important steps to prevent light pollution. The receivers must also prove that their night skies are dark enough. In Northumberland Dark Sky Park, as the area was renamed, it is so dark that Venus casts a shadow on Earth.
Duncan Wise, a visitor development officer at the Northumberland National Park Authority, helped lead the campaign for dark sky status after the Council for Rural England Protection found it to be one of Britain's quietest places. “We tend to see the landscape as everything to the horizon,” Wise said. “But what about what is above?” Sabio and others spent years preparing their submission to the IDA, collecting resumes of light readings and forming an alliance of local councils, park bodies and community groups to produce a master plan of outdoor lighting that influences the construction of new developments in the area.
Their efforts have been vindicated. Many of the 1.5 million visitors to Northumberland each year are now aware of their Dark Sky status. “We have a lot of people coming here to see the sky now,” says the man from the car rental company in Newcastle. “They come in autumn and winter, when it is darker. Good for B&Bs as they have business throughout the year.” Local hoteliers now emit guests with night vision torches and put sun loungers at night. Those who have acquired some knowledge of astronomy can receive a badge confirming that their hotels are “Dark Sky Friendly”.
Wise recognizes that Northumberland needs to do more to capitalize on its scarce resources and believes that the region needs a couple more observatories to make sure visitors see what they are looking for. A £14 million national landscape discovery center, which he describes as the northern response to Project Eden, will have an observatory when completed in a couple of years.
Fildes has great designs. He is planning Britain’s first “astrovillage”, which would house the world’s largest public observatory and feature a 100-seat auditorium, a 100-seat planetarium, a one-metre aperture telescope, and radio and solar telescopes. The multi-million-pound project would have a hotel and attract 100,000 people per year, four times the current number of people able to use the observatory. Fildes is cryptic about his sponsors, but believes that astrovillage will be a reality for 2018.
However, Northumberland faces competition. Galloway Forest Park in Scotland also has the status of Dark Sky Park. Since Exmoor was designated the first International Dark Sky Reserve in Europe – a notch below Dark Sky Park – in 2011, a series of local businesses have emerged that offer breaks and safaris. The United Kingdom will have to go somehow to eclipse northern Chile, which has more than a dozen tourist observatories and has some of the clearest skies in the world. The Teide National Park in Tenerife is also becoming an important destination for astrotourism.
So what is driving the desire to look up? The media has helped. Television presenters like Brian Cox have attracted a new generation of stargazers. “Brian Cox has made astronomy accessible,” Wise says. “It is no longer seen as the province of professors in studies with brass telescopes.” Technology has also played a role. Applications like Stellarium now turn smartphones into pocket planetariums. Ultimately, however, Fildes believes that people are beginning to appreciate what is above. “If you had to build a visitor attraction from scratch, what could be better than the universe?”

"Organic foods have more antioxidant compounds linked to better health than regular foods, and lower levels of toxic metals and pesticides, according to the most comprehensive scientific analysis to date. The international team behind the work suggests that switching to organic fruits and vegetables could bring the same benefits as adding a portion or two of the recommended ""five a day.""
The team, led by Professor Carlo Leifert of the University of Newcastle, concludes that there are “significant and significant statistics” differences, with a range of antioxidants “substantially superior” – between 19% and 69% – in organic foods. It is the first study to show clear and wide-ranging differences between organic and conventional fruits, vegetables, and cereals.
Researchers claim that the increase in antioxidant levels is equivalent to “one or two of the five portions of fruits and vegetables recommended for daily consumption and would therefore be significant and significant in terms of human nutrition, if the information linking these compounds to the health benefits associated with increased consumption of fruits, vegetables and whole grains is confirmed.”
The findings will add to the controversy about organic foods and if it is better for people, with an expert saying that the findings were exaggerated. Tom Sanders, professor of nutrition at King’s College in London, said the research showed some differences. “But the question is, are they within natural variation? And are they nutritionally relevant? I’m not convinced.” He said that Leifert's work had caused controversy in the past. “Leifert has had many disagreements with many people.” Sanders added that research showed that organic cereals have less protein than conventional crops.
The research results are based on an analysis of 343 peer-reviewed studies from around the world – more than ever – examining the differences between organic and conventional fruits, vegetables, and cereals. “The crucial thing about this research is that it breaks the myth that the way we grow does not affect the quality of the food we eat,” said Helen Browning, executive director of the Soil Association, who is campaigning for organic farming.
Plants produce many of their antioxidant compounds to fight pest attacks, so higher levels in organic crops can result from their lack of protection by chemical aerosols. But scientists say that other reasons can be important, such as organic varieties that are raised for tenacity and are not supercharged with artificial fertilizers.
Leifert and his colleagues conclude that many antioxidants “have previously been linked to a lower risk of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers.” But they also note that there have been no long-term studies showing health benefits from a broad organic diet. Researchers found much higher levels of cadmium, a toxic metal, in conventional crops. Pesticide residues were found in conventional crops four times more often than in organic foods. The research was funded by the EU and an organic farming charity.
The research will surely be criticized: the inclusion of so many studies in the analysis could mean that poor quality work biases the results, although the team performed “sensitivity analysis” and found that excluding the weakest work did not significantly change the result. Moreover, the highest levels of cadmium and pesticides in conventional products remained well below regulatory limits. But researchers say that cadmium accumulates over time in the body and that some people may want to avoid this, and that the limits of pesticides are set individually, not for cocktail chemicals used in crops.
Another criticism is that the differences observed may be the result of different climates, soil types and crop varieties, and not organic farming, although researchers argue that combining many studies should average these other differences. The biggest criticism, however, will be about suggestions for potential health benefits. The most recent main analysis, which took 223 studies in 2012, found little evidence. “The published literature lacks solid evidence that organic foods are significantly more nutritious than conventional foods,” he found.
This was also the conclusion of earlier and smaller studies published in 2009 in a scientific journal and by the Food Standards Agency of the United Kingdom, although the latter considered only 11 studies. The 2012 study noted that eating organic foods could help people avoid pesticide residues. Sanders said he wasn't convinced by the new job. “You won’t be better nourished if you eat organic food,” he said. “The most important thing is what you eat, not whether it’s organic or conventional. It's if you eat fruits and vegetables at all. People are buying into a lifestyle system. They are confident that it is not being grown with chemicals and is not cultivated by large companies.”
Opinion polls show healthy eating (55%) and avoiding chemical residues (53%) are key reasons cited by buyers for buying organic products. However, many also say that environmental care (44%) and animal welfare (31%) are important, as is taste (35%). Browning said: “This research supports what people think about organic foods. In other countries, much higher levels of support and acceptance of the benefits of organic food and agriculture have long been recorded. We hope that these results will bring the UK in line with the rest of Europe.”

"From choosing the right festival to tips for camping and going through the shows, here you have -LRB- almost -RRB- everything you need to know about getting ready for your next music festival.
When I went to my first summer music festival a few years ago, I wasn't ready and I could have used a little guide. Since then, I have covered Lollapalooza, Pitchfork Music Festival, moe.down and other summer festivals, acquiring along the way a list of things I wish I had had before embarking on the first.
Experienced veteran or festival novice, I hope these tips will make your experience more rocking, relaxing and fun.
Find the right festival for you
One of the best places to start is Jambase.com, an aggregator of all things related to music festivals and concerts. Take a look at the history of each particular festival through its website or third-party music blogs/sites.
Each festival tries to differentiate itself, creating a specific inclination through alignment, location and general atmosphere. In general, the festivals will unite with local and regional media and artists to offer unique parallel shows ranging from improvisational theatre to art exhibitions, record shops and campaigners' booths promoting voter registration and ecological initiatives.

When doing your research, ask yourself the following four questions:
1. How much can you spend?
Festival passes range from $50 to $250 or more, depending on the location, location, and who is leading and promoting the festival.
2. What kind of music do you want to hear?
The musical tastes are quite diverse these days, as most people enjoy various genres, and festival formations reflect this. Although some are unique in genre, most of the show shows play everything, from bluegrass to hip hop.
3. Are you ready to camp?
For festivals like Bonnaroo and Coachella, much of the experience consists of launching your tent and camping during the weekend. Some camping events offer luxury cabins or tents in exchange for higher prices.
Home page: What is Bonnaroo?
Most festivals provide maps before arrival, so you want to know where the camping areas are related to the parking and stages. If the distance is far, try to keep your equipment light or invest in a small traction car or cart.
Depending on how much sleep you want to sleep or how close you want to be to the action -LRB- many festivals run 24 hours -RRB-, you want to know if the campsites are close to the stages, scattered over the grounds, or both.
Bring the usual camping equipment -- shop, sleeping bag, etc. -- and don't forget a car charger for your phone, laptop and other gadgets.
The best music festivals in the world
4. Are hotels an option?
If you are attending a festival located in a city or metropolitan area, such as Pitchfork in Chicago, getting a hotel room for the weekend on your own is an option, or you can take advantage of the festival's accommodation offers.
Learn the local story before you leave
As with all trips, having a cultural awareness of where you're going can enrich your festival experience and take you beyond the simple enjoyment of music. The uniqueness of many of the best festivals is rooted in its locality. For example, Glastonbury in the UK is held on the basis of festivals that have been used as such for centuries.
Being informed about local culture and history will also help if you plan to venture during the show to give your ears a break or want to make a pre or post-festival excursion to visit nearby attractions.
Stretch out your comfort zone
One of the best parts of the summer music festival experience is watching the mix of different cultures and being around new groups of people. As more and more festivals incorporate different genres, I have seen an increasingly diverse cross section of fans in festivals.
Take the opportunity to interact with other festival attendees, and don't be afraid to order the camping tool you forgot. Talk about last night's set or join a Frisbee game.

Be smart about drugs and alcohol
I don't include this advice to be a party pooper, but only as a word of caution. I've seen festival experiences come to an early and nightmare ending as a result of irresponsible drug and alcohol consumption.
It is a fact that the culture of music and drug culture overlap, especially in a live music environment, but be wise about bringing drugs or large amounts of alcohol with you. In most festivals, you're going to be thoroughly searched before you even get through the doors. Security will confiscate the prohibited materials or ask you to leave without refund of tickets.

Make time to relax.
One of the biggest lessons I've learned is to plan a few break intervals and not run back trying to see each band. If you've done an initial investigation into the area, make a short trek to one of the quiet places you learned from and give your cochleas a break.
Many festivals have also started with morning yoga classes, a great opportunity to recharge the mind and body.
I cannot emphasize this enough: whatever you do, either reading a book, taking a nap, or taking a diary in a quiet place, make time to give your ears and other senses a break. Knowing the design of the festival and programming in time to relax is the most important advice I can give.

"Mrs Sally Davies, medical director of England, has compared the problem of antibiotic resistance to the risks posed by international terrorism. Although this might sound like an exaggeration, the threat was in fact, in any case, underestimated. Every year, the global number of deaths to which bacterial resistance contributes far exceeds those caused by terrorist attacks.
While it is difficult to monitor the global impact of antibiotic resistance on all bacterial species, the World Health Organization estimates that for tuberculosis alone multidrug resistance causes more than 150,000 deaths each year. Antibiotic resistance is no longer an abstract risk: it is now a war.
Over the past hundred years, our life and survival expectations have changed beyond recognition. At the beginning of the twentieth century, life expectancy in the United Kingdom was about 47 years for a man and 50 years for a woman, a number greatly affected by the very high infant mortality rate in those days. About one third of all deaths occurred in children under five years of age, mainly due to infectious diseases.
On the other hand, a child born in Britain today has a better chance of turning 100. That is why we have to thank the public health systems, vaccination and antibiotics. It is by these means – the prevention and treatment of diseases caused by microorganisms – that the real war against diseases is mainly won.
In other places, we have pushed the limits of survival, especially in intensive care. This, the specialism in which I chose to train, is where antibiotic-resistant organisms are most prevalent. In this case, potent antibiotics, essential in the treatment of life-threatening diseases, are routinely used. These drugs decimate common bacteria. But what they leave behind are resistant species that have begun to learn tricks that allow them to evade antibiotics.
As a newly qualified physician in the late 1990s, I learned about Staphylococcus Aureus, the infamous MRSA, a bacterial species resistant to methicillin and all other penicillins. In the fight against it, there were a handful of exotic sound drugs - vancomycin and theicoplanin among them. These were supposed to be our last lines of defense, but antibiotic-resistant bacteria became more and more common; just like species with new resistance patterns. The drugs we had barely heard of became commonplace. New last-line drugs emerged to replace the old ones. We used to this state of affairs; a constant escalation in the arms race between us and the bacteria.
But the balance has been constantly changing. In our hospitals and our GP surgeries we have abused drugs that gave us a huge advantage over infectious diseases, using them too often and indiscriminately. And some of the worst abuses have occurred outside health care, with antibiotics introduced into the food chain, through agriculture and the burden of feeding livestock with antibacterial drugs. We assumed antibiotic therapy was an advantage we could enjoy forever. We were convinced that the pharmaceutical industry would continue to advance the game.
But it's not like that anymore. New, more resistant species have been identified. The vancomycin we used to trust to treat MRSA infection was defeated. Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (VRSA) emerged in our hospitals. And other bacterial species were learning the same trick. Enterobacteria, which are usually found in the intestine, had also acquired resistance to vancomycin. Today, infections with formidable and highly resistant organisms are common and the pharmaceutical industry does not keep pace. Fewer and fewer new antimicrobial drugs come out of their production lines. It is becoming increasingly difficult to develop new active drugs against resistant strains. For every method of attack that pharmaceutical companies invent, bacteria rapidly evolve a defense. All simple approaches to the problem have been exhausted.
Antibiotics have become expensive drugs to develop, which are only used in short courses and which quickly become ineffective due to the evolution of bacterial resistance. As a result, the incentive of the pharmaceutical industry to manufacture new drugs that can combat them is low.
Almost as soon as antibiotic use became widespread in the 1940s, the first evidence of bacterial resistance to antimicrobial therapy emerged. Initially, these were little more than curiosities. When the patients were infected, the numbers were so small that at first they were not enough to deserve much attention. But today, they have become a fact of medical life. Less than a century after the discovery of penicillin, we are beginning to lose the fight.
Since the first deaths of MRSA in healthy children in the U.S. in 1998, the number of deaths due to MRSA infection in the US. has increased to tens of thousands each year, exceeding the number of deaths caused by AIDS. Bacterial resistance in hospitals is everywhere. This is a war like no other. There needs to be a cultural change in our prescribing behaviour and greater restraint in the use of antibiotics in agriculture and agriculture. And somehow, pharmaceutical companies have to be convinced to pursue the development of these less profitable drugs.
During my working life, the pattern of antibiotic resistance in medical care has evolved from a rare but noticeable event to an epidemic-proportion problem. If we want to avoid a return to pre-antibiotic time with all its excess mortality, we must be bold. Deploying the advantage we have gained so recently against microorganisms in the struggle for life would be unthinkable.",C1
"On a day in August, one in seven people on Earth, a billion people, used Facebook, according to founder Mark Zuckerberg. In a decade, the social network has transformed people's relationships, privacy, their businesses, the media, helped overthrow regimes and even changed the meanings of everyday words.
“A more open and connected world is a better world.
It brings stronger relationships with those you love, a stronger economy with more opportunities and a stronger society that reflects all our values,” Zuckerberg wrote in the post announcing the numbers. These are just some of the ways your company changed everything, for better or for worse.
1 Facebook has changed the definition of “friend”
“To the Friend” is now a verb. And, unlike real life, when the end of a friendship can be deeply traumatic, it is easy to “not be friends,” a word invented to describe the abandonment of a casual acquaintance when they are no longer improving their Facebook news source. Although the meanings of the words “share” and “like” are essentially the same, Facebook has brought a whole new weight to the terms. School and college meetings have become redundant – you know whose career is going well, if the perfect couple has split up and you've seen endless pictures of your schoolmates' babies. You won't be surprised by an ex on the street with a new girlfriend or boyfriend: you know they're dating someone else from the romantic selfies.
But, unlike real life, Facebook has no hierarchy of friendships. A classmate of a college project you haven't seen in 15 years, a friend-of-a-friend of a deer or a colleague you've never really talked to in person – they're all Facebook friends the same way your closest partner or your spouse or your mother.
It does not necessarily mean that we see them in the same way. Professor Robin Dunbar is famous for his research suggesting that a person can only have about 150 people as a social group. Facebook hasn't changed that yet, he believes, but, in an interview with New Yorker, Dunbar said he feared it would be so easy just to end friends on Facebook that eventually there might no longer be a need to learn how to get along.
2 We care less about privacy
There is a wise saying: if you are not paying for it, you are the product. Facebook embodies that philosophy and created an entire industry from it. The amazing thing is that users know it and that they voluntarily deliver that information.
Pew Research Center found that most young people are more than willing to give their details.
An overwhelming majority of 91% publish a photo of themselves, 71% publish the city or town where they live, more than 61%, more than half give email addresses and a fifth give their phone number. But, as much of a person's life is shared online, Facebook offers a platform for everyone to cultivate an image and a fan base. In an article in Frontiers in Psychology, scholars described a new phenomenon, the emergence of “I Facebook. ” More than 80% list their interests, allowing brands to address them in the most effective way. But most younger users restrict their profiles, with 60% allowing only friends.
3 Facebook has created millions of jobs – but not in their own offices
Facebook has essentially created an entire sector, including indirect employment for people whose job it is to make the platform work for their brand.
“It’s a tool like no other,” said Michael Tinmouth, a social media strategist who has worked with brands like Vodafone and Microsoft. “Markers have an understanding of consumers of a brand like they’ve never had before. The data and analysis available to you are extraordinary. You know who your customers are, who they are friends with and how they get involved with your brand.”
And advertisers pay a lot for that. Facebook reported that advertising revenue increased by 46%, reaching $3.320 million. Facebook is also a minefield for brands. Suddenly, instead of complaining about conversations that take place over the phone with a customer service representative or on a small specialized Internet forum, angry customers can post their complaints to hundreds of their friends to see or even on the page where all loyal brand fans have been carefully cultivated. And an injustice can go viral.
4 Facebook has been the tool to organize revolutions
Although the Arab Spring was nicknamed the Twitter revolution, the organization of demonstrations and direct actions has been revolutionized by Facebook. Olga Onuch of Manchester University discovered that Facebook had been the key means to reach half of all Euro-Maid protesters in Ukraine. Facebook posts pointed to the beginning of Maidan protests during the hours after it was announced that Ukraine would not sign a free trade and association agreement with the EU, Onuch found. Posts organized live action, not just online anger. Mustafa Nayyem, the Ukrainian activist, published: “If you really want to do something, don’t like this post. Let us meet near the monument to independence in the middle of the Maidan.
Many of those interviewed in Onuch's research said they trusted Facebook for the truth about what was happening – unable to trust traditional media.
5 Facebook makes news, gives news and decides what is news
Approximately 71 per cent of 18-24 year olds say the Internet is their main source of news and 63 per cent of users in general, according to the Pew Research Center. About a third of Facebook users post about politics and government.
Most people will first encounter a piece of journalism or a last-minute article via Facebook or other social media, and most of those encounters will be on mobile.
Users may never have to leave the site to get their news: Instant Articles will see stories executed within Facebook. It allows news companies to sell ads around their articles, earning them 100% of that revenue, while Facebook can also sell ads around that article, with 70% of the advertising revenue from the social network also going to news companies.
Facebook has also changed the way journalists write stories. It's a resource that many reporters can't live without now. For better or (often) worse, it is a directory to find, contact and collect information for almost any ordinary person, who could suddenly be at the center of the biggest news of the day. Facebook has its own news cable, sharing users' most useful reaction to last-minute stories, including photos and videos.
6 Users are Changing Facebook
It used to be a place to connect students, with only elite U.S. universities. allowed access.
In 2014, a decade after its launch, 56% of Internet users over the age of 65 have a Facebook account. And 39% are connected to people they've never met in person.
The groups have given way to pages, writing on the walls of others is out of fashion and carefully curated albums have given way to instant mobile loads. More than ever, the site is a gateway not only to your friends, but to the rest of the Internet.
We can also get used to it, said David Kirkpatrick, author of The Facebook Effect. “It may go further along the way, but something this big takes a long time to disappear,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today. “Facebook has demonstrated its ability to change and will remain a very, very important player.”

"On June 17, 1964, President Lyndon Johnson explained to New York Times reporter James Scotty Reston why he had to stay in Vietnam stabilizing the government of South Vietnam so he could fight communism.
Johnson rejected the calls for withdrawal being made by the Liberal Democrats, as well as the proposal for neutralization promoted by Frenchman Charles de Gaulle.
So all you have left, Johnson said, is to try to make this thing more efficient and more effective and keep it as strong as you can and keep this government as stable as you can and try to improve it as you can and we're doing it day and night.
During his recent speech at West Point, President Obama rejected the lessons that these kinds of stories tell us about Afghanistan. The president, saying that the comparison with Vietnam is based on a false reading of history, pointed out three differences.
The first is that the United States is now part of a broad international coalition. The second is that in Vietnam the U.S. faced a broad-based popular insurgency, while today, according to most polls, a large number of Afghans support foreign assistance. Finally, Obama added, is that today Americans are responding to a very real threat that began with the September 11 vicious attack.
Clearly, Obama feels defensive about this analogy and hopes to undermine liberal critics who are frustrated and disappointed with his decision.
However, in trying to break away from Johnson’s experience, Obama did not give an accurate account of what many commentators have been saying recently, and he lowered crucial aspects of the 1960s that actually offer warnings for today.
Mark Twain once said that history does not repeat itself, but rhymes. Most of those who have compared Afghanistan to Vietnam do not say that the situations were exactly the same from a political or strategic point of view. Nor is it inevitable that the increase in Afghanistan will be fruitless.
The point of comparison is that it is impossible to ignore the fact that Obama faces similar challenges, as Johnson did when Vietnam's Americanization began in the spring of 1965.
Both presidents entered the war despite the fact that many high-level advisers in the White House and Congress were strongly warning against the escalation.
In 1964, Johnson heard from voices ranging from the Frank Liberal Church of Idaho to Georgia's hawk Richard Russell that Vietnam was not critical of fighting communism and that war was invincible. Their warnings turned out to be accurate. In making this decision, Obama also heard comparable criticisms.
Both presidents also expanded the war just as they were trying to shape a broad internal agenda. Johnson was much ahead of the game when he increased the number of ground troops in the war he inherited. The war devastated Johnson's domestic efforts. Obama faces the same threat.
Both wars have been justified as wars of necessity. With Vietnam, advocates warned that the fall of Southeast Asia to communism would greatly strengthen the Soviet Union and China.
At a time when American schoolchildren were being taught to hide and cover under their desks in the event of nuclear war, this warning about Vietnam also made war seem essential. Today, the need arises from the assertion that failure would resurrect the dangers we face before 11 September.
And both presidents intensified wars where the road to victory and possible costs -- in terms of human capital and budgetary obligations -- were unclear.
Despite the fact that Johnson faced a very different type of enemy, the risk today is enormously high. In Afghanistan, the U.S. is dealing with a war front that is notoriously treacherous, as the Soviets learned in the 1980s and the U.S. has learned since 2001. The U.S. also relies on a highly corrupt and unreliable government in Afghanistan.
Although the promise of withdrawal in July 2011 could be accurate, presidential guarantees of benchmarks and final games are historically not realized. The only constant in the war is that it is unpredictable and difficult to control. One day after Obama's speech, Defense Secretary Robert Gates indicated that the deadline was not firm.
And the administration could very well be espousing a strategy of more war, as it continues to offer serious warnings about what a victory for the Taliban would mean.
These warnings will make it difficult in the long term for the administration to contain the operation or withdraw forces unless it is absolutely clear that the Taliban have been defeated.
Democrats might feel like their predecessors in the 1950s who were under political pressure to abide by the contentions outlined by President Harry Truman with the Truman Doctrine in 1947, first with Korea in 1950 and then with Vietnam.
Obama should not be so defensive about comparisons with Vietnam. Rather, you should use Johnson's experience to help guide you as you make crucial decisions in the coming months and try to navigate the challenges of the presidency in times of war.
In a conversation with some of his closest advisors, Johnson said in 1964 that it's fucking easy to get into a war, but it'll be very hard to get out of yourself if you come in.
In 1965, Johnson made the mistake of excluding those who tried to warn him of the dangers of war. Let's hope this time around Obama doesn't repeat this mistake.
The views expressed in this commentary are only those of Julian Zelizer.

"The swimming superstar Michael Phelps once claimed that he mocked up to 12,000 calories a day. Yohan Blake, the great opponent of Usain Bolt's sprint, says he sucks 16 ripe bananas every 24 hours.
A small Japanese athlete easily hid 50 pieces of sushi after training, while another marathon runner swallowed raw minced meat dishes.
Or what about the weightlifter who drinks the first milk from a cow he just gave birth to?
With extreme eating habits like these, it can be a surprise to know that inside the Olympic Village lies a culinary trap that can potentially tip athletes over the fine line between success and failure in London 2012.
Competitors spend years perfecting their bodies, scrupulously eating the right foods, avoiding the wrong ones... and then?
They meet the Olympic dining room.
With a McDonald's at one end and machines dispensing other sponsors soft drinks and confectionery, the giant feeding area provides mountains of forage from all over the world - a complete range of gluttony from one end of the health spectrum to the other.
Cooking for an Olympic Champion: A Recipe for Success
It is a 5,000-hour, 24-hour facility where organizers expect 25,000 breads, 232 tons of potatoes, 75,000 liters of milk and over 330 tons of fruit and vegetables to be consumed by the end of the Games on August 12.
About 1.2 million meals will be served -- 60,000 a day.
For younger athletes it is an exciting new experience, says sports scientist Jess Corones, who works with the Australian Olympic swimming team.
It's all free. There's thousands of athletes and there's almost every kind of kitchen you might want. There's a stand that gives you unlimited McDonald's, there's machines that pump unlimited amounts of soft drinks for you.
That's exciting and can be a distraction for them. They think, oh this is great, and they just run to it -- but you have to remind them that it will still be there when they're done competing and that until they're done competing they have to stay in their normal routine.
What happens as normal can vary enormously.
Phelps, after winning a record eight gold medals in Beijing 2008, told the NBC that he punctured himself with pasta and carb-heavy pizzas at the peak of his extreme training. Blake, Jamaica's 100-meter world champion, says he eats so many bananas to maintain his potassium levels.
British weightlifter Jake Oliver says every morning he drinks a milkshake containing colostrum, a form rich in milk proteins produced during the last stages of cows' pregnancy. I tried to get people to try it, but they didn't. “Only the smell of it is enough to put people out,” The Guardian told the British newspaper.
Or even Japan's former Olympic marathon champion Naoko Takahashi, a tiny runner who told CNN she could eat about 2 kg of fish after a big session.
I only ate twice a day. But I ate a lot, said Takahashi, who won the gold in Sydney 2000 and now works on television.
British Olympian Explains Ideal Meals
However, it is rare for athletes to eat a lot, says Corones, who worked for the first time with Australia’s athletics and field team at the 2004 Athens Games. Phelps really admitted this year that the report of his gigantic appetite was a myth, saying such an intake would be impossible.
“I find it hard to believe,” Corones said. I'll tell you what, if he's eating that he has a very exceptional metabolism! The only people I've seen eat around that are hammer throwers, and they're all weighing 120 kilos.
However, Corones has had some experience of peculiar diets, citing marathon runner Sisay Bezabeh, born in Ethiopia in Australia, from the 2004 team.
We had our camp in Italy and all that used to eat every dinner was a bowl of raw minced meat. I found it pretty gross but I needed iron to run, and that's what he did. You wouldn't get a lot of athletes doing that these days.
Good nutrition from an early age can be vital if you want to be an elite athlete.
Becky Stevenson, a British dietitian based in the Netherlands, has researched the importance of vitamin D to improve performance and prevent injuries.
He cites reports that Chinese adolescents with adequate vitamin D had significantly higher bone mass and muscle strength. Questions have been raised about the incredible performances of teen swimmer Ye Shiwen in London 2012, but this research has not yet shown that high levels of vitamin D could contribute to its success.
We know that low levels can affect muscle strength and bone rotation, but if an athlete has adequate levels there is no evidence of an improved performance benefit, so natural talent and athletic ability is more likely, Stevenson told CNN.
Meanwhile, studies have shown that young athletes in countries in northern Europe such as Britain, Finland and Germany often suffer from vitamin D deficiency. Adequate levels may reduce the risk of stress fractures, inflammatory lesions, and upper respiratory tract infections.
You can get vitamin D from food sources - LRB- such as eggs, dairy and fish -RRB-, but it is not as effective as producing sun, Stevenson said.
Those at risk are athletes who train at 35 degrees or more of latitude -- northern Europe, northern China and North America -- as UVB rays are inadequate during the winter months from November to April.
When we measured our elite tennis players we only found one athlete who was marginal with vitamin D, as he had been injured and was rehabilitating indoors.
There needs to be more research evidence on vitamin D and injury prevention; most of the work is retrospective.
Most athletes use supplements to strengthen their dietary intake, all of daily vitamins such as magnesium and iron plus products such as serum protein, creatine, carnitine and branched-chain amino acids -LRB- BCAAs -RRB- specifically aimed at improving performance and recovery.
However, with the improvement of drug testing standards year after year and the increase of the list of banned substances, there is a strong responsibility for athletes to be very aware of everything they put in their mouth.
Most athletes are using enough supplements. They live an extreme life, the amount of training they do is extreme, they exercise far beyond what the normal person would do, so it is important to supplement their diet, says Corones.
There is a very fine line and it is something that athletes need to stay at the top. The responsibility is 100% on the athlete and we make it very clear to them from an early age that they are responsible for what happens in their mouth. It doesn't matter if it comes from your coach or your parents or your brother or your friend, you need to know what they're putting in your body.
You may trust your 100% coach, but if he gives you a bottle of tablets and tells you it's iron, it's still your responsibility to check. We have hotlines where athletes can call and check anything, so it's pretty easy to figure out if it's okay to take.
At this stage, with the Games in progress and many athletes still waiting to start their competitions, the emphasis is on refining rather than building strength.
It varies depending on where we are in the year, says Corones, who works for the New South Wales Sports Institute in Sydney.
First we want them to carry a little extra weight to reduce the chances of injury and disease, but when it comes down to racing it gets stripped to a minimum, he says.
We don't really make them count calories, we look more at what areas of food groups are eating. You are looking to get quality fats, making sure you get enough carbohydrates, and also the time of food - whether you are swimming or doing gymnasium.
If you're doing gymnastics there's a major mechanical breakdown of the muscle so we need to eat more protein after the session, with a little bit before the session.
A large part of Coronesjob is to make sure athletes learn the right eating habits -- and this usually means breaking the eating patterns formed at an early age.
It's a pretty big educational process for athletes. There are still some who struggle with that concept that the less processed it is, the better it is for them, he says.
Often, at the beginning of their careers, in their young teens, they do a lot of training and want to take the first thing that is available faster because they are always hungry after training. So they have the habit of having a bucket of hot potatoes after each training session. Obviously that's not great, so we're trying to break those habits.
We often find that processed foods -- with high salt and high sugar content in them -- that the body may want them. It's about trying to break those cycles and make them eat as best they can.

"Forrest Gump is a 1994 film depicting the life of a simple man born in Alabama who achieves great success in life despite being mentally slow. The main character is played by the great Tom Hanks, who is involved in many of the most significant moments in American history. The film and character have become iconic figures of American society because of their message that any feat can be accomplished regardless of the obstacles they face.

Gump was born to a single mother in rural Alabama during the 1950s. He is a slow minded boy who seems to have no knowledge of his surroundings, or purpose in life. A school counselor tells his mother that Gump's IQ is so low, and would be placed in a special vocational program. His mother convinces the counselor not to consider Gump's low index. Forrest is allowed to attend an ordinary public school.
Due to his athletic skill, Gump gets a scholarship to play football at the University of Alabama, where he excels in the game. When he graduated, he was approached by an army recruiter, and joined the military, where he excelled again. Gump is awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for saving the lives of many of his comrades during a fierce shooting in the Vietnam War.
After his time in the service, Gump wins an international ping pong competition in China, knocks down President Richard Nixon while staying at the infamous Watergate Hotel, meets three presidents, and goes on several cross-country races that gain mass media attention. Throughout his life, Gump has a strong relationship with his army friends, and loves his only childhood friend and affection, Jenny. Forrest Gump plays the American spirit like no other movie.",C1
"The vision of colleagues and acquaintances crawling into an electronic cigarette has become commonplace. But have we reached “peak vape”? Statistics suggest that vaping among recent smokers and former smokers, who make up the vast majority of vapers, may already be in decline. The figures will be studied closely by major e-cigarette companies, which have invested millions in promoting a technology that was thought to have grown in popularity.
The figures published in 2014 by the charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) reveal that the consumption of e-cigarettes among adults in Britain – which do not contain tobacco and produce steam, not smoke – tripled from about 700,000 users in 2012 to 2.1 million in 2014.
However, the figures collected by the Smoking Toolkit Study, a research agency supported by the Department of Health that provides quarterly updates on smoking trends, show that vaping’s attractiveness may be decreasing. Vaping rates among smokers and former smokers increased steadily until the end of 2013, when about 22% of smokers and former smokers were vaping. But this proportion stabilized throughout 2014 before falling to 19% during the last quarter of 2014. Early indications suggest that the decline has continued in 2015. The fall is described as “statistically significant” by Professor Robert West of the UCL Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, who compiles the figures for the Instrumental.
Smokers are the key group for e-cigarette companies because seven out of ten vapers are smokers. Only about 1% of people who have never smoked have tried an electronic cigarette. “The numbers that use e-cigarettes while they continue smoking are dropping,” West said. “We’ve only been tracking vaping for just over a year, so it’s a short period of time, but we’re not seeing the growth in the number of former long-term smokers or ‘never’ smokers using e-cigarettes. That does not mean that vaping rates do not change, but, at this stage, they seem to remain the same.”
The stabilization of vaping popularity in the UK seems to disagree with what is happening in the US, where technology has been aggressively promoted and where recent reports suggest it is growing in popularity. However, West questioned the interpretation of American data, which made little distinction between people who had once tried an electronic cigarette and those who regularly vaped.
According to experts, fears that vaping may become fashionable among young non-smokers seem to be out of place. Only 1.8 per cent of children are regular users, according to the ASH study. On the other hand, e-cigarettes seem to be more popular among adults trying to quit. “Although figures released this month by Smoking In England show that the use of e-cigarette by smokers has stabilized, their data also show the huge increase in use since May 2011,” said James Dunworth, director and co-founder of ecigarettedirect.co.uk. “Our customers are still very happy with the product, and hardware technology and innovation is improving users’ experience and helping them change traditional cigarettes.”
“Electronic cigarettes behave like a nicotine patch in soup,” West agreed. “They are more popular than nicotine patches and may or may not be more effective. One third of attempts to quit use e-cigarettes, making them the most popular method of stopping.”
Hazel Cheeseman, ASH's policy director, said it was too early to say whether vaping had reached its peak. “Although there are indications that the market has not grown in the UK for about a year, there does not seem to be a decrease in the number of people using e-cigarettes to help them quit smoking. Using an electronic cigarette is safer than smoking; some people, but not all, find it useful to help quit smoking and there is little evidence that it will lead to an increase in the number of young people who smoke.”
It recently emerged that the European Commission (EC) is studying the increase in taxes on e-cigarettes, which could have an impact on their popularity. A new EU tobacco directive will enter into force in 2016 to limit the amount of nicotine in e-cigarettes to below current levels. This may mean vapers will need to increase your use to get the same hit, again something that can make e-cigarettes more expensive.
West suggested that policymakers view e-cigarettes as an aid to quit smoking and not subject them to the same rules as tobacco. “There is a tendency among some local authorities and organizations to treat e-cigarettes as cigarettes and ban them in public places and outdoors,” he said.

"Crispy, full of protein and found under a rock near you. Insects have long been overlooked as food in all parts of the world, except in a handful, but are now crawling closer and closer to our dishes. Spring 2013 will see an impulse towards eliminating the yuck factor and putting insects not only on the experimental gastronomic menus, but also on the shelves of the supermarket.
In April, there will be a festival in London, Pestival 2013 – an insect appreciation event supported by Wellcome Trust where the consumption of creepy bugs is high on the agenda. It features a two - day pop - up restaurant by Nordic Food Lab, the Scandinavian team behind the Danish Noma restaurant, which brought ants to the table for a ten - day delivery at the Claridge hotel in Mayfair in 2012.
Noma has been named the best restaurant in the world by Restaurant magazine for three consecutive years. His chef, René Redzepi, says ants taste like lemon, and a puree of fermented grasshoppers and moth larvae tastes like strong fish sauce. Bee larvae make a sweet mayonnaise used instead of eggs and scientists are constantly developing new ways to use small creatures.
In March, a BBC documentary will present food writer Stefan Gates looking for and eating fried lobsters and roasted tarantulas. But behind all the tricks and jokes about flies in the soup is a very serious message. Many experts believe that there is a clear environmental benefit for humans who eat chilling.
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has been funding projects since 2011 to promote insect feeding and breeding in South-East Asia and Africa, where it is estimated that two billion people already eat insects and caterpillar larvae as a regular part of their diet. In 2012, FAO published a list of 1,909 edible species of insects and, under the patronage of the Dutch government, plans a major international conference on “this valuable food source” in 2013.
Insects are abundant – globally, for every human being there are 40 tons of insects – so there is not too much chance that they are in danger, and they are unlikely to have been dosed with chemicals. “I know it’s taboo to eat bugs in the Western world, but why not?” said Redzepi. “You’re going to Southeast Asia and this is common. You read from everyone that people are eating bugs. If you like mushrooms, you've eaten so many worms you can't imagine. But we also eat honey, and honey is the vomit of a bee. Think about it the next time you pour it in your tea.
He said the basic premise behind Nordic Food Lab was: “Nothing is edible.” Insects are critical to life on Earth and, with more than a million species, are the most diverse group of creatures on the planet, yet they are misunderstood, hated and often killed by humans just because they are there.
In the next 30 years, the human population of the planet will increase to nine billion people. Already a billion people don't get enough food. The increase will put more pressure on agricultural land, water, forests, fisheries and biodiversity resources, as well as on nutrients and energy supply.
The cost of meat is increasing, not only in terms of cash, but also in terms of the amount of rainforest that is being destroyed for grazing or for the cultivation of livestock food. There is also the problem of methane excreted by cows. The livestock contribution, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, is enormous: 35% of the planet's methane, 65% of its nitrous oxide and 9% of carbon dioxide.
Edible insects emit fewer gases, contain high-quality proteins, vitamins and amino acids, and have a high rate of food conversion, requiring a quarter of the intake of sheep food, and half of pigs and chickens, to produce the same amount of protein. They emit less greenhouse gases and less ammonia than cows and can be grown with organic waste. China is already successfully creating huge worm farms. Zimbabwe has a thriving Mapan caterpillar industry and Laos received almost $500,000 from FAO to develop an insect harvesting project. It is already a big deal in the UK, though not always official: a man was recently arrested by Gatwick Customs when he got off a flight from Burkina Faso with 94 kilos of mapone, worth almost 40,000 pounds, in his luggage.
A study by FoodServiceWarehouse.com suggested that the exchange of pork and meat for crickets and lobsters could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 95%. But perhaps the fairest thing about eating worms and insects comes when we are dead – then they have the chance to nibble their own back.

"Apple's brand and logo have been named the world's most valuable – worth nearly $119 billion, or more than all of Morocco, Ecuador, or Oman's gross domestic product.
Silicon Valley, already the world’s largest company – with a $591 billion stock market valuation – has seen its brand value increase by 21% in 12 months, according to Interbrand Best Global Brands’ annual report.
Apple, which is recognized worldwide for its simple emblem of “Apple with a bited miss”, led a wave of technology companies in the 2014 report, which has pushed more traditionally valuable brands – such as Coca-Cola, McDonald’s and Gillette – through the table.
The value of the Google brand increased by 15% to $107 billion to take second place, followed by Coca-Cola, up to 3% to $81.5 billion, IBM ($72.2 trillion) and Microsoft ($45.5 trillion).
Facebook is the biggest increase in the chart, increasing its brand value by 86% to $14.3 billion and taking 29th place on the chart, ahead of long-standing global corporate names such as Volkswagen, Kellogg’s and Ford.
Jez Frampton, executive director of Interbrand, which is part of Omnicom’s global advertising group, said: “Beneficiating immensely from the rise of digital technology and later mobile, smart brands like Apple became stronger. New category killers like Google, Amazon and Facebook have re-established customer expectations and significantly raised the bar for brand experiences.”
Apple, which former CEO Steve Jobs founded in his Los Altos garage in 1976, appeared among the top ten in Interbrand's annual studio in 2011.
Its logo, created by advertising executive Rob Janoff in 1977, was designed with a bite taken from it to avoid confusion with a cherry. “One of the deep mysteries for me is our logo, the symbol of lust and knowledge, bitten, all crossed with the colors of the rainbow in the wrong order. You couldn’t dream of a more appropriate logo: lust, knowledge, hope and anarchy,” Janoff said.
Graham Hayles, marketing director at Interbrand, said that ""it wasn't out of kilter"" that Apple's brand could account for one fifth of the company's entire market value. “Apple makes a lot of money because it has a very strong brand,” he said. “There is a very strong correlation between branding and profitability.”
Hayles said Interbrand, which has been conducting the annual study since 2000, calculates the value of the brand by examining the financial performance of companies, the “brand leadership” of consumers and the “brand strength analysis”.
While many technology companies climbed the list, there were big falls, too. The Finnish mobile phone company Nokia dropped 41 places to 98th to $4.1 billion, just ahead of Nintendo in 100th position (down 33). “Now it’s just the two of them on the chart,” Hayles said. “It shows the importance of getting the right innovation. If you don’t keep up, it’s very penalizing.”
For the first time, a Chinese company has reached the top 100, with Huawei’s mobile phone and broadband firm entering the ranking at 94th place with a brand value of $4.3 billion. Huawei has been partially banned by U.S. governments. and Australia due to fear that their team could be used by the Chinese for cyber-espionage.
Most of the top 100 brands are US-owned, the top non-US brands are Samsung (6a) from South Korea, Toyota (8a) from Japan and Mercedes-Benz (10a) from Germany. The highest British brands are HSBC (33rd), Shell (65th) and Burberry (73rd).
Other top 100 fashion brands include Boss, Prada and Ralph Lauren. The Louis Vuitton design label is the best name in fashion, in position 19, with a value of $23 billion, just ahead of the H&M high street clothing chain, with a brand value of $21 billion and ranked 21.
The Nike sports brand, which ranks 22 with a brand valued at almost $20 billion, is well ahead of rival Adidas, with 59 in the top 100 worth $7 billion.
Frampton said that consumers' ability to interact and criticize brands on Twitter and other social media means that companies must react faster to retain and improve their brands' reputation.
“The client, empowered by social media in the ‘age of experience’, now has more control than ever,” he said. “In this world of bidirectional conversations, defense, influence and commitment are the new rules for brand creation.
“Customers expect seamless interactions, responsiveness, 24/7 accessibility, customization options, and high levels of customization,” he said. “In a sense, they are increasingly waiting for brands to know them.”

"In 1982, composer San Bao fell in love with musical theatre -- then an alien art form in China -- when he saw a video-recorded version of CATS, which became the longest musical in Broadway history.
Fast forward three decades, and San Bao, who has enjoyed a successful career writing pop songs and leading music production at the Beijing Olympics, wants to do national musicals to rival some of Andrew Lloyd Webber's greatest hits.
This is what I want... a real musical with Chinese characteristics, he told CNN.
San Bao has performed seven musicals since 2005 and his last Nie Xiaoqian and Ning Caichen, currently touring in China, are inspired by a collection of supernatural tales written during the Qing dynasty.
Undersigned by government funds, none of its musicals has yet earned any benefits, much less broken box office records, although a 2005 production called Butterflies reached South Korean stages on a 2008 tour.
It takes time for people to appreciate this art form, San Bao said.
Ten years ago, no one in China would spend money buying a movie ticket, but now? People don't talk about what movies they saw, they talk about which movies they missed.

Rave tests
Some Broadway shows have captivated the Chinese public. The epic French revolution Les Miserables was a success when it debuted in Shanghai in 2002.
More recently, a Chinese version of Mamma Mia! that toured in August 2011 gross 20 million yuan -LRB- $3.2 million -RRB- in less than a month and according to China Daily, a 2013 production of The Phantom of the Opera was sold five months before its release.
But high ticket prices mean that these programs reach a limited audience, and it's usually only Broadway's most accessible hits that resonate with a Chinese audience, says Zhou Yinchen, the head of the Folk Music and Music Research Center at Beijing University's Academy of Arts.
Mamma Mia is entertaining, so the Chinese accept it, she says. Of course there are other Broadway musicals, but they are only those with the most valuable entertainment work in China, he adds.
However, public criticism has given these shows that music producers like San Bao are confident that combining the Broadway show with Chinese plot lines will one day result in a sure success.
Cartoon character
In addition to China's imperial past, San Bao has also performed shows on a Chinese cartoon character similar to Tintin, and the long march of the Chinese Communist Party, a 6,000-mile journey that helped consolidate Mao Zedong's stature as a great leader.
San Bao says one of the biggest challenges it faces is the shortage of interpreters of all kinds.
Few Chinese actors and actresses have equally strong singing and dancing skills that musical theatre requires, he said.
And although China offers some undergraduate courses in musical theatre, these departments are relatively new and the level of experience is not deep.
Xu Luyang, a classical music critic, also says that music productions often cannot afford the high salary needed to attract the best talents.
The music industry is China is still immature, he said.

"Nelson Mandela, the imposing figure of Africa's struggle for freedom and hero to millions of people around the world, has died at the age of 95.
The first Black president of South Africa died in the company of his family in Johannesburg after years of deteriorating health, which had led him to withdraw from public life.
The news was announced to the country by the current president, Jacob Zuma, who, in a grim televised speech, said Mandela had “deserted” around 8.50 pm local time and was at peace.
“This is the moment of our deepest pain,” Zuma said. Our nation has lost its greatest son. What made Nelson Mandela great was precisely what made him human. We saw in him what we seek in ourselves.
“South African Followers, Nelson Mandela brought us together and it is together that we will fire him.”
Zuma announced that Mandela would receive a state funeral and ordered the flags to fly half a pole.
Archbishop Desmond Tutu led a memorial service in Cape Town, where he called for South Africa to become a nation what Mandela had been like a man.
Barack Obama paid tribute to world leaders, referring to Mandela as a clan – Madiba. The U.S. president said: “Through his fierce dignity and unwavering will to sacrifice his own freedom for the freedom of others, Madiba transformed South Africa – and moved us all.
“His journey from prisoner to president embodied the promise that human beings – and countries – can change for the better. His commitment to transfer power and reconcile with those who imprisoned him is an example to which all humanity must aspire, whether in the life of nations or in our own personal life.”
UK Prime Minister David Cameron said, “A great light has come out into the world,” and described Mandela as “a hero of our time.”
FW de Klerk – the South African president who freed Mandela, shared with him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 and paved the way for him to become South Africa’s first post-apartheid head of state – said the news was deeply sad for South Africa and the world.
“He lived reconciliation. He was a great uniter,” he said of Klerk.
People gathered in the streets of South Africa to celebrate Mandela's life.
In Soweto, people gathered to sing and dance near the house where they once lived. They formed a circle in the middle of Vilakazi Street and sang songs of the anti-apartheid struggle. Some people were covered with South African flags and the colors green, yellow and black of the Mandela party, the African National Congress (ANC). Mandela's death leads South Africa to deep mourning and self-reflection, almost 20 years after having led the country of racial apartheid to inclusive democracy.
But his death will also be greatly felt by people from all over the world, who venerated Mandela as one of the last great statesmen in history, and a moral paradigm comparable to Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and Martin Luther King. It was his act of forgiveness, after 27 years in prison, 18 of them on Robben Island, that will ensure his place in history. With South Africa facing a possible civil war, Mandela sought reconciliation with the white minority to build a new democracy.
He led the ANC to victory in the country's first multiracial elections in 1994. He then voluntarily resigned after a term of office.
Born Rolihlahla Dalibhunga in a small town in Eastern Cape on July 18, 1918, Mandela received his name in English, Nelson, by a teacher at his school.
He joined the ANC in 1943 and became a co-founder of his youth league. In 1952, he founded South Africa's first black law firm with his partner, Oliver Tambo.
Mandela was a charming and charismatic figure with a passion for boxing and an eye for women. He once said: “I can’t help it if the ladies take note of me. I’m not going to protest.”
When the ANC was banned in 1960, Mandela went underground. After the Sharpeville massacre, in which 69 Black protesters were shot to death by the police, he made the difficult decision to launch an armed struggle. He was arrested and finally charged with sabotage and attempted to overthrow the government.
Leading his own defense at Rivonia’s trial in 1964, he said: “I have appreciated the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all people live together in harmony and with equal opportunities.
“It is an ideal that I hope to live and achieve. But, if necessary, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.”
He escaped the death penalty but was sentenced to life imprisonment, a big blow for the ANC, which had to regroup to continue the struggle. But the riots grew in the municipalities and international pressure on the apartheid regime slowly hardened.
Finally, in 1990, FW of Klerk lifted the ban on the ANC and Mandela was released from prison amid scenes of joy witnessed all over the world.
His presidency mounted a wave of tremendous global goodwill, but it was not without difficulties. After abandoning the frontline policy in 1999, he admitted that he should have moved earlier against the spread of HIV and AIDS in South Africa.
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who led the truth and reconciliation committee after the fall of apartheid, said: “He transcended race and class in his personal actions, through his warmth and willingness to listen and empathize with others. And he restored the faith of others in Africa and in Africans.”
Mandela continued to make occasional appearances at the ANC events and attended the inauguration of the current president, Jacob Zuma. His 91st birthday was marked by the first annual “Day of Mandela” in his honor.
He married three times, had six children, 17 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.

"1 Flappy Bird
Be careful what you want, especially if you want to invent something new. Recently, Dong Nguyen, the mobile game designer Flappy Bird, pulled him out of app stores, saying that his success – had been downloaded more than 50 million times, and was making him about £30,000 in advertising revenue every day – had ruined his simple life. He went to his Twitter account to say, “I can’t do this anymore.”
OK, so regretting to do Flappy Bird isn't exactly the same as regretting to make a rifle, but Nguyen is just the last in a long line of inventors who wish they hadn't created a monster.
2 The Labradoodle
The labradoodle is not a monster – it is adorable, obviously. But the monstrous thing is the way the cross dogs have been raised and marketed since the inventor of the labradoodle, Wally Conron, first created the breed in the 1980s. “I’ve done a lot of damage,” he told Associated Press. “I have created many problems. There are a lot of unhealthy and abandoned dogs out there.” Conron came with the labradoodle when he was working for the Royal Guide Dog Association of Australia to provide a dog for a blind woman whose husband was allergic to dog hair. What I didn't expect was that the labradoodle – and its other variants of poodle-cross, many of which have health problems – would become so popular.
3 AK-47
Six months before his death in December 2013, Mikhail Kalashnikov, the assault rifle designer, wrote to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church: “My spiritual torment is unbearable. One and the same question: if my father killed people, does that mean that I, Mikhail Kalashnikov, 93, son of a peasant, Christian and Orthodox by faith, am responsible for the death of people, even if they were enemies?”
4 Electronic marking
The electronic label was originally conceived in the 1960s as a way to track former prisoners' attendance at schools and workplaces, and reward them for their good behavior. His inventors, Bob Gable and his brother Kirkland, were later horrified that the label had become a form of control and punishment. “It’s not nice,” Kirkland Gable told the Guardian in 2010, “but I don’t have control of the universe. I have to realize that there are some things out of my control.
5 pepper spray
After the police sprayed peaceful protesters with pepper spray on a campus at the University of California in 2011, one of the scientists who helped develop it in the 1980s denounced its use. “I’ve never seen such inappropriate and improper use of chemical agents,” Kamran Loghman told the New York Times.
6 The office cubicle
In the late 1960s, a new form of office was launched, designed to give workers privacy and increase productivity by providing more work space. Instead, it became a way for companies to stack employees in narrower spaces, a visual shorthand for uniformity and soulless work. His inventor, Bob Propst, said in 1997, “the cubicle of people in modern corporations is monolithic madness.”

"Paula Broadwell, a woman who was romantically involved with former CIA director David Petraeus, will not face federal charges of cyberbullying another woman friend of Petraeus.
The Tampa Prosecutor's Office informed Broadwell's lawyer Robert Muse of the decision in a brief letter dated 14 December.
As an objective of our investigation, we believe it is appropriate to inform your client that our office has determined that no federal charges on cyberbullying charges will be filed, wrote U.S. Attorney's Assistant W. Stephen Muldrow.
Muse told CNN that he was very pleased that the U.S. Attorney's office in Tampa resolved this matter very quickly.
A source near Broadwell said the letter had been received on Monday.
He is satisfied with the prosecutor's decision and happy that it has been resolved, the source told CNN.
Petraeus resigned on 9 November after revealing that he had been involved in an extramarital affair.
U.S. officials said the FBI found that Petraeus was involved with Broadwell, a woman under investigation for sending allegedly harassed and anonymous emails to Jill Kelley, a socialite from Tampa who was a friend of Petraeus and his wife.
Sources close to Kelley said she had not been romantically involved with Petraeus.
During the investigation, the FBI obtained Broadwell's computer and discovered that it had classified materials. Researchers also searched Broadwell's house in North Carolina. Sources said the materials were technically classified but not very sensitive. Still, FBI and DOJ prosecutors have not resolved whether Broadwell will face charges for having such materials in his personal possession.
Sources close to Broadwell acknowledged that the issue has not been resolved.
Broadwell, 40, wrote a biography of Petraeus, a retired general who led U.S. forces in Iraq and later in Afghanistan. A former Army reservist, Broadwell's security clearance was suspended after details of her possession of classified materials appeared.
During the investigation it was also revealed that Kelley and Army General John Allen were exchanging emails, some of which might have been considered inappropriate. That matter was handed over to the Pentagon Inspector General for investigation.

"DES MOINES, Iowa -LRB- CNN -RRB- The 2016 Republican presidential race in Iowa had its unofficial start on Saturday with a marathon of speeches, giving about a dozen potential candidates the opportunity to introduce -LRB- or reintroduce -RRB- themselves to a central group of caucus-goers about a year before the competition.
Immigration and Islamic extremism took the front and center as the White House hopefuls sought to test their stump speeches. In the same way, it was the Wisconsin government. Scott Walker and Texas Senator Ted Cruz saw strong receptions from the audience, although support for a large number of candidates was expressed in the corridors after the event.
Government of New Jersey. Chris Christie also sought to establish a deeper link with Iowa. The Hawkeye State receives excessive attention in the presidential years thanks to its first-ever status in the nation during the primary season.
Time for the marathon
During the day of 10 hours of consecutive speeches, the candidates, as they were called, joined other high-profile Republicans at Hoyt Sherman Place, an ancient and intricate theater built in 1877 that also became the first public art museum in Des Moines.
Conceived as the Iowa Freedom Summit, the event was co-hosted by United Citizens and representative Steve King, a revered legislator representing the northwestern part of the state and has considerable influence among the party's most conservative social and right-wing Christian faction.
It was no secret that it was considered a cattle call for the presidential race. Former governor of Arkansas. Mike Huckabee, for example, said the reason he ended his Fox News program was for a bigger target he has in mind.
It wasn't just to go hunting deer every weekend, I can assure you, he said.
Others were more brazen.
I'm a potential presidential candidate, yes, former CEO of Hewlett Packard Carly Fiorina told CNN.
Even Palin longed to enter part of the action, joking before his appearance on Saturday that he was now seriously considering a career. And real estate titan Donald Trump told reporters on Saturday that he will make his decision before June.
I'm the only person who can make this country big again, that's all I know, he told the reporters on Saturday. No one else can.
Palin, in his remarks, was less progressive. Passing through a rather dizzying and difficult to follow speech, Palin suggested that the country is ready for a leading woman, but not Hillary Clinton.
Hey Iowa, can anyone stop Hillary? She said, inciting the public to cheer. For borrowing a sentence, we can!
The class of 2016
Speakers, who were normally given 20 minutes, used most of their speeches to share their own personal teachings. Ben Carson and Christie talked about their strict but sharp mothers, while Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas talked about having pastors as parents.
Other better-known names in Iowa, such as former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum who won the state caucus in 2012 and Huckabee, who won in 2008, tried to remind the Iowans why they chose them first, diving into their personalities, but also focusing on issues.
Given King's credentials as a frank opponent of illegal immigration, it was no surprise that problems at the border became a focal point in many of Saturday's speeches.
Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, argued that there would be no people coming in here without a magnet to attract them, suggesting that there should be a criminal punishment for employers hiring undocumented workers.
However, the main objective in the immigration battle was President Barack Obama's executive action to delay the deportation of up to five million undocumented immigrants. Or, as Palin said, in his popular fanfare, Obama's decision makes him look like an overgrown child who is acting a little spoiled.
Speakers opposed the President's promise to use his pen and phone to work around Congress, with immigration as an example of what many called the president's exaggeration.
That was scored when DREAM Act Coalition protesters interrupted Rick Perry's speech, leading to an arrest and a theater full of Iowa citizens trying to drown the protesters.
Potential candidates also warned about what they see as a difficult road for the country, particularly when it comes to foreign policy, an issue that, along with immigration, also seems to be about to become a turning point in the 2016 presidential race, unlike 2012.
Santorum argued that the growth of ISIS is a consequence of the isolationism and weakness of the Obama administration. Cruz, like several speakers, said the President will fail in the war on terrorism if he refuses to use the words radical Islamic terrorism.
Huckabee criticized Obama for spending more time on climate change in the State of the Union speech than talking about terrorism.
A decapitation is a much greater threat to Americans than a sunburn, Huckabee said.
Issues
There was a lot of Iowa's usual charm on stage, speeches with pig analogies and corn references. And there was more than one reference to how people in Iowa are somehow higher than average.
On a large screen on the stage you could see an image of a red barn sitting on a green hill surrounded by white fences. Steve King's name, on all the casings, was wrapped in banners on stage, as well as on the podium.
The contenders also distributed a large amount of red meat, blowing up Obamacare, Common Core, the media, Hillary Clinton and the $18 trillion debt. Cruz won big applause for proposing to place 110,000 IRS employees on the southern border, joking that they will do a better job to deter illegal immigration than anything else.
Screaming at the newly elected U.S. Senator Joni Ernst was also a popular topic on the agenda for potential candidates. Almost everyone referred to her as their friend, and almost as much affection and time was dedicated to the other beloved senator of the state, Chuck Grassley.
Walker, who, like Cruz, stepped on stage as he spoke, gave an impressive speech that perfected his history as governor. He spoke about the implementation of voter identification laws, and painted himself as the brave warrior who confronted public employees and won during the 2011 collective bargaining rights debate.
He also did not forget to mention that he has been elected three times in the last four years.
Shortly after his speech, two men, both from Council Bluffs, spoke outside about how they were impressed by Walker's comments.
If he could do on a national scale what he did in Wisconsin, this country would be, a man, Michael Patomson, began to say, before his friend, Bill Hartzell, intercepted: Transformed. The country would be transformed.
The reception
Many attendees had difficulty choosing only one favorite in the line of potential contenders. Several mentioned Fiorina as a surprise blow.
“There was only one pantheon of people to listen to,” Eric Rosenthal of Cedar Rapids said.
Rick Perry was better than the last time I heard him... that's good. He needs it, said Ernie Rudolph, from Dallas County, Iowa.
Christie also saw a warm reception and challenged the idea that a Republican governor of a blue state who has a Jersey-type reputation will not connect with voters in Iowa.
That somehow I am too strong, too direct and too direct, Christie said, rejecting criticism as the conventional wisdom of Washington experts. They're wrong.
However, it was remarkably different from its usual style. His behavior was toned and he read from his comments prepared on the podium, a stark contrast with his preferred method out of control.
Some of the talks in the hallways and reporters also had two potential contenders who were not there: Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney.
Trump said it simply: Mitt had his chance. He should have won and drowned. As for Bush: We've had enough of the Bushes.
Sens. Rand Paul and Marco Rubio, as well as the governor. Bobby Jindal also skipped the event, but since it's a year before the Iowans start caucus, losing an event is unlikely to hurt them.
Saturday's event was more of a backdrop, taking the first look at what is likely to be a competitive Republican primary.
Walker, closing his speech, offered a promise that will probably be reflected by several of the speakers on stage over the next year: I will come back many times more.

"The United States is one of the most diversified countries in the world. It is made up of many different cultures from Latin America, Europe, Asia and Africa. It is truly a melting pot of diversity. All these cultures have come together to create a new culture - an American culture. Many of the traditions, customs, religions and celebrations of these cultures have been adopted in American culture, including the funeral traditions.

Traditional American funerals are basic. They usually include some kind of religious ritual, followed by a procession to cemeteries, and a small ceremony at the tomb site, but these vary depending on the culture. At most American funerals, the deceased's family sends a death announcement called an obituary. These obituaries usually serve to transmit information to others about the deceased, and the time and day of the funeral event. In church service, the deceased is often praised by friends and family. This is where a person goes up to the front of the crowd to say some things about the deceased, and how he or she affected his life. The procession usually takes the form of a caravan of private cars, and trucks that follow the hearse, which contains the coffin of the deceased, and remains.
In the tomb, another small ritual takes place where the deceased receives a blessing from a member of the clergy. Friends and family are allowed to say goodbye to the deceased. There is an American tradition of picking up a handful of land, and throwing it in the coffin as a way of saying goodbye to the deceased. The family then meets in a house, or restaurant with some of the attendees to eat, and exchange stories before moving on. Most cultures in the United States have adopted this traditional American funeral ritual, but many include features that are unique to their individual culture.",C1
"Because of the wide range of crimes that can be punished by imprisonment, some people argue that not all offenders are equal and that it would therefore be more appropriate to provide community services to certain offenders instead. I agree that in some cases prison may not be the best solution and community service would probably have more benefits.
One justification for prisons is to keep society safe by taking criminals out of the outside world. So the first thing to consider is whether someone who has violated the law is a danger to other people. In the case of violent crimes, there is an argument to keep the perpetrator away from society. However, the theft or possession of drugs, for example, does not involve violence against others, so the criminal does not pose a direct danger to anyone in the community. Keeping such criminals in prison is expensive for the taxpayer and does not seem to be an effective punishment, as they often commit the same crime again when they leave prison.
Personally, I also believe that punishments must reform people so that they do not commit crime again. One more reason not to imprison these people is that they can mix with more dangerous and violent criminals, potentially committing a worse crime when they are released. By keeping them in the community, helping others, they not only learn new skills, but can also develop more empathy and care for others. If this happens, society can only benefit.
Critics of this more rehabilitative approach to crime believe that justice should be harsh to deter people from committing similar crimes and that community service might be less likely to have that effect. However, there is very little evidence to suggest that long prison sentences deter offenders.
In conclusion, putting criminals who are not a danger to society in prison is expensive and, in my opinion, ineffective, both as a deterrent and as a form of rehabilitation. Community service for non-violent crimes benefits both society and the offender. Having said that, it would be useful to have more data to determine whether community service or prison is more likely to detain a repeat offender. I firmly believe that decisions on how best to treat criminals should be based on evidence of what really works.",C1
"Peruvian President Ollanta Humala has removed 30 of the 55 generals of the national police, the biggest purge in the history of the institution.
The forced retirements, announced in the official gazette over the weekend, are widely seen as an attempt by Humala to combat corruption.
Among those expelled was the head of the national police.
The new chief of police, Raúl Salazar, mentioned the need to fight corruption no less than six times during a speech at his induction ceremony.
We have to discover any act of corruption that stains the name of the police. From the least to the most important, it doesn't matter, whether one sun or more are stolen, he said, referring to Peru's currency.
In a separate interview on the state radio station on Tuesday, Salazar said the fight against drug trafficking would remain a priority.
The movement means that until new generals are named, many regions of Peru, including many within the country, will be led by colonels rather than generals, something that opposition politicians have criticized.
Critics also expressed concern that the movement was a stratagem of Humala, as the new president, to place commanders loyal to him in senior positions.
His Minister of the Interior, Oscar Valdés, said Tuesday that the retirements had to do with a reorganization of a swollen institution, reported the Andean news agency, led by the state.
This is a measure studied, it's a police restructuring, he said. It's not possible that the police have so many generals.
Before the purge, the police had 55 generals, 900 colonels and more than 2,000 commanders, he said.

"Sweden is the best country for the elderly, Afghanistan the worst, but overall wealth does not necessarily mean better conditions for those over the age of 60, according to the world's first ageing index. Although Sweden’s highest ranking – followed by Norway, Germany, the Netherlands and Canada – can be predictable, the Global AgeWatch index gives some surprising results.
The United States, the richest country in the world, has fallen to eighth, while the United Kingdom does not reach number 13. Sri Lanka ranks 36th, well above Pakistan, with 89, despite similar levels of gross domestic product (GDP). Bolivia and Mauritius score above the size of their economies, while the emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China are a mixed stock exchange. Brazil and China occupy a relatively high place in the index; India and Russia are much lower.
“This survey shows that the story tells,” said Mark Gorman, director of the defense group at HelpAge International. “Best ranked countries are what would be expected, but Scandinavian countries were not rich when they introduced universal pensions. Sri Lanka ' s older population was now benefiting from good basic education and health care: those countries had made certain political decisions. Everyone faces scarce resources, but they must not forget that when making investment decisions, they must also address the problems of old age.”
The index, developed with the United Nations Population and Development Fund, covers 91 countries and 89 per cent of the world ' s elderly. The survey comes in the midst of a major demographic change: by 2050, two billion people over the age of 60 are expected to comprise more than one fifth of the world's population.
Population ageing – when older people account for an increasing proportion of the population – is occurring more rapidly in developing countries.
More than two thirds of older persons live in poor countries; by 2050, this proportion is expected to be approximately four fifths. While the oldest population in France took 115 years to double from 7% to 14% between 1865 and 1980, Brazil is likely to make the same change between 2011 and 2032, in only 21 years.
The index shows that the fastest-growing countries (Jordan, Laos, Mongolia, Nicaragua and Vietnam, where the number of older people is expected to more than triple by 2050) fall into the lower half of the ranking, suggesting that policymakers need to address ageing head-on if they are to adequately support their populations.
There are gender differences between ageing populations, and women generally survive men. In 2012, for every 84 men aged 60 and over, there were 100 women. Lack of paid work (hence savings), reduced decision-making power in the family and vulnerability to violence contribute to the disadvantage that many women face in old age.
However, if appropriate measures are implemented, the ageing of the population does not inevitably lead to a significant increase in spending on health care, according to the report, which highlights the importance of long-term investments in education and health care for older persons. Bolivia, which ranks 46, despite being one of the poorest countries, has introduced progressive policies for older persons, with a national plan on ageing, free medical care and a universal non-contributory pension. Nepal, ranked 77, introduced a basic pension in 1995 for persons over 70 years of age without other pension income. Although its value and eligibility are limited and its coverage is uneven, it is an example of how a poor country has chosen to begin addressing poverty in old age.
Good basic health care introduced decades ago in Chile and Costa Rica has served the ageing population of those countries. A good education system – basic literacy is crucial for older people, as they deal with pension bureaucracy – is of great benefit in the future. In the Philippines, older persons have benefited from post-independence education reforms in 1946, which made primary and secondary education compulsory. The same applies to Armenia, which, like other countries of the former Soviet Union, benefited from a strong education system. South Korea, a surprisingly low 67 in the ageing index, had worse results than similar countries on the basis of GDP per head, partly because it introduced a pension recently.
The ageing index is calculated using 13 indicators under four headings: income security, health care, employment and education, and an enabling environment. All indicators have the same weight, with the exception of pension income coverage, life expectancy at age 60, healthy life expectancy at age 60 and psychological well-being. These categories were given greater weight because of improved data quality and only countries were included if sufficient data were available.
Professor Sir Richard Jolly, creator of the human development index, said: “This innovative index expands the way we understand the needs and opportunities of older persons through its pioneering application of human development methodology. It challenges countries in all parts of the world to raise their eyes as to what is possible.”

"The Marlboro Man was a fictional character who appeared in several advertising campaigns for the Philip Morris Corporation. His announcements were broadcast on television from 1964 to 1999, effectively entering the collective consciousness of the American people for generations. Philip Morris is one of the largest tobacco companies in the world, and the corporation used Marlboro Man with great success over the years.

Marlboro's man was a strong and robust man riding a mighty horse, and he traveled all over the country promoting tobacco products. It appeared on television, radio, the press and advertisements for decades. When the U.S. General Surgeon considered tobacco smoke unhealthy in the 1960s, the beginning of the end for Marlboro Man had begun. The Surgeon General launched an anti-smoking campaign demanding that all cigarette companies place their warning label on every package sold in the country. The warning included the phrase that ""smoking can cause lung cancer."" Soon the pressure was on tobacco companies to stop their advertising campaigns.
In 1955, tobacco sales reached $15 billion in the United States alone. After the Marlboro Man was presented to the American public, that total reached $20 billion. This increase was largely based on the Marlboro Man campaign. The company also started an advertising scheme offering authentic Marlboro Man equipment for sale. These goods were of high quality that attracted the type of person outdoors. The team varied from camping equipment, hats, to outdoor clothing. He was very successful in his time. However, this success had a great cost. Four men who portrayed Marlboro Man died of lung cancer, earning Marlboro cigarettes as the cowboy killer. Marlboro Man is still popular in some parts of Europe and Japan, where smoking is still in vogue.",C1
"Standing on the edge of space over the deserts of New Mexico, Felix Baumgartner stopped slightly. It was a small step away from the capsule, but a 24-mile drop to Earth. Our guardian angel will take care of you, said the control of the mission, and the man known as Felix Intrepid jumped.
Ten minutes later, the Austrian returned to Earth, reaching speeds of up to 725 mph, and breaking three world records, including becoming the world's first supersonic paratrooper by breaking the sound barrier in Mach 1.24. “We love you Felix,” applauded the control room as her mother, Ava Baumgartner, cried. Baumgartner, who claimed the records for the higher altitude and paratrooper balloon manned flight, raised his arms in a victory salute to thank his team.
He was wearing a specially designed survival suit that kept his body intact against the enormously varied pressures that marked his return to Earth. Without her, her blood would have boiled and her lungs could have exploded. Baumgartner later said at a press conference: “When I was standing there at the top of the world, you become so humble, you don’t think about breaking records.” He admitted that all he could think about was coming back alive, but he added: “Sometimes you have to go up too high to see how small you are.”
After two aborted attempts the previous week, the mission was cleared on Sunday morning with climate cooperation. Baumgartner was transported to the crystal clear sky by a giant balloon, measuring 30 million square cubic feet and whose skin was one tenth of the thickness of a sandwich bag. At the bottom of the balloon was a capsule, where Baumgartner sat in his suit.
As he reached the desired height, Baumgartner went through a list of 40 articles with his mentor Joe Kittinger, the previous holder of the higher altitude balloon manned flight.
There was some concern that a heater for his visor was not working, causing his visor to cloud. “This is very serious, Joe,” he told Kitttinger. “Sometimes it gets cloudy when I exhale. ... I don’t feel hot.” But they decided to move on, watched by a record 8 million people as the jump was broadcast live on YouTube.
The two-and-a-half-hour journey upwards, during which the curvature of the Earth became visible and the skies gradually turned black, was paired with a faster descent.
Three cameras connected to Baumgartner's suit recorded his free fall of just over four minutes, which failed to break the record of free fall existing for a long time, and then the parachute opening.
The success of the mission, and of the suit, raises the prospect that astronauts could survive a high-altitude disaster of the kind that hit the Columbia space shuttle in 2003 by actually rescuing themselves from their ship. Baumgartner's best doctor at the trick was Dr. Jonathan Clark, whose wife Laurel Clark died in the Columbia accident. Clark is now engaged in improving the chances of survival of astronauts in a high-altitude disaster.
Baumgartner has made himself a name with acts of boldness. The former paratrooper has parachuted out of buildings and mountains and once into a 600-foot deep cave. He had already practiced two free falls in preparation for this attempt: one from 71,000 feet in March and one from 97,000 feet in July 2012. But no feat can have coincided with his jump above the city of Roswell, a conveniently chosen place famous for his connections with UFO sightings.
He pursued five different albums: the first human to break the sound barrier in free fall; the highest free fall altitude jump; the highest manned balloon flight; the longest free fall; and his jump platform is believed to be the largest manned balloon in history. The trick, which was seven years in planning and sponsored by Red Bull drinks, beat two of Kittinger's records: the retired colonel of the U.S. Air Force. previously had records of height and skydiving speed. Kittinger jumped from a balloon 19 miles above the planet in 1960. Conveniently, the only voice on Baumgartner's radio headset guiding his ascent was that of Kittinger, now 84.
Asked after the jump what I wanted to do next, Baumgartner said: “I want to inspire a generation. I'd like to be sitting in the same place for the next four years as Joe Kittinger. There is a young man who asks me for advice because he wants to break my record.” He said the most exciting moment for him had been when he was standing outside the capsule “at the top of the world.” To laugh, he added: “The most beautiful moment was when I was standing in the landing area and Mike Todd [the life support engineer who dressed Baumgartner in his suit] appeared and had a smile on his face like a little boy.”
Baumgartner said he had come to feel like Todd’s son, adding, “I was so happy he was alive.” Earlier, Todd had told the press conference: “The world needs a hero right now, and they have one at Felix Baumgartner.” To keep laughing at the press conference, Kittinger said: “I would like to give a special one-finger greeting to all the people who said that he [Baumgartner] was going to fall apart when he became supersonic.”
“This will be the last leap,” Baumgartner said. He has promised to settle down and enjoy his years after the jumps with his girlfriend, Nicole Oetl, flying helicopters on rescue missions in the United States and Austria.

"2009 has given employers and employees a career for their money -- literally. Budgets had been cut, layoffs and permits had been put in place, and profits and benefits had evaporated.
Earlier this year, 38 percent of employers said the economy would force them to make administrative cuts sometime during 2009, according to a CareerBuilder.com survey.
Sixty-five percent of those employers indicated that they would reduce the company's social events, 61 percent anticipated the reduction in business travel, 25 percent expected to reduce health care benefits, and 11 percent planned to reduce welfare benefits.
Other areas in which companies planned to cut expenses included special office benefits, such as coffee, ice machines or discounted sales - LRB- 34 percent -RRB-, incentive trips -LRB- 28 percent -RRB- and philanthropic activities -LRB- 21 percent -RRB-.
These advantages and benefits that are taken away from them make the situation difficult for employees. Not only are they working harder to maintain their jobs, but workers have to do more for less. While some argue that it is difficult to keep employees motivated in this situation, others say they should not focus on incentives, but rather think about the overall picture.
When benefits and benefits are taken away, management often does this to allocate resources where they are needed, elsewhere. The money you save by not buying bagels every Friday or buying Christmas gifts for employees can go toward your salary, said Tom Gimbel, founder and CEO of LaSalle Network, a staff and hiring company.
If you had to choose between taking a pay cut and not having free coffee versus being let go, most employees would probably take the first.
Urmil Tracy Marshall, coordinator of the Bureau of Diversity and International Affairs at Fort Valley State University in Fort Valley, Georgia, agrees that it is important not to focus on what is being removed. He said that due to budgetary constraints, licences were applied at school; but instead of being discouraged, he focused on the positive.
“I remembered how blessed I was to have a job,” Marshall said. We have to remember our priorities in life, placing greater emphasis on what we have, not on what we don't do.
Communication is key
Although it is understandable for employees to be upset, frustrated and discouraged when benefits or benefits are removed, Kevin Sheridan, founder and CEO of HR Solutions, who specializes in helping organizations keep employees engaged, said that employees are less likely to be upset if management communicates with employees.
In fact, 82% of employees surveyed at HR SolutionsInternational Normative Database say it is important for their organization to allow them to choose from a variety of benefits to meet their individual needs. The survey consisted of more than 3.3 million responses from 2,400 organizations.
If an organization’s leadership team simply decides among themselves what benefits it would be best to reduce, employees will be upset and their engagement will be negatively affected, says Sheridan. Open communication is a key driver of engagement, and employees will immediately recognize the fact that they had no voice in the situation. If leadership had simply asked employees what benefits were important to them, this situation could be avoided.
Attitude is everything.
Despite having to deal temporarily with a few travel benefits or benefits, there are benefits to staying with your employer until those things are restored.
It's a good time to remember that the advantages were never the reason you liked the job. Nobody gets up in the morning saying, “I’m very excited to go to the office because there is free coffee,” said Paul Glen, author and managing columnist. If people feel that the cuts – LSB-RSB – are being made in a good faith effort to save jobs, they will be even more loyal than before, as they believe the company is working on their behalf, not just for executives.
In addition, according to the HR Solutions survey, 37 percent of employees have thought of resigning in the last six months. Twenty-three percent said they were thinking of leaving because of pay; 18 percent because of a supervisor or manager; 15 percent because of professional promotion; and 5 percent because of benefits. 39 percent considered it for other reasons.
This statistic is especially important because many organizations have reduced profits over the past six months, and illustrates that most employees have not thought of giving up as a result of tight profits, Sheridan said.
These employees recognize the advantages of staying with a company, benefits or not, for advantages such as professional development and compensation. Moreover, as soon as the economy recovers, many benefit programs will be re-evaluated; employees staying with these organizations will not remain without benefits forever.
Workers should also remember that there could be consequences to quit a job just because you lost free coffee or a transportation refund. If you are thinking about quitting your job for such reasons, make sure that your lost advantages outweigh any possible career advancement or opportunities you would receive if you stayed.
In this economy, it can be very difficult to find another job, and there is no guarantee that one will have free coffee, either, Glen said. In addition, in the new job, even if it is good, the employee will have less tenure and is more likely to be reduced in future layoffs.
If you have had benefits or benefits removed in recent months and need help to stay motivated, remember these five tips from our experts:
1. Get over it.
The longer you talk about it to your fellow employees, the longer you will have bad feelings, make others have bad feelings and be less productive yourself, which is not what will help the company be able to restore what has been taken, said Aubrey Daniels, author of Oops! 13 Management practices that waste time and money - LRB- and what to do instead -RRB-.
2. Find the Motivation
Sheridan encourages employees to find motivation through professional planning with supervisors, interact with co-workers, or be proud of where they work. For example, an employee could volunteer to act as a polling board for job candidates who consider employment in the organization.
3. Create your own advantages
Nancy Irwin, a motivational speaker and author, said employees can take turns bringing coffee, bagels or potluck lunches to help fill the void of things that have been cut off.
4. Understand what is still being offered and take advantage of it.
Darcy Eikenberg, president and creative director of coach Darcy LLC, reminds a client who did not enroll in a course because he thought the training costs had been eliminated. He realized that a co-worker was taking the course and getting paid for the tuition reimbursement, an area that had not been cut off. Do a deep dive into your company's programs, policies, and even discounts because there's probably something you can use now, he said.
5. Focus on the solution, not the problem
Focus on today's actions that will affect your organization's success and growth tomorrow, said Jonathan Berger, Human Resources Director of Direct Agents, an interactive advertising company.
Take this time as an opportunity to offer new ideas to your managers and take an active and entrepreneurial role in helping your company overcome tense times. If you do a good job, you can be rewarded for your efforts when things get better, he said. In addition, by taking on new challenges and opportunities, you can develop your skills and become a more valuable asset for any organization.

"Chinese passenger families aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 have participated in a rare nocturnal act of civil disobedience in this heavily controlled city.
After unsuccessfully demanding a meeting with the Malaysian ambassador at his hotel for more than eight hours, angry family members pushed police officers who tried to prevent them from making a midnight march through the Chinese capital. Your destination: the Embassy of Malaysia.
The ambassador kept saying he would come but he never showed up, an old man told CNN that he and many others were walking quietly through the streets of Beijing. As has been the practice of many other Chinese passengers close to their relatives, the man asked not to publish his name.
They're lying. They're lying to us, the man repeated. And now we're going to the embassy. If they don't come to us, we'll go to them.
The surreal night procession was closely followed by police patrols.
Around midnight, more than a hundred relatives organized a sit-in before dawn outside the embassy gates.
Although Chinese security forces far outnumbered the number, relatives continued their stubborn vigil throughout the morning. They remained encamped by the diplomatic mission more than 15 hours later.
Periodically, they sang to fulfill their commitments! No more delays! No more lies! During the sit-in, no Malaysian diplomat went out to meet the protesters.
Protesters finally dispersed peacefully before Friday evening, after camping by the diplomatic mission for more than 17 hours.
The small meeting left after delivering a letter of protest to the embassy demanding an explanation of how the Malaysian Prime Minister has come to the conclusion that the plane ended its flight over the Indian Ocean.
Broken pledges
For weeks, distressed family members have requested face-to-face meetings with Malaysian officials. They demand a report on the details of the last moments before it was believed that flight 370 had disappeared over the Indian Ocean. In the absence of information from Malaysian authorities, many relatives still believe that their missing loved ones are still alive.
On several occasions, in the past two weeks, Malaysian officials in Beijing and Kuala Lumpur publicly committed themselves to meeting with Chinese families within 24 hours, but then failed to report to the talks.
We just want them to stop breaking their promises over and over again, said Steven Wang, family spokesman, whose mother disappeared when Boeing 777 disappeared on March 8.
He spoke to CNN in the area of a journalist outside the sight of the Malaysian Embassy protest. Even early on Friday morning, Chinese police had cordoned off a media area around the corner of the sit-in. During the day, security forces continued to prevent journalists from reaching families.
Public protests are extremely rare in China. The Malaysia Airlines crisis, which has involved the highly emotional disappearance of 153 Chinese citizens on board the plane, has put the Chinese authorities in an uncomfortable position.
The Chinese government has tolerated, but has stopped far from supporting, the political mobilization of the closest relatives of the flight. Families have organized committees, issued press releases and printed T-shirts and hats with the slogan Orar for the MH370. But they have also been largely prevented from organizing public exhibitions outside the hotel's windowless conference room which serves as the improvised family headquarters.
On Friday, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Qin Gang, asked families protesting outside the embassy to express their appeals in a legal and rational manner while committing themselves to providing them with more help. He urged the Malaysian authorities to actively pursue the investigation.

"And now, the rejected.
Photographs show the Boeing VC-25 making a steep bench that is usually not seen with passenger planes
Three months after the White House published a single photograph taken during an Air Force One photo operation flying over New York City, a flight that caused panic on the streets below, the United States Air Force released on Friday the remaining 145 photos taken during the flight.
The photographs show the Boeing VC-25 -- a military version of a 747 -- making three steps next to the Statue of Liberty, at one point accompanied by an F-16 fighter aircraft and at another point making a steep bench that is not usually seen with passenger planes. That last movement may have contributed to the chaos below.
The photographs and several long email channels of the government were published in response to the requests of CNN and other news organizations for the Freedom of Information Act.
E-mail chains show that the organizers of the flight government were aware that many New Yorkers feared planes flying low before the April 27 flight, and show a gust of second questions, finger markings, damage control and occasional expressions of regret in the hours immediately after the flight. View a compilation of fixed overflight images
Thanks for the sensitivities notice in the New York area, an Air Force colonel wrote in an email two days before the flight. This is an issue that has also concerned PAG -LSB - the Presidential Air Transport Group -RSB. As a result, their coordination has been substantial.
But while the White House, the army, and numerous federal and local agencies coordinated the escape, the federal government demanded secrecy, preparing a press release that would be distributed only if there were investigations in the media.
These investigations arrived during the morning flight, triggering a rapid chain of emails among government officials.
We need to build some kind of timeline when people realized that if that's possible, an Air Force officer wrote, responding to the public interest.
I agree that... we have to get damage control, but we're not the POC-LSB-RSB contact point, says the answer. I also don't want to become a belly button for NORAD to press this one.
He wrote a top Pentagon spokesman: Nothing like having everyone pointing their finger at someone else so we can all look like a big group of buffoons... can you say Moe, Larry & Curly!!????? !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
In addition to informal e-mail jokes, documents show the regime system used by the Pentagon to monitor and respond to breaking news.
A U.S. North Command document provides this assessment of history: Last 4 hours: Story reported quickly. Covered by AP, CNN, FOX's main news media. Very critical local reports, highlighting the chilling. Local population very critical of the event, due to 9-11 sensitivities.
Continue: Web site blog comments angry better. Twitter search reveals tweets about two commercial planes chasing F-16. Rate of 1 tweet per minute and growing.
It is not possible to take a positive turn. Admit the error, concludes.
In another email, Colonel Scott M. Turner, commander of the Presidential Air Transport Group, was doing just that. Again, my apologies, sir. The real intention here was to honor New York, not cause massive chaos, he says.
The next day, the Northern Command's internal memo included representations of New York's three main tabloids with headlines, Scare Force One, Just Plane Stupid! And what a fool this was!
The photographs published on Friday, meanwhile, show the presidential plane making a steep bank, apparently beyond the 30-degree maximum for Boeing 747s carrying passengers, according to an airline pilot consulted by CNN. This may have contributed to anxiety on the ground.
The Pentagon estimated the cost of the flight at $328,835, which includes the Boeing aircraft and the two fighter planes that accompanied it. But, they said, the hours would have been flown independently, and the expenses would have been accumulated on a different mission.
The VC-25 plane is designated Air Force One only when the president is on board. President Obama was not on the plane during the photo shoot.
After the incident, Louis Caldera, the director of the White House Military Office responsible for the overflight, resigned.
I have come to the conclusion that the controversy surrounding the Presidential Air Transport Group's air photo shoot on New York City has made it impossible for me to effectively direct the White House Military Office, Caldera said in a letter to Obama. In addition, it has become a distraction for the important work you are doing as president. After a lot of reflection, I think it's up to me to file my resignation and resign as director of the White House Military Office.

"Five Clichés of Horror Movies
Since almost the beginning of the cinema, we've had scary movies. Of all the genres that exist, horror is perhaps one of the most conventional. Many horror movies are based on specific plot devices, also called tropes, to scare their audience. When a trope is used too much, it can become a cliché. But when used well, it can really make us jump off our skin. Here are some of the most used, and perhaps abused, clichés in horror movies.
1
No matter what kind of house it is, the basement is a scary place in horror movies. Usually, that's where something hides or where the evil psychopath has hidden his tools. The basements are always dark and often humid. You can only reach them by a narrow staircase. And basements are always creepy, even when there's nothing down there.
2
In the older horror films, when the protagonists were desperate, it was difficult or impossible for them to ask for help or call the police. Mobile phones have made that situation a little less credible now. What is the solution to keep the suspense going? No phone coverage! If you're a hero in a horror movie, it's almost certain that at a key moment, just when you absolutely need to ask for help, you won't have any coverage at all. Or your phone battery will die just like you're making the call. Or both.
3
Horror movies love uninhabited places. This could be an abandoned hospital, an empty house of fear or a ghost town. There's something in lonely, empty places. What was it like when people lived there? Why did they leave? Maybe it's also that they're so quiet, they can also be very scary. Of course, abandoned places are also useful for horror movie directors in the sense that it is more credible that you will not have phone coverage there either (see above).
4
The hero's been driving for hours. It's night and it's starting to rain. Suddenly he sees a person on the side of the road. Maybe the company will keep him awake? In horror movies, taking a walk to someone is looking for trouble. The hero always does, and it always ends badly.
5
This horror film cliché was especially popular among the horror films of the late 20th century. It starts with a group of teenagers enjoying themselves, and ends with all the dead except one girl. At first, the child is often innocent, shy and not particularly strong. In the end, he has become the hardest and most resourceful person in the world. The last girl almost always wins in the end.",C1
"The best-selling title on Amazon in the U.S. It's not Harper Lee's second most anticipated novel, Go Set to Watchman, nor George RR Martin's song from the ice and fire fantasy series, not even Zoella very moody but very bought young adult success, Girl Online. Instead, Scottish illustrator Johanna Basford is beating the charts with her color books for adults, taking the top positions on Amazon.com's bestseller lists.
The intricate flora and fauna drawings of Basford at Secret Garden have sold 1.4 million copies worldwide to date, and the newly released enchanted forest has already sold just under 226,000 copies. They have attracted fans of Zooey Deschanel, who shared a link about the book with her Facebook followers, to South Korean star Kim Ki-Bum, who posted an Instagram image for her 1.6 million followers.
“It’s been crazy. The last few weeks since the Enchanted Forest came out have been total madness, but fantastic madness,” said Eleanor Blatherwick, head of sales and marketing at the book publishing house, the small British press Laurence King. “We knew the books would be beautiful, but we didn’t realize it would be such a phenomenal success.”
And not only is Basford reaping the benefits of the adult hordes that, it turns out, just wanted something to color. In the UK, Richard Merritt’s Coloring Book of Artistic Therapy ranks fourth on Amazon’s bestseller lists, Millie Marotta’s Animal Kingdom – detailed photos of colored animals – ranked seventh and a mental coloring book ranked ninth. Basford's titles are in second and eighth place – that's half of Amazon.co.uk top ten taken by adult coloring books.
In UK independent editor Michael O’Mara, who has sold nearly 340,000 adult books to date, Chief of Advertising, Marketing and Online, Ana McLaughlin, attributes madness to the way the category has been reimagined as a means of relaxation. “The first we did was in 2012, Creative Coloring for Grown-Ups. It was sold strongly and reprinted, but it was in 2014 that everything really spread with Art Therapy. It really took off for us – selling the anti-stress angle gave people permission to enjoy something they might have felt was quite childish,” he said.
The book Mindfulness Colouring Book pushes this perspective in a particularly strong way, as its publisher tells readers that it is “full of templates for exquisite scenes and sophisticated and intricate patterns, prompting them to meditate on their artworks while filling these pages consciously and creatively, ” and urges potential colorants to “take a few minutes of their day, wherever they may be, and color their way to peace and calmness. ”
“I think it’s really relaxing to do something analogous, disconnect,” Basford said. “And it’s creative. For many people, a blank leaf is very discouraging; with a colorful book, you just have to bring the color. Besides, there's a little nostalgia there. So many people have told me that they used to do the secret coloring when their children were in bed. Now, it's socially acceptable; it's a category of its own. These are adult books. The art in my books is super intricate.”
The illustrator, who lives in Aberdeenshire, has been amazed at the reaction since she launched Secret Garden in 2013. “I had a children’s book in charge and told them that I would like to make one for adults. It wasn't really a trend then. I prepared the first story and they thought, 'Let's go get it.' I was just thinking that people like me would like to do it. My intention was to make a book I'd like to have. So it has been a real surprise to see the category flourish.”
He is currently working on a third book and Michael O’Mara, who already has 17 adult color books in circulation, will increase this to 22 by May, with upcoming titles including the Classic Comic Coloring Book and The Typography Coloring Book. “It’s just a huge trend and shows no signs of deceleration,” McLaughlin said, adding that those who buy the titles are willing to show their ability to stay within the lines of the world in general.
“Photos are all over Twitter and Instagram. People are very proud of them – they are so intricate,” he said. “You don’t have to have any artistic talent, but what you think is unique. People send us pictures of them, framed and laminated. The appetite is simply enormous. I think people are taking their children’s photos out of the fridge and replacing them with theirs.”

"Trucks transporting supplies to NATO troops crossed from Pakistan to Afghanistan for the first time in seven months on Thursday after Islamabad agreed to reopen routes, officials said.
The four trucks, under strong security, crossed the border from Chaman in Balochistan Province, Pakistan.
Because Afghanistan is a landlocked country, many supplies for NATO-led troops fighting Islamic militants have to be transported from Pakistan.
On Tuesday, Islamabad decided to reopen the crucial closed supply routes on 27 November, a day after coalition forces mistakenly killed 24 Pakistani troops.
The incident plunged relations between the United States and Pakistan to a low historical level.
Pakistani routes offer a shorter and more direct route than NATO has been using since November that passed through Russia and other nations, completely avoiding Pakistan.
It's costing the U.S. $100 million more a month to use alternative routes to the north.
Imran Khan, founder of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf-LRB-Movimiento por la Justicia-RRB party, criticized the decision to reopen the routes, saying it was done without meeting the conditions set by Parliament.
He also criticized the current government for being a pawn of the United States.
Talks to reopen routes had stalled on two key issues: Pakistan ' s demand to load more per container shipped across its border, and Pakistan ' s demand that the United States apologize for the friendly fire incident in November 2011.
Pakistani Taliban threaten to reopen NATO supply routes
On Tuesday, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton apologized.
We regret the losses suffered by the Pakistani military. We are committed to working closely with Pakistan and Afghanistan to prevent this from happening again, Clinton's statement said.
Until his apology, the U.S. government had only expressed regret for the incident, but had not issued a direct apology.
Under Tuesday's announcements, Pakistan agreed not to impose any transit charges with the routes reopened, Clinton said in a statement.
The Pakistani route costs about $250 per truck. Pakistan has been seeking $5,000 per truck as a condition for reopening supply lines, which the United States refuses to pay.
The U.S. military will now pay Pakistan $1.1 billion that it owes as part of the agreement reached to reopen NATO supply lines, according to U.S. officials who were aware of the details of the agreement but were not allowed to speak publicly.
The money is part of a U.S. military program called coalition support funds, which reimburses the Pakistani military for their counter-terrorism efforts. The United States stopped paying Pakistan's bills as tension increased between the two countries.
The Pentagon will consult with Congress on the payment of bills before paying Pakistan in full, according to one of the U.S. officials.
Meanwhile, the Pakistani Taliban have threatened to attack NATO trucks, saying that supplies are used to attack their members fighting the occupation in Afghanistan.
Carriers who resume supplies will be considered friends of the United States and face the consequences, a spokesman for the militant group said Wednesday.
The Taliban have attacked NATO supplies in the past, killing drivers and other crew members.

"The quiet chorus of the natural world is in danger of being lost to today's generation as people project the noises around them, warns a high-level U.S. researcher.
The rise in background noise levels in some areas threatens to cause people to ignore the uplifting sounds of bird singing, dripping water, and trees that burrow in the wind, which can often be heard even in urban centers, said Kurt Fristrup, a senior scientist at the United States National Park Service.
The problem was exacerbated by people listening to music through their headphones instead of tuning in with birds and other sounds of nature that can easily be drowned by traffic, music and other noises, he said.
“This learned deafness is a real problem,” Fristrup told the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in San José. “We are being conditioned to ignore the information that reaches our ears.”
“This gift with which we are born – reaching out and listening to things hundreds of meters away, all these incredible sounds – is in danger of being lost through a generational amnesia,” he said.
“There is a real danger, both of hearing acuity loss, where we are exposed to noise for so long that we stop listening, but also a loss of listening habits, where we lose the ability to interact with the environment the way we were built,” he added.
Over the past ten years, the United States National Park Service has recorded sound levels at over 600 sites in the United States, including Yosemite in California, Yellowstone and Denali in Alaska. None were affected by any form of noise from human activity, whether flying over planes, motorcycles, motorboats or tourist buses.
The Fristrup team combined the sound levels recorded in national parks with similar urban environment data to create a noise level model in the United States. They predict that noise pollution is growing faster than the U.S. population and more than double every 30 years.
“It’s not surprising that people are putting on headphones or even that noise cancels headphones to try to create a quieter or more pleasant environment,” he said.
“As you raise background sound levels, it has the same effect on your hearing that fog would have on your vision. Instead of having this expansive experience of all the sounds around you, you are aware of just one small area around you,” he said. “Even in most of our cities, there are birds and things to appreciate in the environment, and there may be very rich natural choirs to pay attention to. And that’s getting lost.”
People quickly get used to changes in their environments, including rising noise levels, and, over time, Fristrup fears that we will accept far worse environmental conditions than we should and forget how much quieter the world could be. “If finding peace and quiet becomes difficult enough, many, many children will grow up without the experience and I think it’s a very real problem,” he said.
The warning came as other scientists reported beneficial health effects of listening to natural sounds. Speaking at the same meeting, Derrick Taff, a social scientist at Pennsylvania State University, described preliminary experiments suggesting that listening to recordings of national parks, waterfalls, bird singing and wind, helped people recover from stressful events.
In one experiment, Taff told the participants who visited his lab to give an impromptu talk that would be judged by researchers behind a one-way mirror. Measurements of his heart rate and stress hormone, cortisol, before and after the speech found that people calmed down faster when they listened to recordings of nature than when the same audio tracks were interspersed with sounds of road traffic, airplanes and even normal conversation.
“We know that natural sounds are very important to people. These are some of the main reasons why people visit protected areas. They want to hear the natural tranquility, the singing of the birds, and the wind and water,” Taff said. “We can be losing this as people are listening to iPods all the time, but I think the audience is grateful for these sounds. My advice is to go to your protected areas and experience what you're missing.
It is not clear why natural sounds can reassure people, but Fristrup speculates that, over millions of years of evolution, we could have come to associate the quieter sounds of the natural world with safety. “I suspect there is something in these intact soundscapes that reminds our ancestral brains of a safe place, where there is no sense of a predator nearby, and that these more disordered soundscapes are problematic for us because we know that we have lost that surveillance capability,” he said.

"One of Barb’s favorite activities since he moved to the United States was watching television. He especially loved watching the ads. ""You can really buy anything here in America!"" He told his friends. One afternoon he was watching TV and saw an ad that really caught his attention. He showed a cartoon woman throwing and turning. The woman in the ad couldn't sleep because she was busy thinking about the day that had passed and worrying about the next day. Barb wasn't very sure what the ad was advertising. Was it a bed? Was it a pillow? Was it just a public service announcement urging people to sleep more? Suddenly a voice on television started talking very quickly, listing the side effects of the sleeping pill the ad was advertising. One of the side effects was insomnia. Barb thought it looked like a strange side effect for a sleeping pill.

The next day, Barb was at the local pharmacy in the neighborhood picking up some stuff. He recalled the announcement he had seen the night before for sleeping pills. I was walking down the halls looking for them. Ever since he saw it advertised on TV, he thought he could prove it. Sometimes it was hard for him to sleep. When he could not find the pills on his own, he approached the pharmacy counter and asked the pharmacist where he could find the pills.
""Do you have a prescription?"" the pharmacist asked. Barn explained that he didn't, but he saw the pills advertised on TV and thought he'd try them. ""Those are not available at the counter,"" the pharmacist explained. Barb thought it was silly that there was an ad for something he couldn't go to the store. He left the pharmacy without buying anything.",C1
"Some of the most important milestones in the United States include feats of modern architecture and engineering. San Francisco, California, is a beautiful city on its own, but it is also home to The Golden Gate Bridge, a 1.7-mile suspension bridge connecting the San Francisco Peninsula to the Marín Headlands. The bridge has the title of one of the Wonders of the Modern World according to the American Society of Civil Engineers.
One of the most popular ways to appreciate the bridge is to make an excursion to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area on the outskirts of San Francisco. The park contains hiking trails, excellent picnic spots, and offers some of the best views for panoramic photos of the bridge leading to the city.
David recently had some friends visit him in San Francisco, and made sure to include a visit to the recreational area as part of his tour. They enjoyed walking along the trails, observing part of the native fauna, and even having a casual picnic in the park. David's friends thanked him for guiding them through this stunning area of California. They made sure to take a group picture with the Golden Gate Bridge in the background. David’s friends had the picture framed, and later presented it to David to thank him for his hospitality during his stay.",C1
"Facebook is expanding its gift function to include plastic gift cards that carry balances for multiple shops and restaurants.
Cards only work in four stores so far: Target, Jamba Juice, Sephora and The Olive Garden. So if you've been wondering how to give your little sister a birthday gift that combines fruit smoothies, lip gloss and unlimited breadsticks, this product is for you.
When you buy a card on the social network for a friend, they receive a message informing them of the gift immediately -LRB- ideal for scrambling at the last minute -RRB-. The cash amount is loaded on a plastic card that is delivered in the mail, probably in some kind of paper envelope.
The recipient can then take that physical card in a physical store and buy physical goods. For an Internet company, everything is deliciously outdated.
The cards will be gradually deployed to Facebook users in the United States.
Facebook is entering a field full of people and offers a couple of features to differentiate itself from other gift cards. The gift giver can choose which of the stores available to give money to -- say $5 to cover a drink in Jamba Juice and $20 for home items in Target. The recipient can monitor the balances on your card from the Facebook app -LRB-, but they cannot move the money among the sellers, no matter how much they prefer to have mascara than pasta -RRB-. Any amount of gift you receive in the future is automatically added to the same card.
Facebook launched its September gift function for physical products such as chocolate, shirts, flowers and wine, as well as virtual items such as charity donations, Uber credit and Netflix subscriptions. It also offered gift cards for specific suppliers such as Starbucks and iTunes. This new card is different because it will work on multiple retailers, is rechargeable and integrates with the Facebook app.
Although you can see the balance of your card on a smartphone, there are no mobile payment options at this time. Facebook cards are not compatible with existing mobile payment technology such as NFC, QR codes or barcodes that allow people to pay for goods with their mobile phone. For now, the company adheres to the traditional plastic rectangle and magnetic band technology that is more widely accepted in the United States.
The new product is somewhere between store-specific cards and open gift cards issued by the bank that can be used in almost any place where credit cards are accepted.
You can also create some privacy issues. To receive the card, the recipient will have to share their postal address with Facebook, which could make some people uncomfortable.
Gift cards are an easy solution for people who do not have enough time or personal knowledge to choose a specific gift. Like money, you know it'll be useful and there's no danger of getting people something they'll hate. Choosing specific seller cards like a favorite coffee spot or clothing store can be a little more personal than a Visa card to be used anywhere. With this card you can mix and pair stores.
Facebook has been experimenting with all kinds of plans to make money in the past year, such as paying to send messages to strangers. Most of the company's revenue comes from advertising -- 84%, according to the latest profit report -- but it also makes money with games and programs like Facebook Gifts. The social network says it has more than a billion active users, and that is a largely untapped resource.
A Facebook spokesperson said the company had nothing to share about how it's going to make money with the card service. There are no charges for the donor or recipient of gifts, so Facebook is likely to earn a percentage of participating companies.

"A mirror that sends heat to the frigid expanse of space has been designed by scientists to replace the air conditioning units that keep buildings cold on Earth.
Researchers believe that the mirror could reduce the amount of energy used to control air temperatures in business premises and shopping malls by eliminating energy-hungry cooling systems.
About 15 per cent of the energy used by buildings in the United States is used in air conditioning, but research estimates suggest that, in some cases, the mirror could fully compensate for the need for additional cooling.
In a comparison on the roof of the device in Stanford, California, scientists found that, while a black painted surface reached 60C more than the ambient temperature in sunlight and bare aluminum reached 40C more, the mirror was up to 5C cooler than the surrounding air temperature.
“If you cover significant parts of the ceiling with this mirror, you can see how much energy you can save.
You can significantly compensate for the electricity used for air conditioning,” said Shanhui Fan, a photonic expert at Stanford University, who led the development of the mirror. “In some situations, calculations say you can completely compensate for air conditioning.”
Buildings are heated in several different ways. Hot water boilers and cooking facilities release heat in their immediate surroundings. In hot countries, hot air enters through doors and windows. Then there is visible light and infrared radiation from the sun, which also heats buildings.
Stanford's mirror was designed in such a way that it reflects 97% of the visible light falling on it. But, more importantly, it works like a heat radiator. When the mirror heats up, it releases heat to a specific wavelength of infrared light that easily passes through the atmosphere and into space.
To do anything fresh requires what engineers call a heat sink: somewhere to throw away unwanted heat. The heat dissipator has to be cooler than the object that needs cooling or will not do its job. For example, an ice cube will cool a bottle of wine because it becomes a sink for heat in the liquid. Stanford's mirror is based on the ultimate heat sink: the universe itself.
The mirror is built from several layers of thin wafer materials. The first layer is reflective silver. On top of this, layers of silicon dioxide and hafnium oxide alternate. These layers improve reflectivity but also turn the mirror into a thermal radiator. When silicon dioxide is heated, it radiates heat as infrared light at a wavelength of about ten micrometers. Since there is very little in the atmosphere that absorbs at that wavelength, heat passes directly into space. The total thickness of the mirror is about two micrometers or two thousandths of a millimeter.
“The cold darkness of the universe can be used as a renewable thermodynamic resource, even during the hottest hours of the day,” scientists write in Nature. In the tests, the mirror had a cooling power of 40 watts per square metre at room temperature.
When writing in the diary, Fan puts the cost of the mirrors installed between $20 and $70 per square meter and calculates an annual electricity saving of 100MWh in a three-storey building.
Fan said the mirror could cool buildings – or other objects – by simply putting it in direct contact with them. Covering the roof of a building with the mirror would prevent the heating of sunlight, but do little to remove the heat from its interior. Most likely, the mirror was used to cool water or some other liquid that would then be pumped around the building.
He ruled out the idea of using mirrors to stop global warming. “The ceiling space represents only a small portion of the Earth’s surface so, at this point, we don’t think this is a geoengineering solution. Rather, our contribution to the issue of greenhouse gas emissions is simply to reduce electricity consumption,” he said.
“I’m very excited about the potential it has and the applications for cooling,” said Marin Soljačić, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “You can use this in buildings to spend much less on air conditioning or you may not need it at all. You could put it over the malls. With a sufficiently large surface, substantial cooling could be achieved.”

The news of the alleged rogue merchant comes in the midst of a marked economic anxiety in Europe. In recent weeks there have been turbulence in the markets, as there has been increased concern that Greece may default on its huge debt, sending shock waves across the eurozone of 17 nations and beyond.
Impact of traders on UBS
US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner will attend a meeting of the European Economic and Financial Affairs Council in Wroclaw, Poland, on Friday, at which issues on Greek debt and financial stability in the eurozone will be discussed.
Also present are the finance ministers of the Member States of the European Union, the presidents of the central banks and representatives of other important financial bodies. The conference is ahead of the G20 and IMF meetings at the end of this month.
On Thursday, even when news was circulating about the incident in UBS, it was learned that the Federal Reserve and four other powerful central banks announced that they were throwing a lifeguard at the banks fighting in Europe.
The European Central Bank, together with the Fed, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank, said three US dollar auctions would be held to help European banks in need of the currency to finance loans and pay off debt.
European banks have seen the US dollar flow as US financial institutions and money market accounts reduce exposure to European banks, amid fears by those institutions that expose debt in the hands of Greece and other European nations.

As for the epidode in UBS, Silva, the analyst, described three possible ways in which such a large loss could occur: intentional fraud, basic stupidity in the trading strategy, or what the banking industry calls fat fingers, which means writing the wrong number by accident.
Maybe the trader put an extra zero so instead of buying a million he or she bought ten million -- it could be a problem, Silva said.
Lex van Dam, a former merchant who is now a partner of Hampstead Capital in London, said that market chaos could have put more pressure on a trader desperate to hold on to his work.
Trading has been incredibly difficult over the past year, Van Dam said. With the volatility of bank stocks, raw materials and currencies, things can go wrong very, very easily. If you are concerned about your work and try to hide -LRB - a mistake or loss -RRB-, you can see how these situations arise.
The risk management division of a bank is supposed to examine the activities of a trader, he said.
“He must have done something he should not have done, obviously,” Van Dam said.
UBS said that no customer position was affected by the loss, which is still being investigated.
But unauthorised trade by a trader in his investment bank could cause UBS to post a loss in the third quarter of this year, he said.
The loss could be one of the biggest costs for a bank in unauthorized trade.
The fashion trader Jerome Kerviel cost his French bank, Societe Generale, nearly $6 billion, and was sentenced to three years in prison last year.
Yasuo Hamanaka cost Sumitomo Corporation $2.6 billion in the world copper market, and was sent to prison for eight years for fraud and forgery in 1997.
Nick Leeson, the subject of Ewan McGregor Rogue Trader's film, lost about $1.3 billion to his bank, Barings, in 1995, forcing it to close.
UBS is not likely to collapse, but the scandal could push the bank to split its investment bank into a separate company, van Dam said.
There is a much greater probability that this bank will now be divided into a wealth management company and an investment bank to reduce customer exposure to investment bank losses, he said.
He favors that alternative, he said.
The banks are too big, Van Dam said. The products are so complicated, and the management doesn't understand it.
UBS earned a pre-tax profit of about $1.9 billion in the second quarter of this year, announced in July, compared to $2.5 billion in the previous quarter.

"A bachelor's degree in Spanish got me my first job as a journalist, with an international press agency in Mexico City, but it didn't stop me from making a mistake as a novice journalist.
I just arrived in the Mexican capital after a Greyhound bus ride from New York and the job interview was a test of my language skills. In my new role, the day shifts were spent in the streets at political rallies and the nights were spent alone in the office, coordinating the coverage of El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala and the rest of Central America. However, I also had to report on occasional disasters: fires, floods and explosions in reconstruction factories.
It was as a journalist that I soon discovered that it was as bad to understand the numbers in Spanish as to calculate them in English. The phone calls to the police took the Mexican grandmothers out of bed at 2 a.m. because she had misinterpreted a number and dialed a dubious digit. Worse still, the victims were too high in my stories – almost 83 dead in a fi re at 6pm turned out to be only 38 by 7pm; 12 people injured in a car accident soon became two and so it continued. Finally, I got a call from the head office in Washington. “I don’t know what training you’ve had,” one editor shouted, “but no one has told you that a number of dead can’t come down? !""
Why are the numbers in another language so riddled? It may have to do with different numbering systems. If we consider that, in German, for example, which belongs to the same Indo-European language family as English, the 2.30 am become halb drei (half of three) and 21 become einundzwang (one and twenty), clearly different numerical systems can cause confusion and that without even considering indigenous languages with so rare numerical systems that they are in danger of extinction.
Some experts believe that there is a link between dyscalculia – the difficulty of understanding arithmetic – and the problems of learning foreign languages, especially if languages are learned by memory, as this implies the sequential processes with which students with disccalculia struggle. But, some students who struggle to learn languages with a grammar textbook may thrive in a foreign language environment, where learning is more natural and less dependent on sequences of adjectives, prepositions and so on. In my case, I have always found languages quite easy, apart from the numbers.
But, perhaps it is also because numbers in a non-native language are often heard out of context or in isolation, when the listener may have turned off from the foreign language and be unable to tune in suddenly. A survey of multilingual friends straw found that many can be flowered in French or Italian when ordering from a restaurant menu, for example, but freeze if they have to transmit numbers, especially by phone. The numbers seem to be taxed, but no one could really say why.
In my case, the numerical challenge in a foreign language followed me from Mexico to other countries and from Spanish to German and Portuguese. But, in that first journalistic work, wrong numbers didn't always add up to failure.
One night, a Mexican colleague learned that the American consul in the port city of Veracruz was being taken hostage at gunpoint in his office. Without a high-level English-speaking reporter in the office, it remained for me to try to reach the consulate by phone. Having misunderstood the number, they put me to an extension elsewhere in the building and the identity of the person who took my call was unmistakable: I spoke for 15 minutes with the gunman. I may not have persuaded him to put his gun away, but my reputation as a rookie journalist rose overnight.

"Peaches Geldof, daughter of musician Bob Geldof and the deceased Paula Yates, died of a heroin overdose after re-using the illegal drug after attempts to abandon her, an investigation was heard on Wednesday.
The death of the 25-year-old television presenter in April at her home in Wrotham, Kent, southeast of London, shocked the entertainment world.
Chief Inspector Paul Fotheringham of Kent Police told the investigation that Geldof had been addicted to heroin for several years, but had stopped taking the drug more recently.
Geldof, who had two children under 2 years of age, had been supported by drug treatment workers for 2Â 1/2 years, being prescribed methadone, he said. She had said she wanted to leave methadone completely and was following a reduction plan.
A drug test in November indicated that she was not taking any illegal drugs, she said. However, in February, witnesses reported suspicions that he had returned to heroin use.
High-grade heroin
Fotheringham's report to the investigation gave further details of Geldof's death.
The police who searched the house where he died found a bag of black cloth hidden in a closet above a spare bedroom door, he said.
Inside there was a bag containing what the evidence showed to be heroin, as well as a bag of citric acid, used to make heroin more soluble in water for injection, according to the report. The bag also had dozens of syringes, some sealed, while others contained traces of a brown residue, alcohol wipes, cotton buds and cards announcing a needle exchange in central London.
According to a police drug expert, PC Adrian Parsons, the heroin found was of import quality, i.e. with a purity of 61%, compared to the average purity of 26% found on the street.
The 6.91 grams -LRB- around a quarter of an ounce -RRB- recovered would have been worth #350 to # 550 -LRB- about $600 to $940 -RRB-, said Fotheringham.
Burned spoon, knotted mesh
Geldof was discovered sitting on a bed in the guest bedroom by her husband, rock musician Tom Cohen, who went home after he cared when he could not contact her.
The couple's youngest son, Phahedra, was in the house at the time, having been left by Cohen's father the previous afternoon. The musician had taken both children to spend the weekend at their parents' house.
A pair of knotted black stockings were found under his body, and a burnt spoon containing a small amount of a brown residue in the bowl was found under the bed, Fotheringham said. The socks could have been used as a tourniquet while she was injecting the drug.
An autopsy also found evidence of recent puncture marks inside both elbows and on his left hand.
The investigation heard that evidence from a forensic scientist suggests the recent use of the drug, resulting in a high concentration of heroin in Geldof's body, which was at the end of the range of values in which deaths have occurred.
He was not under the influence of alcohol at the time of his death, they revealed the evidence. Nor had he taken a significant amount of other substances in the hours before his death.
Reduction of tolerance?
The scientific report points out that people who use heroin regularly develop a tolerance to the drug, and such individuals may use doses that would be toxic, or fatal, to people without tolerance.
But he adds that tolerance seems to be lost quite quickly when consumers stop using the drug, and deaths often occur in people who have previously been tolerant and have re-used heroin.
Fotheringham's report concluded, ""There is no indication that any other third party was present or involved in his death and there is no indication that Peaches intended to take his life or harm himself in any way, as it was reported to be of happy disposition and planning for the future with friends and family.
Geldof was 11 years old when his mother died of a drug overdose.
Kent police continue to investigate who supplied Geldof with heroin, but no arrests have been made.

"This week's Bank of the West Classic in Stanford, California, reaches a remarkable milestone when the tournament celebrates its 40th year, the oldest WTA Tour event on the circuit.
The tournament has been organized in Stanford University gardens for the past 14 years, after several different locations in the North California area, and its list of former winners is read as a who's - who of women's tennis.
Martina Navratilova holds the record for most single titles, with five between 1979 and 1993.
The U.S. Open Champion Kim Clijsters has four wins, with American legends Chris Evert and Lindsay Davenport and Billie Jean King with three wins each.
And, in recognition of having reached the milestone, the tournament organizers have organized a special presentation before the semi-finals on Saturday, July 31.
Four former champions, each representing a different decade, will be paraded; inuaugural champion King -LRB-1970s -RRB-, twice champion Andrea Jaeger -LRB-1980s -RRB-, Davenport -LRB-1990s -RRB- and defending champion Marion Bartoli -LRB-2000s -RRB-.
It was appropriate for King to win the initial tournament, as he had fought so hard for the introduction of the WTA Tour.
And, the 1971 tournament at the San Francisco Civic Auditorium, in which King defeated Rosie Casals in the final of an event then known as the British Motor Cars Invitational, became the first of 24 events that year that formed the first WTA Tour calendar.
The tournament became California's Virginia Slims in 1974 and its headquarters moved through the San Francisco area before settling in the Oakland Coliseum between 1979 and 1996.
The tournament has continued to grow and grow since moving to Stanford, with Stanford Tennis Director Dick Gould saying to the local Mercury News website: It has been a great marriage and almost every great player for the last 14 years has played here.
It's been really great not just for Stanford, but for the Northern California community in general.
Australian Samantha Stosur is the main seed for the 2010 version, although the injury means that the Williams sisters -- who are so much from the area -- will not be in action.

"The United States government consists of three main sections. It is based on the Constitution of the United States of America which entered into force in May 1789. The three parts of the United States Government are the executive, legislative and judicial branches. Each branch works independently of the other two, and each has its own responsibilities. This system is in place to ensure that no branch can have more power than the other. This is called the separation of powers, which was written in the Constitution.

The executive branch is the branch with which most Americans are familiar. It includes the President of the United States, the Vice President and the Cabinet. The president is the leader of the country and the commander-in-chief of the U.S. military. The vice president is second in command, and will act as president if the president dies, resigns or is dismissed. The Cabinet acts as agents of the President of the United States and performs the functions entrusted to it.
The legislature consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Together they form the congress, which can collect taxes, mint money and establish federal courts. It can also declare war, and raise and support the army, navy and air force to protect the country. The House of Representatives has 435 members, and the Senate is composed of 100 senators, with two from each of the states. Any legislation, or new law, must be passed by both the House of Representatives and the Senate.",C1
"A Florida jury awarded a 92-year-old man $1.9 million in compensatory damages for the death of his wife, a former two-pack Marlboro smoker a day she started when she was 16 and died in her 70s, lawyers said on Thursday.
A jury awarded a 92-year-old man $1.9 million in compensation for the death of his wife.
The jury of five women and a man deliberated for a little more than a day before deciding the amount, lawyers on both sides said. The jurors put the total prize at $5.3 million, but found that Philip Morris USA was only 36.5 percent responsible for lung cancer that the plaintiffs said killed Leon Barbanell's wife.
Shirley Barbanell herself was held 63.5 percent responsible, lawyers said.
Jonathan Gdanski, the plaintiff's attorney, said the jury found a design defect and a breach of warranty.
Philip Morris announced that he plans to appeal the case, one of the thousands of cases of Engle's progeny, named after a 2006 Florida Supreme Court decision decertifying a collective lawsuit against the tobacco industry. That case involved Dr. Howard A. Engle, a Miami Beach pediatrician and smoker who served as the main plaintiff in the class action.
The decertification decision allowed former class members to file individual lawsuits, and thousands did.
The Florida Supreme Court also allowed some factual findings about smoking causing disease to be taken from the Engle case and applied to progeny cases so that plaintiff's attorneys don't have to start from scratch in each of these cases, said Ed Sweda, a lawyer for the Tobacco Product Responsibility Project in Boston, Massachusetts.
The industry has resisted that. Today's verdict is the result of a severely damaging trial plan, said Murray Garnick, senior vice president of Altria Client Services and associate general adviser, speaking on behalf of Philip Morris USA, in a written statement. From beginning to end, this case was marked by legal judgements that must be overturned on appeal, including allowing this jury to rely almost exclusively on the findings of an earlier jury that have no direct relationship with the plaintiff in this case.
So far, six of Engle’s eight cases that have gone to trial have returned with the verdict of a plaintiff, Sweda said. Another group is ready to be tried this year, he said.
On Thursday's verdict, he said, ""This is certainly a clear indication that the tobacco dispute is alive and well.
Gdanski said his firm has over 150 cases of Engle. “We are more than happy to keep trying,” he said.

"Do you want your child to be good at sport, make the school team and, maybe one day, even compete on the world stage? Well, try to make sure that your aspiring Olympic or World Cup winner is born in November or, failing that, in October. A study conducted by one of the UK's leading experts in children's physical activity has found that school pupils born in those months are more fit than all others in their class.
Children born in November and October emerged as fitter, stronger and more powerful than their peers born in the other ten months of the year, especially those whose birthdays fell in April or June. Dr. Gavin Sandercock of the Sports and Exercise Science Center at the University of Essex and his colleagues discovered that children born in the autumn enjoyed “a clear physical advantage” over their classmates.
The research involved 8,550 boys and girls between 10 and 16 years of age from 26 State schools in Essex. All were tested between 2007 and 2010 in three different fitness measures: resistance, manual gripping force and lower body power. The results revealed that a child’s month of birth could make “significant” differences in his or her levels of cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength and ability to accelerate, all of which predicts how good someone is in the sport, in which such attributes are vital. Proceedings on school sports days in the coming weeks can corroborate the results.
The children born in November were the most fit in general, as they had the greatest resistance and power and were the second strongest. Those born in October were almost as fit, scoring more strength and arriving third for power, with the children of December near behind.
The gap in physical skills among children in the same class but born in different months was sometimes very wide. “For example, we find that a child born in November can run at least 10% faster, jump 12% higher and is 15% more powerful than a child of the same age born in April. This is, potentially, a great physical advantage,” said Sandercock. Such gaps could ultimately decide who became a high-level athlete because, as the newspaper says, “selection in elite sports can often depend on very small margins or differences in an individual’s physical performance.”
The study, which has been published in the International Journal of Sports Medicine, found that, when the scores of the three types of physical fitness were combined, those born in April were the least suitable, and then those in June. That could see those kids excluded from school teams and become unsuccessful players, Sandercock said.
The findings seem to show that children born in the first months of the school year enjoy a double “fall advantage” – they are already known to have an academic advantage and, now, also seem better equipped for sport. The results show that more than “the effect of relative age” – the greatest maturity of those born at the beginning of the school year – is at work, especially because the fittest children were not the tallest or the heaviest, he added.
The authors believe that the increased exposure of children born in autumn during the summer months, towards the end of pregnancy, to vitamin D – the “vitamin of the sun” linked to a number of health benefits – is the most likely explanation. “The seasonal differences in intrauterine vitamin D concentrations seem more plausible,” they say. John Steele, executive director of the Youth Sport Trust, said the quality of a young person’s introduction to physical education and sport at school can be “an important factor” in his sports development. “Children who get a first high-quality experience, which develops their physical literacy, are the ones who will have greater agility, balance and coordination, and are more likely to develop a enjoyment of physical activity and excel in sport as they grow up,” he said.
UK Sport could not say whether a disproportionately high number of the 1,300 athletes through 47 sports that the funds were born in November and October. Natalie Dunman, her director of pathways, said that, while the differences highlighted in the new findings were confirmed by teenagers competing in junior level competitions, they had disappeared when athletes participated in adult competitions. She said: “Looking at the elite, high-level athletes, there are many factors that are going to make a champion and our work has discovered nothing to suggest that the month of birth is one of the key ingredients.”

"On the stage, Donald Trump had a surprisingly humble confession to make for someone challenging all the laws of political gravity.
“Unless we win, it doesn’t mean anything,” the Republican presidential candidate warned at a campaign rally in South Carolina, despite having finished his fourth consecutive month at the top of opinion polls. “I want to choose my election date. I want it next Tuesday,” he confided to the crowd of 11,000 people, typical of the popular support that needs to flourish until March 2016 to win the nomination, let alone the November general elections. Such moments of doubt are fleeting, quickly replaced by the now familiar bombat of a billionaire whose status as a “winner” has become its defining political platform.
Trump is not the only one beginning to wonder if his unlikely campaign can confuse experts and reach a distance, particularly after a recent outbreak of controversy only seemed to consolidate his electoral advantage over bewildered rivals. Conventional wisdom holds that any of these outbursts would have already sunk most politicians.
First, there was a time when he outraged the prisoners of war by doubting Vietnam veteran John McCain's heroism because he allowed himself to be captured. Then, there was the first debate on television, where she insulted Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly, because she asked difficult questions.
As if the PoWs, Fox News and women were not enemies enough, Trump has also insulted Mexican immigrants to the U.S., claiming that a Black Lives Matter protester who was violently expelled from a demonstration deserved to be “grown up,” seemed to mock a New York Times journalist for his disability and falsely accused Muslim Americans of applauding the 9/11 attackers.
Trump has complained that many of these incidents were exaggerated by political media, 70% of which, he says, are “scum.” However, it had refused to retract any of the comments. “I could have said, ‘Oh, I spoke badly,’ but I’m not good at it,” Trump told the crowd in South Carolina. Some rivals still hope that, over time, even Trump supporters will tire of what critics consider to be their relentless attacks on minorities in particular. A poll shows their support among Republicans by 12 points – although, with 31%, they continue to lead the field.
Other opponents wonder if Trump has a very broad political ideology. “He is an egomaniac; he is a narcissist. He is not a conservative, he is not a liberal, he believes in himself,” former presidential rival Bobby Jindal told The Guardian shortly before leaving the race.
Liz Mair, a Republican strategist who organizes a fund-raising committee against Trump, is concerned that many of the comments seen as gaffes by the liberal media are, in fact, carefully designed to boost her position with her main constituency. “I personally think it’s better for people who don’t like Trump and his policies to do some work to try to undermine him actively,” he says. “And not just pray that he kills himself politically.”
However, there is more to Trump than the outrage that draws attention. As he delights in telling his supporters, the three issues he criticizes most – immigration reform, free trade agreements, and Barack Obama’s national security policy – have perhaps become the issues that define the elections.
His policies to deport all undocumented immigrants to the United States and demand that Mexico pay for a border wall – “A real wall. A very high wall, taller than that roof.” – It may seem unrealistic, but it may have destroyed Jeb Bush’s campaign hopes, which favors immigration reform.
So what does it take to stop Trump? A source of optimism among opponents is the strong evidence that polls so far from election day are an average of eight percentage points, simply because most people have not decided. Among Americans who identify as Republicans, current polls suggest that they have 25-30% of the votes.
In the battle for the heart and mind, it will be difficult to convert the passionate supporters of Trump. To avoid their advantage, another candidate would have to take advantage of their support base without compromising theirs. Poll experts believe this is unlikely, as it is difficult to imagine someone who makes Trump better than Trump, let alone anyone who does Trump without sacrificing their own support.
This scenario can be better understood by looking at the answers to the question: “Are there any of these candidates who would definitely not support the Republican nomination for president?” While 20-30% of voters say they would support Trump, another 20-30% say they would definitely not.
Steve Deace, a prominent conservative from Iowa, said Trump’s pranks are “a good thing and a bad thing. On the one hand, it produces a loyal follow-up that is attracted to that person who will not leave you. On the other hand, limit your ability to grow beyond that.
The first Republican pollster, Frank Luntz, believes Trump speaks for voters who, for the first time, feel like they have a spokesperson and like the fact that they feel they are being heard. As the pollster points out: “Trump says what you are thinking and, the more outrageous he is, the more you agree with him. He’s saying what no politician would say and that’s another reason they like it.”
That is certainly the sentiment among ordinary supporters who have attended their increasingly crowded campaign events in recent months.
“I like the way he speaks,” says Sandra Murray of Dubuque, Iowa. “This country is a huge disaster and we have to get out of this and, honestly, he could be the man to do it.”
Other supporters offer a simpler explanation. “He is not afraid of anyone or anything. That’s pretty cool.”

"A nasal spray with oxytocin ""Hormone of Love"" could help children with autism learn to better handle social situations, American researchers say. Exploring children with autism spectrum disorder showed that a single dose of the chemical improved brain responses to facial expressions, a change that could make social interactions more natural and rewarding for them.
The scientists behind the research said that an oxytocin course could boost the success of behavioral therapies that are already used to help people with autism learn to cope with social situations. “Over time, what is expected to be seen is a more appropriate social response, being more interested in interacting with other people, more eye contact, and more conversational ability,” said Kevin Pelphrey, director of the Child Neuroscience Lab at Yale University.
Autism is a developmental disorder seen in more than one in 100 people. The condition affects individuals in different ways, but is characterized by difficulties in social interaction and communication. So far, there is no established treatment for social problems caused by autism. Yale researchers have studied brain chemistry oxytocin as a potential treatment for social deficiencies caused by autism because it plays a crucial role in union and trust. However, the results have been mixed: a recent study found no significant benefit for young people given the chemical for several days. But Pelphrey said oxytocin could help the brain learn from social interactions; it would work better when used with therapies that encourage people with autism to become more socially involved, she said.
“Our study shows that oxytocin affects the brain and opens the possibility that, when combined with behavioral treatments, it will function as a social enhancer,” he said. Scientists used a technique called functional MRI to scan the brains of 17 young people aged 8 to 16 years with autism while looking at images of cars or the eyes of people expressing different emotions. The scans were given 45 minutes after participants inhaled placebo or oxytocin through a nasal spray.
The scanners showed that the reward circuits in the children's brains behaved more normally after an oxytocin snort, being more active when the person looked at the faces and less active when he saw the inanimate cars. The study appears in the latest issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in the United States. “If this is replicated, it suggests that oxytocin might treat something so we don’t have a treatment in autism, and that’s the main social motivation,” Pelphrey told the Guardian.
He warned that it was too early to use oxytocin as a treatment for social difficulties caused by autism and warned against buying oxytocin from online suppliers. “We don’t want them to run out on the basis of this or any other study and try oxytocin at home. You don't know what they're buying. We're not even close to thinking this is a ready treatment. He needs more follow-up,” he said. “This is an important new study to identify changes in brain activity in key brain regions involved in the social cognition of autism following the administration of oxytocin,” said Simon Baron-Cohen, director of the Autism Research Center at Cambridge University. A surprising finding, however, is that oxytocin nasal spray did not change performance in social cognitive task. It is also not clear whether oxytocin only has benefits for people with autism or has unwanted side effects.
Finally, the effects of oxytocin only last about 45 minutes, so there may be practical considerations as to whether this could be used as a treatment.
“From a scientific perspective, this study has a lot of evidence of animal and human work to justify serious attention, but more research is needed. Doctors should be cautious about the clinical potential of this hormone until we know much more about its benefits and risks, in much larger studies,” said Simon Baron-Cohen.
Uta Frith, who studies autism at University College in London, said: “According to this study, oxytocin may have the effect of making faces more interesting, as assessed by a greater activity in brain structures that deal with the evaluation of rewards. Disappointingly, this effect is seen only in brain activity and not in behavior. Demonstrate an effect on behavior will be critical if nasal spray treatment is of any value.”

"He is not the first person to express skepticism about Mars One, a very ambitious private mission with the aim of settling humans on Mars from 2025 onwards. But Joseph Roche is different from most critics: he is on the astronaut list.
Roche, an astrophysicist at Trinity College Dublin who was announced in February as one of the 100 people online for the mission, has written for The Guardian expressing serious doubts about Mars One's viability.
The selection process, Roche writes, “was not rigorous enough to reach the required level of the most traditional astronaut selection programs.” He also says that the Dutch Mars One team has shown “some naivety” by believing that they can succeed alone in the so-called $6 billion mission and should now accept that it is highly unlikely to happen.
He writes: “Increased openness and transparency would greatly benefit Mars One, but I believe that the shortcomings of the selection process, along with its lack of willingness to engage and collaborate with the scientific community, mean that the time might have come for Mars One to recognize the implausibility of this particular enterprise and direct its efforts towards supporting other more exciting and viable future space missions.”
Roche also expressed concern about the way in which the organizers of the mission gave publicity to the so-called ten candidates. The ranking, he said, did not mean that these were the most likely potential astronauts, but was based on how many “support points” each had won through acts such as the purchase of official merchandise.
He writes: “These points are Mars One’s points of support that represent the degree of their support for Mars One’s mission.” These points play no role in the selection process and serve only to show how much each supporter has donated to Mars One.”
The official schedule of the mission says that the group plans to send a stationary landing and a satellite to Mars in 2018, followed by a rover in 2020 and cargo missions from 2022. Humans would begin arriving in 2025 and crews of four would be sent every two years to add to the settlement. They wouldn't go back to Earth.
In February, a prominent supporter of the project, Gerard’t Hooft, a Dutch Nobel Prize winner in physics, said he did not believe this calendar was realistic. He said: “It will take a lot longer and will be far more expensive. When they first asked me to get involved, I said, ""You have to put a zero after all.""
Roche also spoke to Medium, an American blogging platform that has previously expressed serious skepticism about Mars One, reporting among other things that the alleged 200,000 applications to be astronauts actually totaled 2,761.
He told Medium about the selection process in more detail: “I have not met anyone from Mars One in person. Initially, they said there were going to be regional interviews; we were going to travel there, they were interviewing us, they were testing us for several days and, in my opinion, that sounded at least like something that was approaching a legitimate astronaut selection process.
“But then they made us sign a confidentiality agreement if we wanted to be interviewed and then suddenly it changed from being a proper regional interview for several days to being a ten-minute Skype call.”
Roche told the Guardian that he did not want to give any more interviews, as he was cautious about being negative about the idea of traveling into space.
In his commentary article, he writes: “I am passionate about pushing the limits of scientific effort and that’s why I was attracted to the ambition of the Mars One plan. Although Mars One was never likely to overcome financial and technical barriers during the proposed timeline, it was refreshing to hear a new idea that challenges us to think about our own role in the future of space exploration.
“Being part of the subsequent public debate on the ethics and morality of future missions has been one of the most interesting and enjoyable aspects of my candidacy with Mars One. If a one-way mission to Mars were possible, then it would always be voluntary. For an astrophysicist, that’s not a hard decision to make, but it’s also a moot point because I don’t think we see a one-way mission in my life.”

"More than one third of women worldwide (35.6%) will experience physical or sexual violence during their lifetime, usually from a man, according to the first comprehensive study of this type by the World Health Organization (WHO). The report reveals the scandalous extent of attacks on women of men with whom they share their lives, and 30 per cent of women are attacked by their partners. It also notes that a large proportion of murders of women (38%) are committed by intimate partners.
“These findings send a powerful message that violence against women is a global health problem of epidemic proportions,” Dr. Margaret Chan, Director-General of WHO. “We also see that the world’s health systems can and must do more for women who suffer violence.”
The highest levels of violence against women are found in Africa, where almost half of all women (45.6 per cent) will suffer physical or sexual violence. In low- and middle-income Europe, the proportion is 27.2%. However, richer nations are not always safer for women: one third of women in high-income countries (32.7%) will experience violence at some point in their lives. Of women who suffer violence, 42 per cent are injured, which can bring them to the attention of health personnel. That, the report says, is often the first opportunity for domestic violence to be detected and for women to be offered assistance. Violence has a profound impact on women ' s health. Some arrive at the hospital with broken bones, while others suffer from complications related to pregnancy and mental illness.
The two WHO reports – one on the prevalence of violence and the other on guidelines to help women – are the work of Dr. Claudia Garcia-Moreno, WHO Senior Specialist in Gender, Reproductive Rights, Sexual Health and Adolescence, and Professor Charlotte Watts, Epidemiologist specializing in Gender, Violence and Health, School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London.
“For the first time, we have compared data from around the world on the extent of partner violence and sexual violence by non-partners and the impact of this type of violence on health,” García-Moreno said. These include HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, depression, women who resort to alcohol, unwanted pregnancies and low birth weight babies.
There were variations in the rates of violence against women in different regions of the world, but, Garcia-Moreno said, “in any region we look at, it is unacceptably high.” Even in high-income countries, 23.2% of women will suffer physical and/or sexual violence from a partner in their lives, according to data from 81 countries. The global number of women attacked by their partners was 30 per cent.
More sexual assaults and rapes by acquaintances or strangers are reported in high-income countries than in other countries – the report says that 12.6% of women in rich countries will be sexually assaulted by a non-partner in their lives, which is higher than the African rate of 11.9%. However, data on such crimes are not well collected in all regions.
The authors claim that their previous research shows that women with better education are less likely to suffer violence, as are those with work, but not in all regions. There is a need to address social norms, Watts said. “What is society’s attitude towards the acceptability of certain forms of violence against women?” he asked. “In some societies, it’s not right, but not all.”
“I think the numbers are a wake-up call for us all to pay more attention to this issue,” García-Moreno said. Over the past decade, there has been growing recognition of the problem, he said, but “it must be recognized that it is a complex problem. We don’t have a vaccine or a pill. ”
The new WHO clinical and policy guidelines recommend that health personnel be trained to recognize signs of domestic violence and sexual assault, but rule out general screening: there are no cases to ask all women who arrive at a clinic if they have been subjected to violence.
“But if you see a woman come back several times with undisclosed injuries, you should be asking about domestic violence,” García-Moreno said. “When I was training at medical school, it wasn’t something you learned or knew. Years later, I sometimes found myself in a situation where I could say that there was something else in the woman I was interviewing, but it made no sense that domestic violence was the problem. Now, I think I would take care of the interview in a very different way.”",C1
"What skills will the workforce of the future need?
As technological innovations continue to change the workplace, we see more industries entrust their operations to new devices, software and programs that can transform the workplace. One of those technologies that has the potential to revolutionize workplaces in the coming years is RPA (Automatization of Robotic Processes). With more industries starting to adopt RPA software, RPA robots would be able to handle mundane and repetitive tasks as part of administrative work normally handled by administrative staff, thereby reducing operating costs and increasing productivity.
There is a common concern that companies using technology such as RPA are only interested in increasing their profit margins by reducing costs, and that this trend would eventually leave most of the labour force unemployed. However, while it is true that the minor tasks of administrative and administrative work are likely to be undertaken through automation, the requirements of the average office worker will evolve to include more creative work, management tasks and communication with customers and suppliers.
With this shift in focus, the skills required for future workers are also required to change. Moving away from basic data entry skills, the worker of the future is expected to have transferable problem-solving and critical thinking skills that enable him to address any difficult situation and work independently to find solutions.
The ability to adapt and be agile would also be essential in a world that is likely to become increasingly volatile, uncertain and complex. Having such flexibility, along with the desire to continue learning and the initiative to take a step forward, the successful worker of the future is the one who will be able to use his skills to seek opportunities, make improvements and take on new challenges wherever they work.
By equipping our future generation of workers with such entrepreneurial skills, we can ensure that when automation takes full charge, our workers will have survival skills to become better employees and leaders of the future.",C1
"If the amount of food wasted around the world were reduced by only 25%, there would be enough food to feed all people who are undernourished, according to the UN. Each year 1.3 billion tons of food is wasted, about one third of all food produced, including about 45 per cent of all fruit and vegetables, 35 per cent of fish and seafood, 30 per cent of cereals, 20 per cent of dairy products and 20 per cent of meat. Meanwhile, 795 million people suffer from severe hunger and malnutrition.
Widespread attempts to combat food loss, such as recent laws in France requiring supermarkets to distribute unsold food to charities, have highlighted the problem of food waste, identified by the UN as one of the major challenges to achieving food security. Estimates suggest that by 2050, food production will have to have increased by 60% over 2005 levels to feed a growing world population.
Reducing food waste would alleviate the burden of resources while the world sought to meet future demand. The problem is global but manifests itself in very different ways. In developing countries, there are high levels of what is known as “food loss”, which is unintentional waste, often due to a lack of equipment, transport and infrastructure.
In rich countries, there are low levels of unintentional losses, but high levels of “food waste, ” which means that consumers throw away food because they have bought too much or by retailers who reject food because of strict aesthetic standards.
In developed countries, consumers and retailers waste between 30 and 40 per cent of all food purchases, while in poorer countries only between 5 and 16 per cent of food is disposed of. According to a 2011 report in Europe and North America, each person wasted 95 to 115 kg of edible food per year, while in sub-Saharan Africa and South and South-East Asia the equivalent waste was only 6 to 11 kg.
“In the developing world, food waste is virtually non-existent,” says Robert van Otterdijk, coordinator of the Save Food programme of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). “Food waste is happening in countries where people can afford to throw food away. One statistic is that the amount of food wasted by consumers in industrialized countries [222 million tons per year] is almost the same as the total net food production in sub-Saharan Africa [230 million tons]. But food losses, on the other hand, are really rampant in developing countries because of the underdeveloped conditions they have, from production management to transportation and distribution.”
The environmental impact of food loss and waste is high. The carbon footprint of food produced and not consumed is estimated at 3.3 gigatonnes of CO2, which means that, if food waste were a country, it would be classified as the third highest national emitter of greenhouse gases after the US. and China. About 1.4 billion hectares, or about 30% of the agricultural land available, is used to grow or grow food that is then wasted. And more surface and groundwater, or “blue water,” is used to produce wasted food around the world than for agriculture by any country, including India and China.
“The whole issue of climate change has to do with our economy of production and consumption being out of balance with what the Earth can provide,” says van Otterdijk. “Food production is one of the largest production sectors in the world and, if a third of all this occurs in vain, you can imagine the enormous impact this has on natural resources – on land, water, energy and greenhouse gas emissions.” The worst offenders are the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, where consumers waste 39% of all food purchased, followed by Europe, where about 31% of all food purchased by consumers is discarded. In the United Kingdom, 15 million tons of food are lost or wasted each year. British consumers throw 4.2 million tons of edible food each year. This means that 11.7 per cent of all purchased food is wasted in a avoidable manner, at an estimated cost to each family of £700 a year or nearly £60 a month.
The most common foods in British cubes are bread, vegetables, fruits, and milk. According to a national analysis of food waste in UK households, bread is the most wasted food in the UK by weight, and consumers throw 414,000 tons (22.4%) of all bread purchased. In percentage, the most wasted food is lettuce and leafy salads, of which consumers discard 38% (64,000 tons) of everything they buy.
The most wasted meat, both in percentage and weight, are poultry, of which 13% of all edible parts (not including bones) are wasted and the most wasted fruit in percentage is melon, with the equivalent of more than a quarter of each melon thrown into the trash.
The United Kingdom has made progress over the past ten years, following a concerted campaign to reduce waste. Van Otterdijk has pointed it out as “one of the greatest successes” in the fight against food waste. Between 2007 and 2012, the amount of avoidable food waste produced by households in the United Kingdom decreased by 21%, from 5.3 million tonnes to 4.2 million tonnes, largely due to increased awareness. Of the foods that are not eaten, less is ending up in the landfill. In 2000–01, only 14% of household waste was recycled or composted, but by 2011-2012, the amount of composted food had increased to 43%.
Van Otterdijk says there has been a “very encouraging, unexpected and continuous interest” in the issue of food waste, allowing popular campaigns around the world to gain momentum. “We have to do much more and need the involvement of the public and private sectors,” he says. “But if it continues like this, with the same momentum, maybe, after ten years, we will have significant results at the global level.”

"Scientists have created a “brain atlas” that reveals how the meanings of words are arranged in different regions of the organ. Like a colorful quilt placed on the bark, the atlas shows in rainbow colors how individual words and the concepts they transmit can be grouped into groups of white matter.
“Our goal was to build a giant atlas that shows how a specific aspect of language is represented in the brain, in this case semantics or the meanings of words,” said Jack Gallant, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley.
No region of the brain has a word or concept. A single brain stain is associated with a series of related words. And, each word illuminates many different brain points. Together they form networks that represent the meanings of every word we use: life and love, death and taxes, clouds, Florida and bra. They all turn on their own nets.
Described as a “tour de force” by a researcher who did not participate in the study, the atlas demonstrates how the modern image can transform our knowledge of how the brain performs some of its most important tasks. With new advances, technology could have a profound impact on medicine and other fields.
“It is possible that this approach can be used to decode information about the words a person is hearing, reading or even thinking about,” said Alexander Huth, the first author of the study. A potential use would be a language decoder that could allow people silenced by motor neuron disease or blocked syndrome to speak through a computer.
To create the atlas, scientists recorded people's brain activity while listening to stories read on The Moth Radio Hour, an American radio show. They then paired transcripts of stories with brain activity data to show how groups of related words triggered neural responses in between 50,000 and 80,000 pea-sized spots throughout the cerebral cortex.
Huth used stories from The Moth Radio Hour because they are short and convincing. The more captivating the stories, the more confident the scientists will be that the people who are scanned focus on the words and don't move away. Seven people heard two hours of stories each. Per person, that was equivalent to listening to about 25,000 words – and more than 3,000 different words – while they were on the scanner.
The atlas shows how related words and terms exercise the same regions of the brain. For example, on the left side of the brain, above the ear, is one of the tiny regions that represents the word “victim”. The same region responds to “dead”, “condemned”, “murdered” and “confessed”. On the right side of the brain, near the top of the head, is one of the brain spots activated by family terms: “wife”, “husband”, “children”, “parents”.
Each word is represented by more than one point because words tend to have several meanings. One part of the brain, for example, responds reliably to the word “top,” along with other words describing clothing. But the word “top” activates many other regions. One of them responds to numbers and measurements, another to buildings and places. Scientists have created an interactive website where the public can explore the atlas of the brain.
Surprisingly, the brain atlases were similar for all participants, suggesting that their brains organized the meanings of words in the same way. However, scientists only scanned five men and two women. They are all native English speakers and two are authors of the study published in Nature. It is quite possible that people from different backgrounds and cultures have different semantic brain atlases.
Armed with atlases, researchers can now build brain networks that represent very different concepts, from numbers to murder and religion. “The idea of murder is very much represented in the brain,” Gallant said.
Using the same data, the group has started working on new atlases that show how the brain contains information about other aspects of language, from phonemes to syntax. However, a brain atlas for the narrative structure has so far proved difficult to achieve. “Every time we come up with a set of narrative characteristics, they tell us that they are not the right set of narrative characteristics,” Gallant said.
Uri Hasson, a neuroscientist at Princeton University, praised the work. Unlike many studies that looked at brain activity when speaking an isolated word or phrase, Gallant's team had shed light on how the brain worked in a real world scenario, he said. The next step, he added, was to create a more complete and accurate semantic brain atlas. Ultimately, Hasson believes it will be possible to reconstruct the words a person is thinking about from his brain activity. The ethical implications are enormous. Another benign use would be brain activity used to assess whether political messages have been effectively communicated to the public. “There are so many implications and we’re barely touching the surface,” he said.
Lorraine Tyler, cognitive neuroscientist and director of the Cambridge University Center for Speech, Language and Brain, said the research was a “tour de force in its scope and methods.” But, the brain atlas in its present form does not grasp the fine differences in the meanings of words. “Although this research is pioneering in its scope, there is still much to learn about how semantics is represented in the brain.”

"James Hamblin, senior editor of the American magazine The Atlantic, recently joined the unwashed masses. As part of his series, ‘If Our Bodies Could Speak’, Hamblin, a relatively sane man, faced an unshowerful challenge to examine the effect of excessive body cleansing. He reduced the number of showers he had and removed the shampoo and soap when he did. In doing so, he discovered what thousands of other people have: the more fervently we try to clean ourselves with soaps, body washes and those silly little body polishers, the more difficult it is for our skin to work to restore balance, encouraging us to start the whole disconcerting process again. Shower strip the skin of its own oil and bacteria – what, many would say, is the point of showering – but, apparently, this sometimes works a little too well, especially when hot water and cleaning products are added to the mixture.
Do you know that feeling after a shower when you feel like you're stuck in a two-size suit too small? This is because much of the natural moisture of your skin has been washed down the drain. In addition, our skin, like our intestine, houses millions of beneficial bacteria. Showers destroy these happy bacterial colonies; they are completely erased by all our frequent rubbings and washings. And, when bacteria are washed by repopulating soap, they tend to favor germs that produce a smell – yes, showering too often can actually make you smell more. However, when you stop showering and using soap, the skin goes through an initial period of adjustment (probably gross), after which the skin normally restores balance, oil production decreases and healthy bacteria bloom.
After everything was said and done, Hamblin realized what other devotees without soap/shower have known for years: that the human body, functioning on its own, is really quite charming. It is not just aroma or aesthetic, either – although dermatologists suggest that slowing down soap use can improve acne and eczema.
Reducing the frequency of showers (and the number of cleaning products used) has very real implications for our environment. The average shower lasts seven minutes and uses 65 liters of water. There are 65 liters of clean drinking water that we are infused with soap and washing the drain every day, sometimes more than once.
The vital importance of clean water is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore, as California enters another drought summer. It is becoming clear that clean water is one of the most valuable raw materials in the world and will soon be scarce. Add on the environmental effect of all those body wash bottles and you have a handful of very convincing reasons to let your body go au naturel.
If all this is giving you the heebie-jeebies as you remember the last time you stood face to face with those who evidently already spare in the showers - and clearly have not reached the odorless stage yet - relax. Many cleaner-reducing enthusiasts still use deodorant if they deem it necessary (the natural smell of each varies in intensity and can be affected by a number of factors such as diet, hydration, and exercise) and hand washing with soap is still recommended as a vital way to reduce the spread of infectious diseases.
You do not need to go to cold turkey, as Hamblin did, but between three times a day disinfecting sessions and giving up showers completely there is room for our simple family advice. Reduce. Take a few showers, put down the soap and let those lovely little bacteria bloom a little bit, will you?

"Girl Scout doesn't seem to have a break.
Under fire in years past by including trans fats, high fructose corn syrup and palm oil in their cookies, the current season of sale of Girl Scouts cookies is under fire due to policies that have nothing to do with the actual composition of cookies.
A group calling themselves HonestGirlScouts.com has posted a video on YouTube calling for a boycott of Girl Scout cookies in response to a Colorado troop decision to allow a 7-year-old transgender child into their troop. Gay and transgender rights groups have reported a LGBT grassroots movement of supporters buying Girl Scout cookies in response to the video.
I have decided to buy as many boxes as my modest budget allows and donate them to the local LGBTQ community center, says Mara Morken, a lesbian mom staying home in Fargo, North Dakota. I want to show support for the GSUA in its honorable decision to allow all girls to participate in its programs. However, I don't want that support to show up on my thighs, so I'm going to donate the entire cookie order!
After an initial burst of publicity around the nearly 8-minute video with a teenage Girl Scout using a Girl Scout band, the video has become private on YouTube. However, it is still available for viewing in other parts of the Internet.
I ask all Girl Scouts to want a real girl experience that doesn't sell any Girl Scouts cookie until GSUSA -LRB- Girl Scouts of the USA -RRB- addresses our concerns, says the girl, identified as a teenager named Taylor, a member of the California troop, in some news reports. I ask all parents who want their daughters to be in a safe environment to tell their leaders why you won't let their daughters make more money for GSUSA.
The video was driven by the case of Bobby Montoya, whose mother told a CNN affiliate in October that a troop leader initially told her that Bobby could not join the troop because Bobby has parts of children, even though his son identifies as a girl.
The Colorado Girl Scouts blamed the initial decision to exclude the child from ignorance of Scout policy. State scouts said Bobby was welcome to join the Girl Scouts. If a girl identifies herself as a girl and the girl's family presents her as a girl, Girl Scouts of Colorado welcomes her as a Girl Scout, the Colorado Girl Scouts said, in a statement to a CNN affiliate.
The Honest Girl Scouts website says that Girl Scouts use cookie revenue to promote abortion and LGBT agendas, introduces Girl Scouts to the concept of sexual rights for children without parental consent, and is rewriting identification books to include radical activists and role models.
On its website, HonestGirlScouts.com states that the group is made up of current and previous Girl Scouts, leaders, parents, volunteers and lifelong members. When contacted through your Gmail account listed for comment, someone responded that the group's legal advisor has advised us not to comment or interview until further notice.
Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, rejected the video as an attempt by conservative activists to raise funds. This issue, however, Girl Scouts are a very good organization, says Keisling. It's been a really good place for kids to learn things. - LRB- This controversy - RRB- will die. We, as a society, are progressing and the old-fashioned reactionary attitude to which the poor girl was put in that video, those attitudes are dying out.
Other LGBT groups are taking a linguistic approach to the debate, encouraging people to eat more Girl Scout cookies. Girl Scout cookies may not be as good for your waist but they are great to be inclusive, says Liz Owen, spokeswoman for Lesbian and Gay Parents and Friends – LRB-P-FLAG-RRB. Owen reports hearing from people who decided to break their New Year's resolutions to go on a diet with a Girl Scout cookie purchase.

"North Korea is possibly facing its worst drought in 50 years, state media reported this week.
May is on track to be the driest since 1962, with rains of less than a quarter of an inch - LRB- 2-5 mm -RRB- registered in major cities, including the capital, Pyongyang, said Korea's Central News Agency.
Dry conditions are expected to continue in early June, reported North Korean newspaper Rodong, citing a state climate official.
Rain during the last 30 days has been less than normal in the north, according to Jang Hyun-sik with the South Korean Weather Administration.
On average, it is supposed to rain in the range of 70-90 mm - LRB- 2.75 to 3.5 inches -RRB- during this period, Jang said, noting that South Korean forecasters do not communicate directly with their counterparts in the north.
Rodong reported that the drought has delayed the planting of maize and has already damaged crops such as wheat, barley and potatoes, but said irrigation can fight the damage.
North Korea's food shortage is well documented. The World Food Programme says that more than 6 million people in the prison nation do not have enough to eat.
South Korean Ministry of Unification spokesman Kim Hyung-suk Seoul is open to allowing private organizations to provide humanitarian aid to the North.
Food aid from the United States is likely not to be forthcoming. Washington cancelled its food shipment plan after Pyongyang launched a rocket on April 13.
North Korea said the launch was going to put a satellite in orbit, but much of the international community saw it as a cover-up to test its ballistic missile technology.
The measure torpedoed an agreement reached in February under which Pyongyang agreed to suspend its nuclear activities in exchange for food aid shipments.

"Tigers are more numerous in Nepal than at any other time since the 1970s, a new census has revealed, giving conservationists the hope that large cats, whose number has been falling across South Asia for 100 years, can be saved.
The number of wild royal Bengal tigers in Nepal has increased to 198 – 63.6% in five years – the government survey showed.” This is very encouraging,” said Maheshwar Dhakal, an environmentalist from Nepal’s Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation.
The census is based on the examination of images of more than 500 cameras placed in five protected areas and three wildlife corridors. More than 250 conservationists and wildlife experts worked on the survey, which cost around £250,000.
Dhakal said a parallel survey was conducted in India and the results of both countries will be published later in 2013.” India will take a few more months, which now has 1,300 large cats in several huge protected areas, to complete the data,” he added.
Nepal is committed to doubling the tiger population by 2022, compared to 121 in 2009, when the last systematic tiger count took place. Increased prosperity in Asia has increased the prices of tiger fur and body parts used in traditional Chinese medicines. International gangs pay the poor local Nepali significant sums to kill cats. The skin and bones are delivered to the intermediaries, who easily pass through the porous border to India, where the main traders are located.
A major problem is the complicity between senior officials and mafia networks involved in trade. Conservation experts attribute increased numbers to effective monitoring of national parks, intensified efforts against poaching and better management of tiger habitats in Nepal, where forests cover 29 per cent of the land. But they say Nepal needs to do more to protect the habitat and animals in which tigers take advantage so that big cats have enough space to roam and eat.
As the number of tigers has increased over the years, so have incidents of conflict with villagers. Seven people died in tiger attacks around national parks in 2012, compared to four in 2011, park officials said. Villagers are also looking for better protection.” The government is making conservation plans for tigers. But it should also come with plans to protect people from tigers,” said Krishna Bhurtel, a local village chief in Chitwan, to the Nepali newspaper Nagarik.
Wildlife authorities captured a tiger in Chitwan after he killed two people, including a villager who was taken out of bed in May. Thousands of tigers roamed the forests of Bangladesh, India and Nepal. But its number has fallen to about 3,000, a 95% drop over a century. Chitwan National Park in central Nepal has the largest number of adult tigers, with 120, followed by Bardiya National Park (50) and Shukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve (17).
Diwakar Chapagain, who runs a unit of Nepal's Global Wildlife Fund that oversees wildlife trade, said tiger skins were in demand in Tibet, where people in heels wear them as party suits.
In Nepal, kings used to stand on tiger skins in front of stuffed tigers for special occasions. Some wealthy Nepalis have mounted tiger heads on the walls of their living rooms. Tiger bones are in great demand for use in traditional Chinese medicines.” Trade in tiger parts is lucrative and brings thousands of dollars into illegal markets,” Chapagain said, highlighting the threat faced by tigers.

"David and Melissa had been a happily married couple for six years. They lived a comfortably modest life in a small apartment and had been saving for years in preparation for the next giant step in their life: a baby. However, after repeatedly trying to get pregnant for a whole year, they consulted a doctor and received devastating news. Melissa couldn't conceive a child for the rest of her life.
The bad news hit Melissa terribly hard. Seeing his wife in such a distressed and depressed state broke David's heart. ""Don't worry,"" he said. ""I'm gonna make you the happiest woman on the planet, even if it's just the two of us."" Then he went to the bank, took out all his savings that had been held for the baby, and set out to do everything he could to encourage his wife.
Since they no longer had to be careful about the amount of money they spent, David began to strip everything he could think of. First, she took Melissa shopping for the best and most beautiful clothes she could dream of. Then, they took an exotic vacation to the Florida Keys, where they spent a month exploring each island and spending thousands of dollars on the most beautiful hotels, and most of the delicious foods they could find.
When they finally came home. Melissa said, ""Oh, David! Everything is perfect! I'm glad we don't have a child."" David smiled, contented with his wife’s happiness, and approached to check her voicemails from when they were away. The machine blushed and then his doctor's voice came saying, ""Hey, guys. Good news! There was an error in the test results. You're six weeks pregnant! They're triplets.""",B1
"The American Civil War took place from 1861 to 1865. The main cause was that the southern states feel that the U.S. federal government in Washington, D.C., should not have the power to tell them what to do. This was especially true on two issues, taxation and slavery. The economy of the South was based on agriculture, while the economy of the North was based on manufacturing. Southern crops such as cotton were sold to factories and then Southerners had to pay taxes on finished products sold to them again as clothing. Many Southerners felt this was unfair. Moreover, the agricultural economy of the south depended on the work of enslaved Africans and their descendants. Many people, especially from the North, felt that this was wrong and that slavery had to be abolished. Southerners felt that abolitionists threatened their way of life. Seven southern slave states, united, declared their secession and formed the Confederate States of America. The government in Washington, D.C., and its army were known as the Union, as they were fighting to keep the country together.

Abraham Lincoln was president of the United States during the Civil War. The President of the Confederate States was Jefferson Davis. The first battle was the Battle of Fort Sumter. During the war, President Lincoln issued the Proclamation of Emancipation, which declared the freedom of slaves in the Confederate States of America. This action was supposed to show that Lincoln was still in charge of all the United States.
The Civil War was the bloodiest war ever waged within the United States. 620,000 people died and millions more were injured. One of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War was the Battle of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania. 51,000 people on both sides died, more than in any other battle. The Civil War ended in 1865 when General Robert E. Lee of the Confederate Army surrendered.",B1
"The next time you decide to check your Facebook page to see if you have any new messages, like them, or just to see what your friends are doing, you can thank Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg is the man who changed the way people keep in touch. It literally changed the world.

Born in White Plains, New York, on May 14, 1984, Zuckerberg developed an interest in computer programming at an early age. When he was only 12, he had developed a messaging system that his father Edward used in his dental office. Zuckerberg had many friends who were artists, and they came and drew for Mark. Then he designed a computer game based on the characters drawn. In high school, Zuckerberg developed a music software program that attracted the interest of several large companies. He enrolled at Harvard University in 2002, where he developed his first social networking site for students only. The site was very popular, but it was closed by the school because it was inappropriate.
During his second year at Harvard, Zuckerberg began working on Facebook, a site that allowed its users to create a profile, share photos and communicate with other members. He left his second year to dedicate his work to his site. He moved his operation to Palo Alto, California. By the end of 2004, Facebook had more than 1,000,000 members.
Zuckerberg's rise to the top has not been without controversy. Some of his Harvard colleagues claimed he stole his ideas, and filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg. The case was resolved, but it remains a problem. Facebook generates more than $1.5 billion in net revenue today.",B1

Pleased to hear from you and how exciting you are coming!
You have chosen a large area to stay in as it is right next to a must-have attraction, Gardens next to the Bay. They light them at night and the children will love it. Another place to take the little ones is the zoo, and the night Safari is really worth doing. Animals are much more active at night than during the day, so it is quite special.
As for food, there is a great variety here. I recommend trying laksa and toasted kaya – both are typical Singapore meals. You can also eat well and cheaply in street markets. You should definitely check them out.
I can't wait to see them all!

"A wake is when people go to a deceased person's house or a funeral home to pay their last respects. A funeral home is a place where the preparation of the body for burial takes place. Part of the preparation can be to dress the deceased, make them up and place them in a coffin for people to see. Some people have a closed casket wake, where the dead person cannot be seen; some people are not even choosing coffins for their dear departed loved ones.

In the United States, more and more families choose not to have traditional stelae. There is a recent trend of people who have non-traditional stelae with the deceased inn doing something they loved to do when they were alive. For example, a family in New Orleans had their dead loved one sitting on a table with a cigarette between his fingers and a can of beer. A funeral home in Puerto Rico has become famous for its non-traditional wakes. It all started in 2008, when a family asked for their dead loved one to be leaning against the wall of their home for the wake. When a paramedic died, his family had his body in the seat of an ambulance driver. Another family had a man leaning on a fake boxing ring for their wake. A dead man was placed on top of his motorcycle. Recently, a grandmother was an inn sitting on her rocking chair.
However, these non-traditional wakes have their critics. Some people think they're disrespectful. They think of death as a solemn and sad occasion, not as a time to pose the dead as toys. Fans feel it helps them remember the dead as they were when they were alive.",B1
"Here's a way to make your iPhone hacker-proof: Ask hackers for advice.
I recently caught up with security investigators at the Infiltrate online security conference. At dinner one night, I put my iPhone on the table. He was surrounded by ethical hackers whose jobs are to find vulnerabilities to bad guys and exploit security flaws.
I could hack your phone easily, said security investigator Tomi Tuominen. Obviously, I noticed.
Over the next 20 minutes, Tuominen and information security researcher Robert Lee gave me a tutorial on how to make my iPhone hacker-proof. Some of them are basic -- like switching your password from four characters to something more complex. Others take a little more work, such as using the settings to limit ad tracking.

"T.J. Lane, a guiltless killer who escaped from an Ohio prison where he was serving three life sentences for a school shooting, has been captured.
For six long hours, police went through neighborhoods in the far north of Lima, Ohio, asking residents to close their doors and stay inside.
They brought in additional officers and provided patrols to the families of Lane's victims.
In the end, he was found 100 metres from a church, the prison director said. He didn't say anything, he didn't fight, the authorities said.
Lane was serving consecutive life imprisonment without parole for her attack at Chardon High School on 27 February 2012.
He went into the school cafeteria with a 22-caliber pistol and started shooting randomly. He fired 10 shots, killing three students.
The 19-year-old climbed a fence at Allen Oakwood Correctional Institution in Lima, about 90 miles northwest of Columbus, Warden Kevin Jones said.
I wasn't at the maximum security center. That's something we need to sit down and take a look.
Lane escaped, along with two other men, around 7:40 p.m. on Thursday.
He was back in custody shortly after 1:00 a.m. on Friday.
You never plan for someone to escape and certainly someone of that notoriety, you would think they would take special precautions to prevent this, Ian Friedman, who represented him at his trial, said late Thursday.
This was a huge case here in Ohio. So, everybody in Ohio is shocked right now.
Friends, the family remembers shooting victims in Ohio school
Prison violations
The Allen Oakwood Correctional Institution houses some 1,600 inmates guarded by 257 security officers.
A report by the Correctional Institutions Inspection Committee in April stated that the facility had an excessive capacity of 217 inmates. In addition, the number of attacks on staff by prisoners increased by 60.7% last year, compared to 2012. No leak is mentioned in the report.
In the 18 months she's been there, Lane was disciplined seven times, according to The Plain Dealer.
Infractions ranged from urination on a wall to tattooing, the newspaper said.
Lane escaped with Clifford E. Opperud, 45, who was serving a sentence for aggravated robbery, and another man. All three have been captured.
Chardon is 190 miles from Lima.
“We are upset about what happened,” Ron Parmetor said, whose 16-year-old nephew Daniel Parmetor was one of Lane’s victims.
Parmetor says he wants answers; how could Lane just escape?
The other two victims were Demetrio Hewlin, 16, and Russell King Jr., 17.
Chardon schools will be closed on Friday, but counselors and other support services will be provided, said the school district superintendent.
Agitated community
Chardon is a community of 5,100 people, about 30 miles east of Cleveland.
He was shaken by the high school shooting, and further traumatized by Lane's behavior in court.
Lane pleaded guilty last year on three counts of aggravated murder, two counts of attempted aggravated murder and weapons-related charges. But he never offered an explanation.
He was sentenced to consecutive sentences of life imprisonment without parole and to additional sentences for a total of 37 years.
At the sentencing hearing, Lane unbuttoned his blue shirt to reveal a white shirt in which he had scribbled the word KILLER on the front. He was wearing a similar shirt during his shooting.
Before the sentence, he addressed the families of the victims using profane images and ending the explote, F... all of you.
Then he lifted his middle finger.
For everyone in that room -- the victims, their families, the prosecutors, the defense -- everyone in that room was absolutely surprised, said Friedman, who hasn't spoken to Lane in a year. There was no way to fully understand what happened in the room that afternoon.
T.J. Lane squeezed the bar on the motive, escape.

"(1) Fairies today are the material of children's stories, few magical people with wings, often shining with light. Typically beautiful and feminine, like Tinkerbell in Peter Pan, they often use their magic to do small things and are primarily human friendly.
(2) We owe many of our modern ideas about the fairies to Shakespeare and the stories of the 18th and 19th centuries. Although we can see the origins of the fairies as far back as the Ancient Greeks, we can see similar creatures in many cultures. The earliest fairy creatures can be found in the Greek idea that trees and rivers had spirits called dryads and nymphs. Some people think that these creatures were originally the gods of earlier pagan religions worshiping nature. They were replaced by the Greek and Roman gods, and then later by the Christian God, and became smaller and less powerful figures as they lost importance.
(3) Another explanation suggests that the origin of fairies is a memory of real people, not spirits. Thus, for example, when tribes with metal weapons invaded lands where people only used stone weapons, some people escaped and hid in forests and caves. Another support for this idea is that it was thought that fairies were afraid of iron and could not touch it. Living outside society, hidden people probably stole food and attacked villages. This could explain why fairies were often described as playing with humans. Hundreds of years ago, people believed that fairies stole new babies and replaced them with a ""changer"" – a fairy baby – or that they took new mothers and made them feed fairy babies with their milk.
(4) Although most people no longer believe in fairies, only a hundred years ago some people were very willing to think that they might exist. In 1917, 16-year-old Elsie Wright took two photos of her cousin, Frances Griffiths, nine, sitting with fairies. Some photography experts thought they were fake, while others were not sure. But Arthur Conan Doyle, the writer of detective stories Sherlock Holmes, thought they were real. He published the original photos, and three others that the girls took for him, in a magazine called The Strand, in 1920. The girls only admitted that the photos were fake years later in 1983, created with pictures of dancers that Elsie copied from a book.",B1
"Once a child completes the fifth or sixth grade in primary school, they graduate and move to middle or secondary school. This school is a separate building or set of buildings. Most high school students are between 10 and 14 years old. The qualification system continues in middle school. High school usually begins with 6th or 7th grade and ends with 8th grade. Although less common, some primary schools range from kindergarten to eighth grade.

Most students are assigned a middle school based on where they live. However, there are public, private and specialized secondary schools that have an application process. The purpose of middle school is to provide a transition period between primary and secondary school. High school prepares students for life in high school. In middle school students don't stay in a classroom all day with a teacher. Students change classes for different subjects and have different teachers for each subject. In middle school some students may even be able to choose some of their own classes, called optional. There is a set of basic classes that all students have to take. These include classes in English, mathematics, science, and social studies or history. Gym classes or physical education are also required.
A common feature of middle school is a classroom, which is a scheduled time visit once a day or once a week. A home teacher takes the assistance and makes announcements of the things students need to know. The classroom also helps students feel that there is a common place and a common teacher they see regularly. This is to help transition from primary to secondary school. Once a student finishes middle school, they have a graduation ceremony and go to a high school assigned to them or a high school they chose.",B1
"Debbie Benzine lost her first husband to heart disease when she was 44. Her death left her alone to raise a little boy. For 16 years, she stayed single because, going through it once was enough for me.
When he met Dale Benzine, he weighed about 300 pounds, but he was in very good physical form. However, over time, she saw how the former football player began taking pills for her high cholesterol and high blood pressure, more for anxiety and gout, and insulin injections for her type 2 diabetes.
His circumference became larger, just like his neck, which caused sleep apnea, he remembers. After the couple in Atlanta got married, he found himself buying her ever bigger clothes.
When her insurance company announced that bariatric surgery, or weight loss surgery, would be covered by the couple's plan, she told her husband about it. I knew I had to do something, but I wasn't sure I was ready for something so drastic, he says.
It was.
The doctor told Benzine: Lose weight or die. I was tired of taking so many medicines and not having enough energy to just live my life.
One day... you find out you're 56 and if you want to see 66, you better do something about it, he says.
There are several types of bariatric surgery. With gastric bypass, a new stomach the size of a golf ball is created by cutting through the upper stomach and connecting the smaller bag with the intestines.
Another type consists of placing an adjustable band around the top of the stomach. The device may be tightened or loosened at subsequent doctor visits. It can help make patients feel more full faster and eat less. Unlike gastric bypass, adjustable gastric band procedures can be easily reversed.
Benzine decided to do gastric bypass surgery. Although doctors are not sure why, studies have shown that gastric bypass puts type 2 diabetes in remission in most obese patients. Dale didn't want to have the option of reversing the surgery either.
At the bottom of your mind you can always remove the band, says the procedure of the lap band. I didn't want to be able to come back.
Being approved for surgery was harder than I expected. Many people who have bariatric surgery gain weight again, so insurance companies are often cautious about paying for the procedure. Benzine saw her primary care doctor, a nutritionist, a cardiologist, a pulmonologist, a gastroenterologist, and a psychiatrist, all of whom had to sign.
The psychiatrist told Benzine that he rejected more than half of his patients because they were not prepared to make the necessary life changes after surgery. Benzine admitted that 10 years ago he wouldn't be ready either.
I'm from Wisconsin, he says. I enjoyed my beer, brats and cheese too much. But children and grandchildren change things. I was ready.
In time, he had the go-ahead. On the day of his surgery, his wife remembers that it was an emotional disaster. I tried to dissuade him -RRB - from having him. What if they made a wrong cut? What if he doesn't wake up? What if he had a heart attack on the table?
The surgery was a success, but it was far from the ideal patient. Shortly after the surgery he ate a paddle too fast and began to vomit. When he came home, he continued his trial and error period, getting sick as he learned his limits.
Imagine after eating your big Thanksgiving dinner... 10 times, he says he eats too much on his smaller stomach. And you can't do anything about it. You're so miserable and you have to go up or out.
He started off on a liquid diet, then I cleaned his food. Slowly introduced solids.
We didn't go to happy time or dinner with friends because I was uncomfortable, says Debbie Benzine. I started hiding to eat because I felt guilty.
It was like being a baby and learning to eat again, says Benzine. He realized that the meat -- steak, chicken, turkey -- was too hard to handle for his stomach. But popcorn fell easily. He developed 10 rules for himself, and other bariatric patients, and weight began to fall.
In six months, he had lost more than 125 pounds.
The hardest thing for him was to fill the time. He had to learn to reward himself with activities instead of food. Now smoke a cigarette instead of eating a bag of chips, or plan a big weekend getaway to celebrate a successful job. Order an appetizer instead of a plate when you go out to play cards with friends during the week.
Their daily diet consists routinely of Greek yogurt, protein bars, soup, popcorn, cheese, and cookies. He doesn't eat large meals, only smaller portions when he's hungry.
Somehow, his wife has had to alter her lifestyle to suit hers. It wasn't easy, says the couple, but it was worth it.
I'm 57 years old in 37, says Benzine with a laugh. No pun... I'm like a kid in a candy store. He plans to attend his 40th high school meeting in June with pride: I know I will be one of the only people who can say they weigh less at that meeting than at high school.
More importantly, I will have my husband and my best friend for a long time, says his wife.
Follow Dale's 10th Bariatric Surgery Commandments.
1 -RRB- Set your goals early, both in pounds to lose and the date you want to achieve this loss. Keep a daily record or scoring card of your weight loss.
2 -RRB- The trial and error of food and liquids will be necessary, but painful. Blueberries were terrible to me, but butterless popcorn worked. Imagine. Tip: Keep your anti-nausea pills close -- you will definitely need them at first.
3 -RRB- Find a breakfast with high protein content and a lunch you can live with every day. -LRB- Mine was Greek yogurt for breakfast and smoothies with strawberry, banana and chocolate protein. -RRB- Also, stay true to your vitamin regimen, especially vitamin B12, vitamin D, and calcium.
4 -RRB- Focus on changing your daily eating habits from three large meals a day, plus snacks, to five to six small meals.
5 -RRB - Stay hydrated! It is very important that you avoid dehydration, so avoid caffeine, carbonated soft drinks, beer and alcohol.
6 -RRB- Move more while you eat less. Start walking 30 minutes, four to five days a week. Build to walk farther and faster, and more often, while adding weight lift from two to three days per week. You will be surprised how quickly the weight will begin to fall once you enter this routine, plus your dog will love it even more than you!
7 -RRB- Start rewarding your new body with activities instead of food. Reward yourself by going to see a favorite artist if you reached a weight loss goal. Join a card club, start reading again, or make a movie appointment with your partner every week. Replacing your time going out to eat with activities will possibly be the best movement you will make throughout this journey.
8 -RRB - It's okay to leave food on your plate! Regardless of what your mother said as you grew up, children in Africa, India, or China will not be affected if you leave food on your plate when you eat at home or away from home. People will ask why, but trust me, you won't hurt their feelings if you say you're full.
9 -RRB- Ask for an appetizer as your main meal when eating outside. You will be surprised how full you will be after eating the smallest portions and your pocket will also thank you.
10 -RRB- And last but definitely no less important, welcome and embrace your support network, be it a wife, friend, business colleague, etc. You will have good morning and a few bad and unconditional love and support to these people will show you that it will help you push through the bad and be there to help celebrate the good!

"Most people do not know that the full name of the Statue of Liberty is ""The Statue of Liberty illuminating the world."" It is a symbol of freedom, especially for many immigrants. When many immigrants arrived in the United States at the end of 1800, Lady Liberty at the New York Port was a sign to tell them that they had arrived in the United States. Inside the base of the statue is a plaque with a famous poem written on it. The poem is ""The New Colossus"" by Emma Lazarus. Many immigrants feel that this poem tells them why they came to the United States. One line of the poem is: ""Give me your tired, your poor, your crowded masses longing for free breath."" Lady Liberty wasn't always green. She used to be copper, but the years have caused the copper that the statue is made to change color.

The 151-foot sculpture was a 100-year gift from France to the United States in 1886. It is located on Liberty Island just off the southern end of Manhattan, New York. The only way to get there is to take a ferry. Inside the base of the statue is a museum. To get to the crown, people have to climb 377 steps down a double spiral staircase from the feet of the statue. There's no elevator. People have to be in good shape to get to the top. People used to be able to climb the statue torch, but it was closed because it was too easy to fall.
About four million people visit the Statue of Liberty every year. People who can't go to New York can see replicas in Las Vegas and other parts of the world.",B1
"A Canadian man who emerged to fame after offering a free trip around the world to a woman with the same name as his ex-girlfriend has returned from the excursion with his chosen homonym, although, to the dismay of those following the story, love did not flourish among the couple. Jordan Axani, a 28-year-old Toronto real estate developer who became the founder of charity, returned to Canada with Elizabeth Quinn Gallagher, but said the couple had “forged a sister-sister relationship.”
Axani had made headlines in 2014 after offering a plane ticket to any Canadian named Elizabeth Gallagher. He had booked a three-week vacation with his ex-girlfriend but, after they split up, he could not change his name on the flights.
That's where Axani's new travel partner, a 23-year-old student from Cole Harbour, Nova Scotia, came in. Gallagher, named Quinn, responded to a post Reddit that Axani had presented – along with another hopeful Elizabeth Gallaghers – and was selected. Gallagher had made it clear before the trip that he had a ""very serious"" boyfriend, but that he had not stopped the romantics, and the journalists, from waiting for the globetrotters to fall in love with each other. Unfortunately, it wasn't.
“It wasn’t easy and it certainly wasn’t immediate. It took us about a week to meet each other,” Axani said. There was a certain amount of “natural escort” around “the two and not traveling together” as the couple came to know each other.
“I’m going to be explicitly clear,” Axani said, shortly after the pair returned to Toronto. “This was never a romantic effort. It was strictly platonic. I don't think of Quinn as a romantic light in the slightest. There's no future for us romantically. She's a good friend. I think of her as a little sister, but that'll be it. And his feelings are totally mutual in that sense.” However, it took work to establish that brother-sister relationship, good friend, non-future-for-us-romantically. Another one. “In the end, we had developed a really big rhythm of, a second, having very funny jokes inside, and, the next second, knowing when the other needed space.”
Although the couple did not fall in love with each other, Axani said the trip, which took place in Milan, Venice, Vienna, Prague, Khao Lak (in Thailand) and Hong Kong, was “fantastic.” A favorite place was Prague, said Axani, where “they had the largest pool of people that spread.”
“In the course of two and a half days, I think we met about two dozen people. So that’s a lot of stories, that’s a lot of individuals and that’s a lot of love for your hometown of Prague.”
People were following the couple on Twitter and Instagram, Axani said, and were even recognized on the street in Hong Kong. “It was a real adventure. We had a big explosion. We learned a lot about ourselves and about others. I don’t think I can imagine it going much better when I leave it than it did.”
Axani returned to Toronto at 3 a.m. on Monday, January 12, when the party stopped abruptly. He went directly to a board meeting with other board members in his charity, Un Ticket Forward. Axani began the non-profit organization after his post on Reddit went viral and intends to offer travel around the world to survivors of abuse, cancer and war.
Along with that, Axani is also in talks to turn his story into a TV or movie show, although he would not comment on the form that such productions could take. “Suffice it to say that there has been a significant interest from many producing companies. In terms of his love life, Axani said he was not yet looking for his next Elizabeth Gallagher. “I’m not looking for anything, per se, but life happens and we’ll see,” he said. “As always, life is a journey.”

"It was Laura's first Halloween in the United States. He had seen many portraits of the parties of late October on television and in the cinema. She had to admit she was a little excited and nervous about the day. She was excited to see the costumes worn by the children ringing the doorbell; she was also worried about being scared by the suits. I'd seen too many horror movies.

Laura was renting a room in a house. His landlady asked him if he could help with the candy. Laura happily agreed. The sun was starting to set when the first group of children in suits rang the bell. ""Trick or treat!"" They said enthusiastically when Laura opened the door. All the children had open bags. ""I want a gift!"" Laura said and took the candy from every bag. The landlady came running to the door. ""No, Laura. You give candy to the kids, you don't take it off,"" he explained gently. Fortunately, none of the children were upset. They seemed confused. The landlady suggested Laura go out with friends to a local community Halloween carnival. She took care of giving away the candy herself.
Laura went to her room to put on her witch suit. She walked to the local recreation center along with Joe and some other friends. The recreation center was decorated with fake webs and filled with artificial fog. ""We're going to lay eggs in some houses,"" Joe said. I didn't know throwing eggs was illegal. He thought it was another Halloween tradition.
A few hours later, the landlady opened the door and found Laura accompanied by the police. ""Trick or treat?"" Laura asked, looking embarrassed.

"Kobe Bryant is a professional basketball player who played his entire career with Los Angeles Lakers. He joined the team for the first time when he was a 17-year-old in 1996. During that time, Bryant led the Lakers to five National Basketball Association titles. The most recent championship was in 2010, when the Lakers defeated their arch rival, the Boston Celtics. The Lakers also won seven Western conference titles and eight Pacific Division titles during Bryant's time.

The Lakers are one of the most successful teams in the history of the NBA. They have appeared in 31 championship finals, more than any other league team. The team has won more regular season games than any other franchise. It is clearly one of the main organizations of the NBA, which was born in 1946.
Before Bryant, the Lakers already had some of the most notable superstars the league has ever known. Players like George Mikan, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul Jabbar and Magic Johnson. Bryant had been central to establishing and maintaining the legacy of this great team. He is the last, and possibly the greatest of all.
Your individual statistics are amazing. He is the youngest player to score 30,000 points. He has been selected for the NBA All Star team every year he has played, with the exception of his rookie season. He has won two Olympic gold medals in basketball, leading the 2008 U.S. Olympic titles in Beijing, and in the 2012 London matches. In 2006, Bryant became the second player in the game's history to score more than 80 points in a single game. Only Chamberlain has scored more. It has several individual Laker records, including most of the seasons played, most of the All Star selections, most of the points scored, and most of the playoff games played.",B1
"What does it mean to be innovative in business?
For a business to survive in today's world, it is important that we regularly review what we are doing and how we are doing it. By considering new ideas and ways to do things, and trying to innovate, we can improve our products/services, increase sales, reduce costs and make our processes more effective and efficient. Innovation is key to increasing profits.
There are several ways a company can be innovative with its products and services. Today we will see four of them.
1. Using the latest technology to improve your product/service
When we think about innovation, we often think about new technologies. Although they could be impressive, we should not use new technologies just because they are available. It is important to consider how technology can improve our product/service and make a difference to our customer. Companies producing cars, toiletries, household appliances, etc. They often have a large R & D department to work on improving their products.
2. Responding to customer demands by changing what is offered
By listening to customer feedback, we can get their opinions on how we are doing and find out what they want. We also need to be aware of changes in customer demands and keep up with the times. When McDonald's fast food restaurant realized that the market wanted healthier options, they introduced fruits and salads, while removing the ""super-size"" option from their menus.
3. Offer a new product/service to reach new customers
Your business might be going well, but there is no growth or development and there is a risk that your competitors might take some of your customers. Innovation sometimes means the development of a new product that targets a different market. Although video games were often played by children, in 2006, the gaming giant Nintendo introduced the Nintendo Wii game console, successfully targeting girls and older customers with games like Cooking Mama and Brain Training.
4. Changing the way you provide a service
When we examine changes in the customer's lifestyle and needs, we sometimes realize that there might be better ways to serve him. Customers who don't have much time might prefer to have their food or purchases delivered to their homes, or would like to make their banking online rather than in a real bank.
Not all innovation will bring success to our companies, but it can give us the opportunity to grow and learn more about what we do and what our customers might want.",B1
"-LRB-CNN-RRB- Over 22 months ago, Odin Lloyd's body was found in an industrial park in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. Lloyd had been shot seven times near a pile of construction waste.
The Boston Bandits semi-pro-pro-football player was 27 years old.
Days after being found dead, NFL star Aaron Hernandez was arrested and charged with murder. The testimony in the case against Hernández began in January.
On Wednesday, a jury from Fall River, Massachusetts -- after discussing 35 hours over the course of seven days -- found former New England patriots guilty of first-degree murder, which carries a life sentence without parole, as well as illegal possession of a firearm and illegal possession of ammunition.
Hernández also faces murder charges in a 2012 double homicide. He pleaded not guilty.
Just two years ago, it was one of the most promising extremes of the NFL, with an extension of the $40 million contract with the New England Patriots.
Friends and fans alike wondered: How could the star player who had more than 900 yards to receive in 2011 now be on trial for murder?
Long before Hernández made national headlines, he was a prominent athlete in Bristol, Connecticut, who came from a family described as a local sports dynasty.
I don't think there was another family more familiar in Bristol, Bob Montgomery, who covers high school sports for Bristol Press, told CNN.
The young Hernández was the golden boy, playing football, basketball and racing, following in the footsteps of his uncle, older brother and father, all well-known athletes in the community.
Hernandez's father constantly pushed his son, requiring him to practice for hours before he could go out with friends.
I saw a closeness with them that I had never seen before, Montgomery said of the relationship between Hernandez and his father.
But his father, the man who kept the 16-year-old boy anchored, died of complications after routine surgery.
Hernández left high school in the middle of his senior year in January 2007 to join the University of Florida Gators, and the problems seemed to continue.
In his first semester, according to a police report, Hernández fought in a restaurant off campus, beating the manager and breaking his eardrum.
The following fall, there was a shooting near a local club. Police reports linked Hernandez and several other football players from the University of Florida to a discussion in the parking lot.
Hernández was one of more than 20 people interviewed by the police, and he was the only one who did not make a statement after invoking his right to a lawyer.
At the time, Hernandez's mother told Orlando Sentinel newspaper, I know she was at the club, but she never saw any shooting.
The case is still open, and no one has been charged.
Hernández was also suspended at least once for marijuana, a topic that would follow him when he entered the draft of his first year.
In attempting to put the alleged use of drugs behind him, Hernández wrote a letter to the Patriots' chief of staff.
If you recruit me as a member of the New England Patriots, I will voluntarily undergo a fortnightly drug test during my rookie season... In addition, I will tie any guaranteed portion of my 2010 compensation to these drug tests and refund the team a proportional amount for any failed drug test, he wrote, according to the Boston Globe.
Before the draft, Hernández was expected to be a first or second round. He was overlooked until the fourth round, when the Patriots selected him.
At the end of his second season, he was a star in good faith, getting the contract extension of $40 million.
Less than a year after signing the deal, however, the Patriots left him the day he was charged with Lloyd's murder.
When Odin Lloyd stopped at a suburban black Chevrolet, Boston Bandits coach Mike Branch thought something was out of place. Lloyd didn't have a car.
Aaron Hernández case: Who is who?
Branch had his suspicions, but he couldn't get answers. Lloyd was too busy telling his friends about the good time he had at the club the night before.
He said he was at the club with Mr. Hernández, and they were partying and he had a good time, and that Mr. Hernández spent a good amount of money, Branch recalled. Lloyd said Hernandez spent about $10,000 that night.
Lloyd's friends say he wasn't a big partyer. He was more passionate about football and family.
Remembering Odin Lloyd
Lloyd was dating Shaneah Jenkins, the link between the young man who dreamed of the NFL and the American who did. Jenkins is Shayanna's younger sister, who is engaged to Hernandez and is the mother of her little girl.
On June 16, 2013, Lloyd was riding with friends in the Black suburban, which police later learned was rented by Hernandez.
Daryl Hodge was with Lloyd when he said Lloyd got a message from Hernandez, asking to hang out later that night. When they split up, Lloyd told Hodge he'd see him later.
The next day, Lloyd's body was found.
Prosecutors say Lloyd was last seen with the two associates of Hernández and Hernández, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, around 2:30 a.m. in a rented Nissan Altima silver.
The surveillance video of the security cameras in an industrial park showed an Altima heading towards an isolated area at 3:22 a.m.
At the same time, chilling text messages from Lloyd's phone were sent to her sister telling her she was with Nfl, adding, to let you know.
Between 3:23 and 3:27 a.m., nearby workers reported having heard gunshots. At 3:29, a camera showed an Altima entering Hernández's entrance, half a mile from the death scene.
Three people got out of the car, and Lloyd wasn't one of them.
Nine days later, Hernández was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and other weapons-related charges. He pleaded not guilty.
In April 2014, Ortiz and Wallace were also charged with the murder of Lloyd. They, too, declared themselves innocent. Prosecutors say the three men were going to be tried in a joint venture, a legal term that means it is not necessary to prove who pulled the trigger while there is evidence that each defendant actively participated in Lloyd's murder.
As Lloyd's death trial approached, lawyers began discussing evidence, including cell phones and text messages. Some sentences were victories for the defense.
The jury didn't see the message Lloyd sent to his sister, telling her he was with Nfl. The judge ruled it by telling rumors and said the state had not proven Lloyd believed his life was in danger.
The jurors also heard nothing about what happened in Boston on July 16, 2012, the night two men were killed in front of a club where Hernández had been. The judge agreed with the defense lawyers that it is too damaging and irrelevant for Lloyd's murder.
Investigators claim that Hernandez shot and killed Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado because one of the men met him on a dance floor in a nightclub and spilled his drink.
District Attorney Patrick Haggan described the scene in a Massachusetts court in May, saying that Hernández became angry and more and more agitated, particularly after Mr.Abreu smiled and did not apologize.
Prosecutors: Bump, spilled drink led to double homicide
Hernandez's friend tried to calm him down, and the two went out and finally entered a second club across the street, the prosecutor said. Court documents identify that friend as Alexander Bradley, who would continue to accuse Hernandez of shooting him in the eye in an incident that would take place seven months later.
After leaving the second night club, Hernández and his friend returned to their SUV and stopped on a nearby street where Hernández pulled a revolver out of the engine block, Hagan said.
Hernández began following Abreu, Furtado and three of his friends in his truck, authorities said.
He then approached the victims' car at a red light and bowed down the driver's side window with a loaded revolver, Haggan told the court.
Hernandez allegedly said, “I, what is now, followed by a racial insult, and fired at least five shots from a 38-caliber revolver,” Hagan said.
Abreu, the driver, was shot several times and fatally beaten in the chest. Furtado was sitting in the passenger's front seat and suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including one to the head, Hagan said.
Hernández was charged with the double homicide in May, and pleaded not guilty.
Investigators found evidence that they believe links him to the 2012 murders while investigating Lloyd's death.

"Katherine loved Facebook. With Facebook he could stay in touch with his family no matter how far away they were. He could see photographs of his cousins and read status updates of his aunts and uncles. With Facebook he could keep his relatives up to date about what he was doing. With a few taps on the keyboard and hitting the send button, she could tell a dozen or more people about her new job. I could also send pictures so they wouldn't worry that I didn't eat enough or wasn't healthy.

Another thing Katherine liked about Facebook was that she didn't have to think of time zones when updating the family. Every time he called his parents or other relatives, he always had to think about the time difference to not wake someone up or call when he knew they were in church. Facebook was very convenient.
Another thing happened when Katherine joined Facebook. Some people she went to high school with started adding her as a friend. At first, this didn't bother her. She loved learning about the success of people she knew when she was just a teenager. He loved to know that people got married, had babies and traveled.
However, Katherine soon compared herself to the people she was reading from on Facebook. It started to make her feel bad that some people seemed to be doing much better than she was. They had better jobs, nicer clothes, and nicer boyfriends. He also spent a lot of time on Facebook. It took a lot of time and energy to keep up with everyone's status updates.
Katherine started thinking. He looked at the list of over 500 friends he had on Facebook and realized that some of them were not really friends at all.",B1
"My New Year's resolutions
by Darren
I like to start every year with my New Year's resolutions. Then I read them next January 1st and saw how well I did.
Here are my resolutions this year.
1. Fit! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I say it every year, but I hope writing it in public will make it more real. I'm aiming at three races a week – I think I can do it! I think a fitness tracking app could help me make it. Or I could find a career partner. If someone reading this wants to be my partner, let me know!
2. Save 10% of my salary a month
Not having savings is starting to worry me and 10% is realistic. It's not too much, but it's not very little that I don't see it square. I'm going to put the money into a special bank account that will make it grow... Actually, I don't know much about that, so maybe my next resolution should be to figure out how to invest money! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3. Cooking more
I'd like to start inviting friends to dinner and cooking for them. I think once a month is a good plan. At the end of the year I want to have five dishes that I can cook very well so people will say, 'Have you ever eaten Darren's delicious cuisine?' Who wants to be my first guest?",B1
"For 13-year-old Arrianna Merritt, the words mother and hero go hand in hand.
Three years ago, Arrianna Sunday saw her mother Kim Dahl drive a school bus loaded with children across the Mississippi River when the bridge began to fasten from top to bottom. Thirteen people died in the collapse of the bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota. What Arrianna remembers most was the choice her mother made that day after the bus leaned upward on a steep slope.
Either you let us fall freely... or you hold that brake to the ground and you stay where you are. Dahl held the brake with his foot until he could reach the parking brake.
Millions of spectators saw the impressive images of the school bus as it staggered on the edge of a broken stretch of the road, with nothing but a railing separating it from a deadly fall. Arrianna sat on the bus with her brother, another 50 children and eight adults.
The bus went up, and then fell, Dahl recalls, adding that it soon became a free fall and she was holding on for her dear life. I thought this was it, I'm not going out, and I'm going to die.
The New 35W Bridge: Is America’s Safest?
With the parking brake on, Dahl kept the bus in place while everyone managed to exit through the rear emergency door safely. Arrianna, 10 years old at the time, and her brother David, 5 years old, were the last and had refused to go out with the others.
We didn't want to leave our mother, David, now 8, remember.
“I am like pulling your asses off the bus,” Dahl said. Eventually they did.
Dahl says he managed to free himself after a jolt on the bridge seemed to release his seat belt, which had been jammed.
Since that day, those on the bridge and their loved ones have never been the same. This particular mother-daughter couple says they have always had a close bond but Arrianna says she and her mother have come even closer since their test.
“We have always been close, but I believe that after the accident we approach because we share the same experience and know how it is,” Arrianna said.
The physical reminders of that day often overshadow the emotional ones.
It hurts to see my mother suffering because she can't do the things she liked to do.
Dahl broke it in the fall and that's been the main cause of complications ever since.
“It is like a new me I am living with,” Dahl said. I can't go shopping alone because I can't raise the milk and put it in the cart.
“My children and my husband... could not ask for a better family,” Dahl said. I mean, my kids stand up and do a lot of work that I can't do or help me do things that I can't do. They're pretty good at saying yes.
“I don’t know if life will ever be normal as before July 2007 and before, but we have done our best for it,” Dave Dahl said. We've adjusted our lives, we've changed our way of life. But we have to be positive.
Dave Dahl reminds himself that things could have been worse. Our family unit here in this house is five people, he says. In an instant it could have been two.
Arrianna in particular has taken on a number of tasks, such as cleaning the toilets and washing clothes, which she says has taught her to be an adult.
Most of the time when my mother is in the hospital or surgery, I have to intervene and be the surrogate mother of my younger siblings, Arrianna explains. The family also includes another daughter, Brianna, 11 years old.
And my dad's working a long time, so he doesn't have much time.
It teaches me how to grow a little and how to be an adult and how it is.
He adds that it can be difficult from time to time, but these days you simply remember who you are doing it for.
Now I understand why I have to stop and why sometimes I have to be the adult.
Kim Dahl also deals with post-traumatic stress, and still sees a therapist twice a month. And although Arrianna no longer has her own therapy sessions, she occasionally still struggles. Kim Dahl is among 122 victims and their families who have filed a lawsuit against URS Corp., an engineering and construction company contracted by Minnesota DOT to conduct engineering analysis on the bridge before it collapsed. A federal investigation report blamed the collapse of the support plates that were too thin, and increased the weight on the bridge of construction equipment. The amount of punitive damages the plaintiffs are looking for against URS is hard to say, said Dahl attorney Bill Harper, who estimated it could be as much as $100 million. URS was hired by the state to make sure the integrity of the bridge was safe for the public, Harper said on Wednesday. They didn't do what they promised to do -- and as a result -- that bridge collapsed. The URS lawyers said that the company's work was not related to the causes of the bridge collapse... the URS did not design the bridge, it was never asked to verify the original bridge design, and it did not know that the original bridge design was defective. Hennepin District Judge Deborah Hedlund is expected to decide on punitive damages in mid-October. Painful Reminders
On Tuesday Kim Dahl and Arrianna visited the site of the collapse, where the new I-35 West Bridge is located. The sound of a pneumatic hammer in the distance is enough to remind Arrianna of the construction noise that took place on the bridge at the time of the accident. It makes her cry.
Fortunately, Mom's close.
“He is like my counselor because he listens,” Arrianna said. She doesn't need a therapist anymore, but it's these rare times when mom's useful.
And from time to time, Arrianna says, her roles are reversed. Remember to listen to your mother sometimes say things about how life would be easier if none of this had happened.
Arrianna's advice?
You need to move on, and you need to be strong and live your life to the fullest.
Those are words that the family is living. Kim Dahl has had to give up what her husband Dave Dahl would call the wildest motorsports, and the five of them have taken a new hobby: road trips.
Kim Dahl says he'll never be able to drive a bus again... something he misses more than anything else. She had the same bus routes for years and knew the children and their parents well.
But the family camper can be the best. So far, they've reached Florida to the east and Colorado to the west.
My mother could never afford it... we never went anywhere, Kim Dahl remembers her childhood. And we went on -LSB- our -RSB- first trip and it was just awesome. Learning things and seeing things was just amazing.
As Dave Dahl describes it, there's no stress, no itinerary, nothing, just come on.
Wherever we get there is where we get there, he adds. We have a goal where we like to be at the end.
Given the path Kim Dahl and her loved ones have taken since 2007, that phrase could also be the family motto.

"Most individuals do not think of numbers, or numerical representations of quantity, but they play an important role in everyday life. To be sure, numbers determine how long individuals will wake up in the morning, how much money employees earn per hour, what day of the year it is, and much, much more.
In addition, the figures affect daily life on a much smaller scale. In the supermarket, for example, the numbers determine the prices of the products, the quantity of a product available for purchase, how much money will have to be paid for the products, and much more.
To understand larger (and more intimidating) numbers, interested people first need to understand basic numbers, or numbers from one to ten, as they comprise each and every advanced number, or a number of multiple digits indicating a larger quantity/quantity.
The basic numbers are as follows:
One (1)
Example: ""Buyed a watermelon at the supermarket.""
Two (2)
Example: ""Buyed two kinds of bread from the store.""
Three (3)
Example: ""He decided to buy three bags of onions when he went shopping.""
Four (4)
Example: ""In preparation for the party, Janice bought four boxes of ice cream from the store.""
Five (5)
Example: ""Joe collected five boxes of cereal from the breakfast corridor.""
Six (6)
Example: ""A pound of meat costs a lot of money in my favorite grocery store.""
Seven (7)
Example: ""Seven of the 10 corridors of my local supermarket contain pasta.""
Eight (8)
Example: ""I bought eight cookies for the price of four at the store.""
Nine (9)
Example: ""There were only nine breads left in the supermarket.""
Ten (10)
Example: ""Ten pineapples are many, don't you think?""
After ten, eleven (11), twelve (12), thirteen (13), fourteen (14), fifteen (15), sixteen (16), seventeen (17), eighteen (18), nineteen (19) and twenty (20) follow. These numbers are seen less in grocery stores, as most prices are $10 or less; however, it is worth knowing these numbers, in general and, in terms of grocery purchases, for when the account should be paid.
After twenty, numbers like twenty-five (25), fifty (50), seventy-five (75) and one hundred (100) follow. As long as one knows the core number, or the number located in the tens or hundreds position that determines the overall amount, understanding these more complicated numbers will not be difficult. For example thirty-three (33) is simply ""thirty"" plus three; sixty-seven is ""sixth"" plus seven; and sixty-nine is simply ""sixth"" plus nine.",B1
"Two tank barges loaded with light crude oil hit a bridge on the Mississippi River early Sunday morning.
The Coast Guard said it was trying to determine how many gallons could have been spilled in the river near Vicksburg, Mississippi.
The leaking tank contained 80,000 gallons of oil.
A Coast Guard team has stopped the source of the spill, the agency said in a press release.
The river is closed from kilometer 425 to 441.
No one was injured in the accident, which occurred at 1:30 a.m.
The Mississippi River in Vicksburg moves around 890,000 cubic feet of water per second, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. If the ship lost all its oil, that would be about 11,000 cubic feet.
In February 2012, a tank barge spilled 10,000 gallons of oil in the Mississippi after a collision near New Orleans. The coast guard drained the barge and towed it to a repair facility.

"Jenny's a fifth grader. She's considered one of the most popular girls in her class. She's very pretty, but that's not why she's considered popular. She is popular because she is known to be one of the brightest in her class. You can do the most flips in a row, but above all, you have the talent to dance.

Last year, he entered the school dance contest and won the first place. Her whole class was there to support her. Since that day, she has been the attraction of the class. This year, the school is holding another dance contest, but there has been a change in this year's competition. Competition has to be done in pairs.
Jenny's class admired her with high expectations that she would win again this year. On the other hand, Jenny wasn't sure about this year's result. She wanted to enter the competition, but she had never danced with a couple before. She decided to ask some of the boys in her class to come in with her. Everyone said no because they couldn't dance. Jenny was hesitating about joining.
He finally decided to turn to one of his closest friends, Carl. Jenny and Carl have known each other since the first grade. Carl was reluctant to join at first because he couldn't dance either. Jenny insisted. He finally agreed to join the competition. Jenny was happy and relieved. However, she was still worried because she knew that her class was counting on her to win this year's competition.",B1
"Manhattan is a small island that is a part of New York City. New York City, ""the Big Apple"", is actually composed of five sections called boroughs. These districts are Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island and the Bronx. Manhattan has most people in all districts, about 1.5 million, even though it is the smallest district by size. If you send a letter to someone living in Manhattan, don't write Manhattan on the envelope. You should write ""New York, New York,"" like Frank Sinatra's famous song.

Because the island is so small, most people live and work in tall buildings. Some of these buildings are called skyscrapers because they seem to be touching the sky. Some famous skyscrapers in Manhattan are Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, 70 Pine Street, Trump Building, GE Building and Citigroup Center. Manhattan is connected to the other districts by a series of bridges and tunnels. The most famous bridge can be the Brooklyn Bridge due to its brick arches. The New York City subway, a massive mass transportation system that mostly operates underground, also connects the island to the rest of the districts.
Manhattan, like the other districts, has many different neighborhoods, many of which bear the name of the ethnic communities that lived there for the first time. Some of these neighborhoods include Little Italy, Little Germany, Little Brazil, Chinatown and Koreatown. One of the most famous parts of Manhattan is Times Square. Times Square is called the crossroads of the world. Every year millions of people gather there on New Year's Eve to see an illuminated crystal ball. There are many theaters around Times Square. Most of these theaters are on Broadway, a famous street considered home to the American theatre industry. Another famous Manhattan street is Fifth Avenue. A part of the avenue features expensive designer shops such as Tiffany's. Fifth Avenue is also famous for its Museum Mile.",B1
"While many women are involved in planning their wedding showers, a baby shower usually comes as a complete surprise. A baby shower is a party where a pregnant woman is ""showed"" with gifts and good wishes. A baby shower is usually given by a close friend or relative of the future mother. Sometimes a pregnant person’s co-workers also throw a baby shower.

The baby shower is usually given when the future mother is between 6 and 9 months pregnant. However, sometimes, because predicting a baby's birth date is not always accurate, a baby shower can occur after the baby is born. A baby shower can be carried out in someone's house or outside, such as in a restaurant or catering room. Traditionally only women are invited to a baby shower. However, more and more baby showers also include the future parent. Like a wedding shower, a future mother will often register a wish list of things she wants in one or more stores. This list usually consists of things the mother wants for her baby, including clothes, diapers, and even furniture like high chairs and cots. This way friends and family can go to the store and buy something from the list. Registration helps make sure there are no repeated items, like 30 bottles when a new mother only needed 15.
Some baby showers also feature a paper mache that you want well. This isn't just for decoration. People can put cards inside with wishes for the new baby and mom. Most of these cards also contain money or gift cards to help the future mother buy anything else she needs for the baby. Sometimes there are games in a baby shower. In a game everyone guesses the date of birth of the baby. Another game has people taste of baby food and guess the taste

"It's a Sunday night in Bridgetown, Barbados.
Here on this Caribbean island, and in the others that make up what is known as the West Indies, life revolves around one thing: cricket.
Tonight, locals gather at the historic Kensington Oval, which hosted the 2007 World Cup final. There are no national teams on display this time, but there is a local trophy at stake.
It is enough to attract a large crowd of bustling fans. In the contest, a familiar face opens its way among the crowd.
This is Franklyn Stephenson, and he's the best he's ever played for the West Indies, all because of a decision he and his teammates made 30 years ago.
He left each of them, forever, marked as a rebel.
In 1983, the West Indies cricket team was on top of the world. Team captain Clive Lloyd of Guyana had led them to consecutive World Cup victories in 1975 and 79.
Contact Marked as a rebel presenter Don Riddell on Facebook
Abounding with talent, the islands of the West Indies could have run at least two teams of world-class players. But with all the hype and success, the money didn't go on. Playing international cricket and the club wasn't enough to make a living.
At the same time, in a distant world, South Africa was deep in the heart of apartheid. His government's policies had divided life into different classifications for whites and so-called non-whites.
Such oppression of the non-white population escalated into violence, arresting young protesters like Nelson Mandela in prison. Thousands more were arrested or killed.
As the world tries to put pressure on South African leadership, sanctions are applied and sport is no exception.
In 1970, the International Council of Cricket banned South Africa from competing internationally, leaving the country's cricket fans deprived of the sport they loved, and their cricket players from the races they dreamed of.
“You are always optimistic,” former South African cricket Clive Rice said. The stupidity that existed would change and South Africa would change much faster, and we would be back playing international sport. But he held on and held on.
"" Rebel tours ""
To save cricket in South Africa, sports managers knew something had to be done.
So, secretly, they started planning rebel tours, inviting several teams from around the world.
It was a bold move to challenge the ICC ban by offering lucrative contracts. In March 1982, England's first rebel team arrived in Johannesburg.
From our point of view, we knew we had the best cricket players in the world, said former president of the South African Union of Cricket, Joe Pamensky, one of the rebel organizers of the tour. We wanted to show them to the world so they could see it just like we did.
At the end of that year, a team from Sri Lanka followed.
And it wasn't long before many began to suspect that South Africa was also targeting a team from the West Indies, the dominant force in the world cricket.
You heard a lot of whispers around the place that maybe these guys were going to South Africa, recalled announcer Tony Cozier.
But at that time, we could not believe that they could assemble a team of West Indies players given the background of the anti-apartheid movement.
Many of the great stars of the West Indies were frank in their refusal to play in South Africa's apartheid.
Captain Clive Lloyd said that no amount of money could take him there. Future Captain Viv Richards called it bloody money.
But other players were tempted.
South Africa's offers were more than they would likely see in their lives -- estimated at between $100,000 and $150,000 per player.
It was enough to draw in names such as Lawrence Rowe and Alvin Kallicharran, fast bowling player Sylvester Clarke and wicketkeeper David Murray, one of the best in the game.
He also agreed to participate in the 1979 World Cup hero Collis King.
I made the decision because they were not treating me well as far as the West Indies - LRB- team -RRB- was concerned, King said. And I said to myself, well, cricket is my job. You're not gonna pick me, I'm gonna go play cricket somewhere where people see the right cricket. And that's why I went.
More than just cricket
The rising star Stephenson was only 23 years old in 1983, with a promising career in front of him. He had repeatedly rejected offers to play in South Africa.
But the day the team left, Stephenson changed his mind.
I knew the tour was more important than just being cricket, Stephenson said. I think cricket can make a difference, and I'm gonna be part of that team.
On the plane, Stephenson recalled, some of the players began to have doubts. But it was too late, they were on their way to South Africa, to face apartheid head on.
When we arrived in South Africa, I realized that separation, and it wasn't just black and white, he said. It's the language you speak in, the area you live in, and it's what you're allowed to do, and where you can go. So the divisions were very real when we got there.
The West Indies rebels prepared for their first test match.
But their concerns soon turned out to be unfounded... in crowds, crowds went out to see the famous cricket players.
“We packed them,” Murray said. We turned out to be 20,000 in Pretoria, the heart of apartheid.
As the tour continued, players began to believe something more important than cricket was taking place.
The young children -- the white ones -- asked for autographs. It seemed that South African fans could not have enough of the black cricket players in the West Indies.
For the first time, they were seeing blacks hitting whites, said journalist Al Gilkes, the only Caribbean journalist to go to South Africa.
Here was a country where no black man had seen a black person competing with a white person, and beating him. For me, that's where the real victory was.
`Destroyed as cricket players '
But the critics of the tour disagree. They say that the presence of a team of black men in South Africa did not help to end apartheid, but strengthened and supported it.
Even within the country itself, non-whites protested against the rebels of the West Indies.
In the Caribbean, the reaction was worse. A deep sense of betrayal crossed the Caribbean. Cricketers who were once seen as heroes were now seen as sellers.
When the month tour ended, the rebel players knew they would have to face the repercussions of their decision at home.
“I felt sorry for them,” Gilkes said, “because I knew they would never survive what they were returning.
The fate of his cricket careers fell on the West Indies Cricket Control Board.
Players were aware that they could face a ban -- after all, England's rebel team had been banned for three years; Sri Lanka's was banned for 25 years.
But they didn't expect to be banned for life.
Many of them were destroyed as cricket players, said Professor Hilary Beckles of the University of the West Indies. His cricket careers came to an end.
Murray, once a star, is now drifting, unable to keep a job in Barbados. In the years after the tour, he finally lost more than just his career.
His wife gave birth to her little daughter in Australia, while Murray played in South Africa.
They faced deportation from Australia for their role in rebel tours, and were also not welcome in the Caribbean. They had a newborn, and they had nowhere to go.
They didn't want me to come back, Murray said. Politics got into this.
When asked if his current situation was the result of his decision to leave, Murray replied: Most likely.
Mercenaries?
For Stephenson, the star that once emerged, his cricket past is behind him. He is now a golf instructor at a country club in Barbados.
But he still finds a way to connect with the sport he loved at the cricket and golf academy that began near his home.
There, a photo of his rebel team sits proudly on the shelf. It's not the memories of the tour that you want to forget, but what came next.
“No one took care of us,” Stephenson said.
For players, their lives defined by this unique moment in the history of sport, every day is a reminder of what they lost when going to South Africa.
But they also won something... strong ties forged on a tour condemned by the rest of their world, appreciated by the participants.
And to this day, they cling firmly to the belief that being in South Africa in 1983 made a difference in the dissolution of apartheid, less than a decade after West Indies players were there.
Gilkes wrote a seven-part series on the tour. In the last article, he stated that the trip could have started with players being seen as mercenaries, but he saw them as missionaries who turned white South Africans to accept that blacks were their equals.
“I know I went there as a missionary,” King said.
Murray agreed. I don't see the mercenary part of it or anything. We were just professional cricket players. You have work to do.
What do mercenaries do? Stephenson asked. They go and fight someone else's cause.
Well, yeah, I was a mercenary for the cause of blacks, because wherever I've been, I've been ambassador to my country, my race, and cricket game. So if that's being a mercenary, then it was.

"Improvements in Oak Hall
Introduction
This report aims to describe the problems at Oak Hall of Residence and discuss possible maintenance work to solve them. The two most important topics were discussed at a meeting held on May 12, attended by 165 of the 250 students living in the building.
Question 1: Room temperature
Several students complained that the bedrooms on the second floor were too hot. Concern was expressed about the lack of sleep and the difficulty of students to study in their rooms. It was suggested that air conditioning be a possible solution.
However, there is no budget left to install air conditioning this academic year. In addition, the facility can only be carried out during the holidays, as students cannot be present in the building while the work is being carried out.
Issue 2: Improved wheelchair access to the Oak Café
It was noted that wheelchair users can only access Oak Café from behind and not from the front entrance near the elevators. This makes it difficult for wheelchair users to access the cafeteria. The university is looking to improve its wheelchair access in general by installing ramps in key areas and the work can take place during the time period without problems for staff or students.
Conclusion and recommendations
Taking into account the above factors, August would be the best time for the installation of air conditioning. Until then, the university could consider supplying fans to every room on the second floor so that students can sleep and study comfortably.
The front of the cafeteria is recommended as an ideal place to install a wheelchair ramp. This work can be carried out immediately and must be a priority.",B1
"Add your comment below:
So great to read about the tradition of each of the most lost homes! I'm from England but I've been living in the United States for five years and what's weirdest is the Night of Fire on November 5.
The best thing about Bonfire Night is fireworks, and bonfires! ...and the story behind it. Basically, Guy Fawkes and his friends tried to blow up the Houses of Parliament and kill King James I. They almost did too – they hired a room under the House of Parliament and filled it with explosives. But someone told the royal palace. Authorities found Guy Fawkes in the room watching the explosives, and he was sentenced to torture and death.
So it's a tradition that celebrates the fact that the king survived. It also means that people don't forget what happens if you conspire against your country. There is a kind of poem about it that begins 'Remember, remember November 5, gunpowder, betrayal and conspiracy'. That's why we built a 'boy' – a real-sized Guy Fawkes model – and burned it at the stake. Too dark and awful when you think about it!",B1
"Andrea's acne got worse day by day. Not only did it not look good, but it made her feel self-conscious. I wanted to go see a dermatologist about her skin condition. Andrea had health insurance through her work. When enrolled in the health plan, he chose a primary care physician. That doctor would take care of Andrea's basic needs. However, the primary care physician was not a dermatologist. If Andrea wanted the health insurance to pay for the dermatologist, she first needed to make an appointment with her regular doctor. Otherwise, Andrea would have to pay out of her own pocket to see a dermatologist.

Andrea called her primary care provider. He had to wait a week for an appointment as his acne was not an emergency. When it was time for the appointment, she showed her doctor the acne problem. Her primary care doctor was able to prescribe a skin cream for Andrea. Andrea used that skin cream for a week, but her acne didn't get better. He called his doctor. The doctor couldn't do anything else for her. So the doctor gave him a reference to see a skin specialist, a dermatologist.
Andrea called the dermatologist, but had to wait another three weeks for an appointment. His acne had worsened during these three weeks. When he finally saw the dermatologist, he did a series of blood tests and allergy tests. The dermatologist told Andrea that acne was actually an allergic reaction to fried foods. Andrea thought it was a lot of trouble to finally figure out what was wrong. She was happy though now that she knew that all she had to do was not eat fried food, which was not good for her waist or her skin.",B1
"During the past week, I have been flooded with questions about swine flu, via Facebook, Twitter, CNN blogs and email. So this week I'm empowering people with information about swine flu: how to protect themselves, what all the numbers mean, and why you shouldn't be scared.
The most recent advice from the CDC is that non-essential travel to Mexico should be avoided.
1. Hasn't there been a swine flu for a while?
Yeah. The swine flu was first identified in 1930 when researchers isolated the virus in a pig. In 1976, more than 200 soldiers in Fort Dix, New Jersey, had swine flu. From 1976 to 2005, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention received approximately one or two annual reports from people with swine flu. Between December 2005 and January 2009, 12 cases of swine flu were reported.
2. The people who have it now, did they get it from pigs or people?
It seems that no one in the United States with swine flu had contact with pigs. Dr. Richard Besser, acting director of the CDC, said at a press conference on Friday that among the first seven cases, no one had contact with pigs. At another press conference on Monday, he added that investigators have sought to see if any of the infected people had contact with pigs, and we are not finding that link here.
3. The swine flu is transmitted from animals to humans. Does it happen a lot?
Yeah. More than 200 zoonotic diseases are transmitted from animals to humans, including diseases caused by bacteria, viruses and parasites. Rabies and the variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease - LRB- better known as mad cow disease -RRB- are two well-known examples.
4. Should I cancel my trip to Mexico?
Yeah, you should, unless it's essential. That's the advice of a recent CDC travel notice. See Elizabeth Cohen answer your questions
5. Should I be freaking out?
A new virus that spreads rapidly all over the world. Young and healthy people died in Mexico. Should we all be panicking?
Of course not, said Dr. William Schaffner, president of the preventive medicine department of the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. The swine flu, he said, is not spreading so quickly. Take St. Francis School in New York. There has been very little transmission from schoolchildren to family members, and it has certainly not spread through Queens. iReport.com: Share your thoughts, worries about swine flu
But, Schaffner added, this does not mean that we should not pay attention to swine flu. We must be alert, keep up with the information that comes out daily, and take control by being attentive to their hygiene. Wash your hands very, very often and avoid people who are coughing and sneezing.
6. How close do you have to be to a sick person to get swine flu?
You can acquire this infection if you are within the breathing area of a sick person, who is about three to six feet, Schaffner said. And we usually mean being so close to someone in a confined space. We're not talking about fleeting contact. We're not talking about walking past someone on the street. You need sustained contact. If you think you may have had contact with someone who is ill, read this guide to the CDC website.
7. Wow! Every day I'm so close to countless people... at work, on the bus, in church, in a movie theater. Could I have swine flu from them?
Yeah.
“If you’re next to someone on a bus, or sitting next to someone or in front of someone in a theater, you could acquire the infection that way,” Schaffner said. That's why people with the symptoms of any type of flu -- fever, diarrhea, body aches, vomiting, etc. -- they are urged to stay at home and away from groups of people.
8. Wasn't there a vaccine at the same time? Is there one now?
Yes, a swine flu vaccine was given to 45 million people in 1976. There is no vaccine now, although researchers are working on one.
The 1976 vaccine would not be useful anyway, according to Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
That was a completely different virus from the virus we are dealing with right now, completely different in the sense that genes are different, and it has no relationship, Fauci said. The designation of each was called swine flu, but from a viral point of view and the spread is very, very different.
Here are two scientific articles on the swine flu outbreak and vaccination program in 1976:
• Reflections on the 1976 swine flu vaccination programme
• Swine flu outbreak, Fort Dix, New Jersey, 1976
9. Many young and healthy people have become ill in the United States. Many of the dead in Mexico have been young and healthy. What's going on? We usually think that the flu affects the very young and the very old.
This happens sometimes with new viruses. For example, in 1918, when a new influenza virus emerged, many of those affected were young and healthy. One theory is that young people, who have strong immune systems, mount a particularly vigorous response to new viruses. But there is a potential side effect on the response: the body releases dangerous levels of signaling proteins, called cytokines, that can damage the lungs. Scientists believe that these cytokine storms can be fatal.
Here is a scientific article on the proposed mechanism of cytokine storms.
10. Why are there a large number of people dying in Mexico, but not in other countries?
This is the great mystery that doctors are trying to solve right now. Many experts in infectious diseases say it is very likely to be a matter of numbers: with more diseases in Mexico, there are also more deaths. Other explanations: that in Mexico people have, in addition to swine flu, other viruses that make a combination more deadly than swine flu alone. It is also possible that the virus that infects the rest of the world is a weaker version than Mexico. Among the mysteries of swine flu: Why only the deaths in Mexico?
11. Could this new swine flu virus have been manufactured by bioterrorists?
That's the theory of some conspiracy theorists websites. But experts don't believe it.
If you were a bioterrorist, you'd want to create something far more deadly than this, said Dr. Gerald Evans, associate professor of microbiology at Queen's University in Canada. The problem with the flu is that the second one that gets into people, replicates and mutates very quickly. Even if you created the perfect biological weapon, within a few generations of transmissions, I wouldn't do what you planned I would do.
12. I get flu shots every fall. Will that help me protect myself from swine flu?
The short answer is that the CDC says it is highly unlikely, Schaffner said. But he said it might be possible. I think it's a bit of an open question whether repeated influenza vaccines for years would provide a protective measure.
13. I was in Mexico two weeks ago. Could he have contracted swine flu, and the symptoms have not yet appeared?
No. The incubation period for swine flu is one to seven days.
“If you’ve just traveled to Mexico and you’re home and you’re feeling well, you should get on with your daily life and not worry about it,” Evans said.
14. Can the swine flu virus live on inanimate objects? If someone with swine flu touches a knob, then I touch it, could they have swine flu?
Flu viruses can live on inanimate surfaces. So theoretically, you could get swine flu by touching a knob that was touched by an infected person. However, that is quite unlikely, according to Dr. Arthur Reingold, head of epidemiology at the University of California School of Public Health, Berkeley.
Personally, I wouldn't have a big fear of environmental pollution, he said. Virtually all the flu is transmitted by sneezing and coughing.
Schaffner agrees, adding that flu viruses do not survive in large quantities on surfaces. A doorknob is not a warm and nutritious environment for a virus, he said.
15. What should I do if I have symptoms of swine flu?
Call your doctor... don't drive around here, Schaffner advised. Follow the instructions of your doctor. He may not want you in the waiting room spreading germs to others, he said.

"To the unaccustomed eyes, a man who takes 120 books while riding a stubborn ass looks nothing less than a circus show. But for hundreds of children in the rural villages of Colombia, Luis Soriano is far from being a clown. He is a man with the mission of saving rural children from illiteracy.
“There was a time when many people thought I was going crazy,” Soriano, a native of La Gloria, Colombia said. They'd scream, the carnival season is over... now I'm over that.
Soriano, 38, is a primary school teacher who spends his free time operating a bibleblioburro, a mobile donkey library that offers reading education to hundreds of children living in what he describes as abandoned regions in the Colombian state of Magdalena.
In -LSB- rural -RSB- regions, a child must walk or ride a donkey for up to 40 minutes to get to the nearest schools, Soriano said. Children have very few opportunities to go to high school... There are -LSB- few -RSB- teachers who would like to teach in the field.
You know a hero? Candidacies open for 2010 CNN Heroes
At the beginning of his 17-year-old teaching career, Soriano realized that some students had difficulty not only learning, but also completing their tasks. Most of the backward students lived in rural villages, where illiterate parents and lack of access to books prevented them from completing their studies.
To help bridge the learning gap, Soriano decided to personally bring books to the children.
I saw two unemployed donkeys at home and had the idea - LSB - to use them -RSB- in my library project because they can carry a heavy burden, Soriano said. I put the books on their backs on saddles and they became my work tools.
Every Wednesday at dusk and every Saturday at dawn, Soriano leaves his wife and three young children to travel to certain villages, up to four hours per journey, aboard a donkey called Alpha. A second donkey, Beto, is still behind, tying up additional books and a sitting blanket. They visit 15 villages on a rotating basis.
“It is not easy to travel through the valleys,” Soriano said. If you sit on a donkey for five or eight hours, you get really tired. It's a satisfaction to reach your destination.
In each village, about 40-50 young people await their opportunity to get help for homework, learn to read or listen to any variety of high stories, adventure stories and geography lessons that Soriano has prepared.
You can see that the children are excited when they see the biblehead coming this way. “It makes them happy to keep coming,” said Dairo Holguín, 34, whose two children participate in the program. For us, their program complements what children learn at school. The books they don't have access to... they're taken out of the bible.
More than 4,000 young people have benefited from Soriano's program since it began in 1990. Soriano says countless others have been helped, too; parents and other adult students often participate in the lessons.
Soriano has spent almost 4,000 hours riding his donkeys, and has not traveled unharmed. In July 2008, he broke his leg when he fell from one of the donkeys; in 2006, he was assaulted by bandits at a river junction and tied to a tree when they found out he had no money. Despite these wounds, which left him limping, Soriano has no intention of stopping.
In addition to the library program, he and his wife built Magdalena's largest free library next to her home. The library has 4,200 books, most of which are donated, some as far away as New York City. They also have a small community restaurant.
Soriano's hope is that people understand the power of reading and that communities can improve by exposing themselves to books and diverse ideas.
For us teachers, it is an educational triumph, and for parents -LSB - it is -RSB - a great satisfaction when a child learns to read. This is how a community changes and the child becomes a good citizen and a useful person, Soriano said. Literature is how we connect them to the world.

"For most people, an ideal morning might consist of waking up to the warm sun creeping through the bedroom window, along with the joyful singing of the birds of a nearby tree. Unfortunately, this is not the case with Michael, a part-time student who works at night as a warehouse manager. Michael arrives home at around 2:00 a.m. every night, and heads straight to bed to sleep as much as possible until his classes start at 10:00 a.m. However, over the past week, Michael has had a new ""alarm clock"" that he unfortunately has no control over. It is a energetic, noisy, nightingale who has decided to make the tree outside Miguel's window his new home.

Every morning, the bird begins to sing as loudly as possible at exactly 5:55 a.m. and does not stop until late at night. Most birds in the city start the day with sweet and soft chirps that can hardly be heard indoors, but the sounds of nightingale are very different and consist of several noises that the nightingale hears and then imitates. This may include chirps from other birds, or even car alarms and school bells.
After a week of losing sleep as a result of bird noises, Michael decided to do something. ""Go away!"" He screamed out the window. When that didn't work, he started throwing things into the tree to try to scare the bird. This just made the bird get even stronger! As a last resort, Michael phoned his local Animal Control, and asked someone to take the bird out of the area. ""We can't do that,"" the Animal Control Specialist replied. ""Ruffians are a valuable feature of North America's wildlife and are protected by many laws. You should consider yourself lucky to have one so close to home. Just enjoy the beautiful sounds of nature.""
Furious, Michael hung up the phone, and threw himself on the couch, sleeping in the deepest sleep he had experienced all week. Only five minutes later he woke up to a loud ""cow-cow!"" It's coming from outside.",B1
"Having your own space is a sign of success in the United States. However, renting an apartment is not easy. There are a number of steps you need to take. First, you have to figure out how much you can pay per month.

When you first move to a new place, most landlords expect you, the tenant, to pay a security deposit. A security deposit is an amount of money that you pay a landlord kind of insurance that you will not destroy your property while you are living there. Usually, the security deposit is equal to the amount of a month's rent. If when you move, the apartment is in the same condition as when you moved, the owner will return your security deposit. If the apartment has any damage, including holes in the walls because it hung posters, the owner can legally use that money to fix the apartment.
Once you know how much you can pay, you can start looking for apartments to rent. You can look in the newspaper or online. Also walk through a neighborhood where you want to live and be in search of signs of ""In Rent"".
There are two ways to rent an apartment. Most landlords rent apartments annually. This means that you will sign a document called a lease, which says you will stay on the property for a year and pay the rent on a monthly basis. If you decide that you want to break the lease, or leave before your year is over, there are usually fines you will have to pay. Another way to rent an apartment is from month to month. This means that you pay per month, and are not required to stay for more than one month at a time.",B1
"Cinco de Mayo, or May 5, is a party celebrated by Mexicans in the United States. Before 1776, much of the southern and western states, such as Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, Arizona and California, were part of Mexico. After the war between the United States and Mexico in the 1800s, these states became part of the United States, but there was still a very large Mexican population.

The Latino population is the largest ethnic group in the country. It represents 17 percent of the country's population, and 63 percent of those Latinos are of Mexican origin. Cinco de Mayo is a great celebration in the southwestern region of the country. It celebrates the Mexican victory at the Battle of Puebla, against France on May 5, 1862. Interestingly, the day is celebrated more in the United States than in Mexico itself.
In Los Angeles, the city celebrates the event with the Broadway Fiesta, which is the celebration of the world's largest Cinco de Mayo. More than half a million people come to downtown Los Angeles to participate in the 24 square block street fair. The celebration takes place on the last Sunday of April. There are rides, games, and especially food in this celebration and it is growing every year. Los Angeles is not the only city in Southland to host the May Five celebrations. The cities of Corona, West Los Angeles and Commerce also have events, and the famous Olvera Street celebration in downtown Los Angeles is also very popular.
One of the most unique events of the Cinco de Mayo takes place in the Hancock Park district of Los Angeles. It's called the May Single. This celebration is an annual charity event that began in 1999. It is a private party that benefits the homeless by providing shelter and support. Cinco de Mayo is a truly American celebration.",B1
"The chart shows sales revenue from a selection of video entertainment formats in the US. in 2017. It also shows the percentage variation from the previous year.
Online video streaming was the most popular format in 2017. US consumers spent $9.8 billion on services like Netflix, an increase of 32 per cent over the previous year. For the average American, this represented almost half of his spending on home video entertainment.
At the same time, customers moved away from the three physical formats of the chart. Sales of DVD and Blu-ray decreased by 14 per cent over the 12-month period to $4.5 billion in 2017, and rental income by duty station decreased by 20 per cent to $500 billion. DVD rental stores experienced the biggest decline, with spending falling by 21 per cent to just $400 billion.
Overall, there was a clear downward trend in spending on physical video formats, as all showed relatively low sales and all were in decline. However, there was an upward trend in streaming payment.

"A kidnapping suspect provided information that led to the discovery of the bodies of a missing woman from Ohio, her 10-year-old son and a family friend, authorities said on Thursday.
The remains of Tina Herrmann, 32, her 10-year-old son, Kody Maynard, and her friend Stephanie Sprang, 41, were found in garbage bags placed in the hollow of a tree, said the county sheriff of Knox, David Barber. Hearses left a wild area northwest of Fredericktown City in Knox County.
Herrmann's daughter, Sarah Maynard, 13, was found alive on Sunday morning on Mount Vernon, about 50 kilometers northeast of Columbus.
Matthew Hoffman, 30, who lives in the house where Sarah Maynard was found, provided the information that led to the discovery of the three bodies, Barber said. Hoffman is currently facing a kidnapping charge in the kidnapping of Sarah Maynard, Barber said.
Hoffman has experience as a tree cutter, the sheriff said.
“I have never experienced anything so great, so serious and so tragic,” Barber said, who announced the news at a sad press conference.
When asked if officials removed the death penalty from the table to receive information about the location of the bodies, Knox County Attorney John C. Thatcher replied that he could not tell whether Hoffman had confessed to the murders.
The county coroner will perform autopsies and provide information to prosecutors, officials said.
Thatcher said he's still not sure what charges will support the evidence, but he hopes to bring the case to the grand jury in four to six weeks.
A judge Tuesday established a $1 million bonus for Hoffman, who is accused of keeping Sarah tied and gagged in her basement, authorities said. The suspect has a preliminary hearing on 23 November on the kidnapping charge, authorities said.
A message that came out Thursday night with public defender Bruce Malek was not immediately returned.
Barber said earlier this week that the authorities were lucky enough to find Sarah, but said the blood tests found at Herrmann's house along with the amount of time the three have been missing had made the situation more serious.
The girl was at Herrmann's residence, but Barber didn't say if he saw the murders.
The bodies were found about 20 miles from the Herrmann house.
Sarah Maynard was found in a morning raid involving a SWAT team and was released from the hospital on Monday, after being evaluated and treated for injuries that were not considered life-threatening, the sheriff said.
Sarah's with the family and she's doing well. Barber said. She's a very brave girl, she said.
The disappearance of the three residents on 10 November led to a week-long search throughout the rural region. But, in the end, crucial information reached Hoffman, Barber said.
His information led to the location of the bodies, the sheriff said.
We're a small community here. “We became close to the families of the victims,” Barber said on Thursday. We have to take care of the survivors.
The police said Tuesday they didn't believe Hoffman was working with an accomplice. When asked if the incident was an invasion of home, Barber said it was not, but added that either they knew Hoffman or Hoffman made himself known to them.
Herrmann did not report to work at a Dairy Queen in Mount Vernon, downtown Ohio, on November 10, Barber told CNN subsidiary WBNS. An assistant went twice to his house in Howard, about nine miles east of Mount Vernon, and saw his truck there. No one answered the door, although the lights were on in the house.
A Dairy Queen manager went to the house on November 11 and found blood inside, Barber said to the station.
Asked about Hoffman's criminal record, Barber said he served a sentence for arson in another state.
Dawna Davis, who lives next to Hoffman, said she didn't trust him.
It was different. It was weird. He just climbed the trees and looked at us, she said about Hoffman.

They have the power to persuade people to buy things, and influencers are now seen by many companies as a direct way to the hearts of customers. Brands are now asking powerful influencers to market their products.

"Perhaps there is no greater mystery in the annals of American history than in the history of Amelia Earhart. Earhart's story is controversial and intriguing. She was a successful flyer, the first woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean alone. It did so for a time when women were not very respected in the United States. American women during the 1930s did not have the same advantages as men. There were few job opportunities. Educated women are a shortage. The women who found employment during this era were working as primary school teachers, nannies and maids for the most part. Amelia Earhart did a lot to change that perception.

Although Earhart was born into a family that did see financial success, that success was fleeting. There were times in his life when his family struggled to make ends meet because of poor money management. Earhart was educated at home for most of her life, and got her driver's license at an early age. In December 1920, Earhart's father took Amelia to an air show in Long Beach, California. This is where he first took an interest in flying. After obtaining his airman's license, he achieved a feat that only a few men had done: flying solo across the Atlantic. She gained national fame for this and was soon a family name.
Tragically, Earhart was lost in an attempt to fly around the world in 1937. They never found her. The theories about how he knew his end are innumerable. Many think he was a victim of the Japanese before the start of World War II. This thought was rooted in the idea that Earhart was a spy. Other extravagant theories include the kidnapping of aliens, but most likely he had mechanical difficulties flying over the Pacific Ocean. Earhart was killed instantly, or survived, according to a popular theory, and lived his days on a deserted island.",B1
"There was a time in the United States when blacks were not allowed to play baseball with white players. That was before the big Jackie Robinson broke what was called the color line at baseball. Prior to April 15, 1947, the Major Baseball Leagues were an exclusive ""white-only"" organization that prevented the participation of black players. Black Americans could only play in the Black Leagues that existed between about 1920 and 1948. Robinson, and the Brooklyn Dodgers, put an end to baseball segregation that year, and began a movement for racial equality in the United States.

Robinson was born in Cairo, Georgia on January 31, 1919, but grew up in Pasadena, California, near Los Angeles. He was a leading athlete who played baseball and football at Pasadena City College, then at the University of California in Los Angeles (UCLA). During his time with the Dodgers, the team won a championship, and appeared in the World Series six times. From 1949 to 1954, Robinson was named a member of the All-Star Team, and won the National League's Most Valuable Player Award. He was also named the New Year of Baseball in 1947, the first year he was awarded the award.
Today, Robinson is honored by every team in the National and American Leagues at Jackie Robinson Day. On that day, all MLB players wear the number 42 in honor of Robinson. That number, used by Robinson, was removed universally by all baseball teams, so it's the first time any league has withdrawn a number. No player on any MLB team can use that number again. Robinson was included in the Hall of Fame in 1962. He died on October 24, 1972, and was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal for his part in changing American society.",B1
"It was the morning after Julia's first Thanksgiving in the United States. The night before, she had a big dinner with her friend Elizabeth's family. Before eating roasted turkey, sweet potatoes and cranberry sauce, each person at the table had to say something for which they were grateful. Julia appreciated having been able to participate in this feast that recalls the first harvest of pilgrims after arriving from England a long time ago.

Julia's phone rang at 4:00 in the morning. It was Elizabeth. Elizabeth invited Julia to go shopping with her. ""Let's go to the stores so early?"" Julia asked sleepily. Elizabeth explained that the day after Thanksgiving in the United States was called Black Friday. The stores, which had special sales, started very early. ""It's the official start of the Christmas shopping season,"" Elizabeth explained.
Julia and Elizabeth were outside the local mall at 5:00 in the morning. Julia was surprised to see that not only were all the shops open, but they were full of people. Elizabeth told Julia this was nothing. Some people camped out of the mall all night so they could be among the first to enter and get extra special offers called ""door robbers."" Many times these ""door ruiners"" were electronic items at extremely low prices. Often only a small number of these items are available. Sometimes they are only available for the first 100 people online.
Julia thought it sounded violent and wondered aloud if people really broke the doors to enter the store. ""Sometimes there's a lot of push,"" Elizabeth explained. Some people have even been injured, or killed, due to physical fights over limited products. However, at 5 a.m., the porters were gone and the cash registers had long queues. Many buyers had shopping carts full of gifts they intended to give away for Christmas, Hanukkah, or Kwanzaa.",B1
"There aren't enough exercise classes to have tea halfway. But Margaret Allen does. After a mild warm-up and a few pulse numbers, the 93-year-old great-grandmother lets her loads moisturize with a cup of tea and a quick sitting.
Some of class eight-strong look like they need it more than others. Allen himself, wearing a thick turquoise shirt, sea-dot vest, black pants and sensitive shoes, has not broken into a sweat. Despite an “incrusting” nerve trapped in a leg and knee that need to be replaced, it seems that it could continue for hours.
The general rule is that eating directly before the sport is not the best idea, let alone a part. But in the afternoon I visit Allen's class in a church hall in Saltburn-by-the-Sea near Middlesbrough, slices of fruit cake are being passed around during the break. The cake has been baked in honor of Allen’s recent birthday by her 89-year-old sister, Joan, known locally as the “Queen of the Saltburn Scones.”
The ladies have barely swallowed their last crumb when Allen gets up again, leading the group through a Scottish number full of aim and kicks in the legs. Forty-five minutes later, the class is finally over.
Allen, a former Red Cross volunteer, has been running classes in the northeastern coastal city for 45 years. Not especially sporty at school, he began playing the piano for an adjustment class during World War II – “just to do something during the blackouts, really” – and finally took over in his 40 years when the previous instructor retired. At its peak, Allen's class had more than 18 regulars, each paying £1 at a time. But, these days, her flock is rapidly decreasing – during the tea break, the ladies discuss a funeral that most of them had attended that week for one of the younger members of the group who had just died, at 68 years of age, from motor neuron disease.
Allen is the oldest, followed by his sister. The group's baby is Jean Cunion, 60, who attributes support to the group during a difficult time when his mother died. She's a little embarrassed to admit she's perhaps the least fit in the group. “I remember, the first time I came, Margaret said, ‘Who is that gasping and gasping?’ And I had to admit it was me.” Ruth Steere, 76, marvels that Allen never misses a trick, despite always having her back in class: “He always yells at us if we get it wrong. She’s extraordinarily good at knowing what we’re doing.”
Allen, an enthusiastic dancer, has never done any formal training to be a fitness instructor. Instead, he choreographs his own movements based on five tapes of the BBC's first fitness guru, Eileen Fowler, who died in 2000 when he was 93, Allen's age now. Allen believes that her good health is largely due to keeping busy, especially since her husband Joe died in 1997. He dedicated himself to writing poetry when he was 80 years old.
“I write poems about everything. I'm a prolific writer. I just can’t stop,” he says, calling me a few days after the interview to read a story he has written about the joys of exercise. One of the classes, former teacher Winnie Robertson, 84, thinks the secret to keeping fit is never letting you go: “Use or lose, that’s what I say.”
Allen still plays the piano and gives speeches. She is president of the Women's Church at the local Methodist Church and is one of three young women over 90 years of age at the Scrabble Club of the University of the Third Age. He took a computer course when he was 88 and tried to get online, but it didn't work.
Aging is not fun, he admits, reading me some lines from a poem he has written called 'That Beast called Age'. She happily recalls a doctor who first saw her a few years ago, who said she couldn’t be more than 78 years old: “I said, ‘Thank you, doctor. You can go now. '""
He also has a senseless attitude toward weight gain: “I just don’t think people should eat too much. Every time I hear someone say, 'Oh, I can't lose weight,' I say, 'Sellotape. ""She covers her mouth with cuddle. “I told this to a fat man the other day. Everything in moderation is my motto.”
In early 2013, Allen was watching the news and saw a woman receiving the British Empire Medal. I think it refers to Margaret Chartwood of Horley, who was granted honor in January, at the age of 77. “She was saying, ‘I’m 80 years old and I’m the oldest fitness instructor in the country!’ I was thinking, 'No, you're not.' But I will not write to Buckingham Palace.”

"What about Christmas music that enters our souls, calms us down and even makes us do things that are right for humanity? This music even has the ability to make us like our old aunt Emily. If there was a marketing campaign for Christmas, it would be the most successful campaign ever conceived.
Paintings of angels protecting sheep or a masterful interpretation of the manger scene certainly evoke emotion. Then there's a good Christmas story. In 1843, Charles Dickens gave us a Christmas Carol. This literary gift had the power to make us give a couple of things to those in need.
However, it is music and song that has no rival in the ability to stir raw emotions. No matter what your religious persuasion is. Most people can recite and hum the Christmas carols they have heard repeatedly since childhood.
Among the most familiar are the pop songs: Santa Claus is Coming To Town, which the four stations, Bruce Springsteen and Bing Crosby all performed; Gene Autry's Here Comes Santa Claus ; Elvis Presley's Blue Christmas ; and Brenda Lee's RockinAround the Christmas Tree.
Then there's one that the vendors made sure that it really goes through the heart -- I'll be home for Christmas -- and the line, if only in my dreams. I forgot how lonely and depressed I was until I heard that song. The home of the notion of Christmas originates during World War I, when American soldiers expected a quick victory, thinking they would be back in the United States in time for the holidays. That was not the case, and the song was a great success decades later -- in 1943. Speaking of hits, there are White Christmas -- over 500 different recordings were made of this song; it was originally written for the movie Holiday Inn.
These songs evoke old family photos of relatives here and long gone. We said, oh, look, here's an old kind of Aunt Emily... she was so kind and generous. Even if we never liked it... but then it's Christmas. - RRB-
Below are the seasonal songs that really have little or nothing to do with vacations. Once again, those vendors have perfected their skills to pull our sentimental strings. Dean Martin singing Let It Snow! Leave it snow! Leave it snow! Dinah Shore and Buddy Clark making Baby, it's cold outside. -LRB- This song of trying to lure a young woman to stay was written for the film Daughter of Neptune, with Esther Williams and Ricardo Montalban. - RRB-
Judy Garland singing Have Youself A Merry Little Christmas in the 1944 movie Meet Me In St. Louis and dozens more all have great images, and they are all seasonal. Did you know that Jingle Bells was originally titled One Horse Open Sleigh and was written in late 1850 by James Pierpont, to be performed during a Thanksgiving service at his Unitary Church in Savannah, Georgia? The congregation enjoyed it so much that it was repeated during Christmas services, and Jingle Bells left there.
Of course, Christmas is for children. There are new songs written for children, such as the most famous reindeer of all, Rudolph. He entered our lives when we were young with his bright red nose and never came out of the roof. Then there's all I want from Jimmy Boyd for Christmas are my two front teeth, the version of the singing dogs of Jingle Bells and Homer and Jethro's grandmother was run over by a reindeer. Songs that only a child can like.
But my favorite has to be Dominic de Lou Monte the Italian Christmas Donkey. What if I want a hippo for Christmas, Gayla Peevey? Someone please explain why someone would buy that song.
So here's the question: What's all this about? The emotional and often wonderful snapshots of our lives, past and present, all wrapped up for Christmas. Have we been tricked into loving this holiday? Of course not.
A while ago I realized we all need a little Christmas. The security of home, family and friends is essential.
So this marketing campaign that started with our first steps is okay, we need it. Is there a Santa Claus? Have I been a good boy? Or, as Nat King Cole popularly asked: Do reindeer really know how to fly? Yes, of course, to all those questions. Wouldn't it have been nice if those marketing guys had figured out a way to make those 12 days of Christmas last the other 353 days of the year?
So cover the halls and please stop leaving Santa those chip fattening chocolate cookies -- he's gained a lot of weight over the last 200 years. And I say to you, Fa la la la la, la la la la.
Happy holidays, cousins.

"Many cried. Some prayed. But after their smoke-filled plane shuddered toward an emergency landing, the passengers had a new life contract, as they left a JetBlue flight on Thursday through inflatable parachutes.
“I am happy to be alive,” passenger Jarrod West said, who slipped by holding his black Chihuahua. I don't think she'll be mean to anyone again.
Four people were injured in the incident; one was taken to the hospital, reported CNN affiliate KCAL.
A strong explosion started the disaster, said West and other passengers who spoke to KCAL from Long Beach Airport, California.
Flight 1416 had left Long Beach Airport about 15 minutes earlier and was over the ocean, carrying 147 passengers and crew to Austin, Texas.
Then the right engine exploded, JetBlue told KCAL.
A signal alerted the pilots that an engine was overheating, fire department spokesman Jake Heflin told KCAL. Pilots deployed fire extinguishers.
Smoke-filled cabin
Actor Jackson Rathbone was on the flight with his wife and son. Our right engine exploded and our cabin filled with smoke, posted on Twitter.
It became so thick that passengers could no longer see people sitting next to them, Jonathon Hubbard said.
West realized that it would soon be hard for him to breathe, but the oxygen masks did not fall, he said.
So the stewardesses went around handing them out.
Fortunately, not far from his departure airport, the plane made a sharp turn towards him, Rathbone said. The actor is known for his role as Jasper Hale in the Twilight series and stars in the television series Aim High.
Tears like airplane rattles
As he flew over the ground, the plane began to tremble, and the passengers broke into tears, fearful of their lives.
“Everyone was crying,” passenger Dean Delbaugh said. I thought this was it. His wife, sitting next to him, held on to him.
Rathbone was also flying with his family.
I recited the Lord's prayer while holding my son and my wife in my arms, he posted on the social networks they said.
Then the attendants prepared the passengers in case of a hard landing.
The stewardesses shouted, shouted and repeated it and repeated it in the upper part of their lungs, West said.
Happy to be alive
But the pilot ended the scare by putting the plane, which FlightAware.com identified as an Airbus A320, gently on the track.
He put it in the numbers. He did well, West said. He came later and said hello to everyone. We all hugged him and thanked him.
Passenger Jonathan Hubbard was sitting in the departure line and he didn't waste any time.
I took the exit door and threw it off the plane and jumped, told KCAL. An inflatable parachute was waiting to catch him.
JetBlue spokesman Jessica Felipe said everyone evacuated the plane using emergency slides.
I grabbed my son and jumped down the inflated ramp, my wife following, Rathbone tweeted. We leave all our personal effects on board. Who cares. We were alive.
The passengers were taken to a room, where they were interrogated, Rathbone said. KCAL reported that those who wished to continue to Austin were put on a later flight.
There was no statement about the incident of Flight 1416 on the JetBlue website. But on the day of the incident, the airline announced that CEO Dave Barger would retire, starting in February. The statement did not link the decision to the setback.
In August, a JetBlue engine caught fire in San Juan, Puerto Rico, sending passengers and crew on emergency slides.
Rathbone and her family went home to celebrate her life during Thursday's scare with a wine and champagne tasting, she said about who she said -- opened a half dozen bottles.
Steve Almasy of CNN contributed to this report.

"Millie's sister, Arlene, had been fighting breast cancer for five years. Then the doctor gave Arlene bad news. The cancer had spread to her brain and there was no treatment to cure her. ""I'll keep taking care of you,"" Millie told her sister. Millie and Arlene were 50, but Millie was five years older than Arlene. Arlene would always be Millie's little sister. Throughout Arlene's disease, Millie took care of things. Millie went with Arlene to all her dates. Millie went to all Arlene's chemotherapy and radiation treatments. When Arlene lost her hair to chemo, Millie helped her pick a natural-looking wig. Arlene was grateful, but she also felt bad. Millie had a family of her own to take care of, and yet she spent most of her time taking care of Arlene.

Arlene told Millie that she wanted to be put in a hospice. Millie didn't know what it was. Arlene's doctor gave the sisters some brochures. The brochures explained that hospice care would try to make Arlene feel as comfortable as possible by treating pain. They also focused on the emotional health of patients and their families through counselling. Millie was reluctant to put Arlene in the hospice. Millie felt like she was abandoning her little sister. But Arlene insisted.
""It's about time someone else waited for me by the hand and foot,"" Arlene joked. Millie went with Arlene to check in at the hospice. The staff not only took care of Arlene, but also carried out activities for Millie, a member of the family. The staff told Millie that she could spend the night here whenever she wanted. Arlene was asked what were some of her favorite meals so her chef could do what she liked. Arlene felt comfortable in the hospice.",B1
"The president he once pointed a gun at has been dead for almost three years, and her idol and long-time leader, Charles Manson, is still in prison.
Lynnette Squeaky Fromme appeared in court in Los Angeles, California, in December 1969.
However, Lynette Squeaky Fromme is about to get her first taste of real freedom in more than three decades.
According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Fromme, now 60 years old, will be released on parole on August 16.
Fromme is located at the Carswell Federal Medical Center in Fort Worth, Texas.
For years, he was one of Manson's few remaining followers, as many other members of the Manson family have rejected him. A spokesman for the prison wouldn't say if Fromme still corresponded to Manson.
Fromme was convicted in 1975 for pointing a gun at then President Gerald Ford in Sacramento, California. Secret Service agents prevented him from firing, but it was later discovered that the weapon had no bullet in the camera, although it contained a loader of ammunition.
In a 1987 interview with CNN WCHS affiliate Fromme, then housed in West Virginia, recalled that the president had his hands out and was waving... and I thought it was cardboard. But at the same time, I had expelled the bullet in my apartment and used the gun as it was.
He said he knew Ford was in town and near her, and I said, I have to go and talk to him, and then I thought, that's silly. They're not going to stop talking to you.People have already shown that you can put blood in front of them and they're not, you know, they don't think about it. I said, maybe I'll take the gun, and I thought, I have to do this. This is the time.
He said it never occurred to him that he could end up in prison. Asked if he had any regrets, Fromme said, No. No, I don't. I feel like it was fate. However, he said that he thought his imprisonment was unnecessary and that he could not see himself repeating his offense.
My argument before the jury was that, if I wanted to kill him, I would have shot him, John Virga, a Sacramento lawyer appointed to defend Fromme, told CNN on Tuesday. I'd been near the guns. And let's be realistic: we know that the Manson family, at least some of them, are murderers.
Fromme was sentenced to life imprisonment, but parole was an option at the time, although the federal system later abolished it, said Felicia Ponce, spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons. The prisoners receive good weather, because every year and one day they serve, Ponce said, 54 days their sentence is taken away.
Fromme became eligible for parole in 1985, Ponce said. Reportedly, for years he waived his right to a parole hearing. The Bureau of Prisons would not say if he changed his mind and requested a hearing, but the website of the United States Probation Commission says that all those who wish to be considered for parole, except those committed under juvenile delinquency proceedings, must complete a parole application.
Federal prisoners serving life imprisonment are generally released on parole after 30 years, unless the parole commission decides to block release, according to a spokesperson for the commission. Probation prisoners remain under supervision until the commission decides to terminate the sentence.
Fromme did not get parole until July 2008, Ponce said. She was not released then, however, due to the additional time added to her sentence for a 1987 escape from West Virginia prison, which occurred after her interview that same year. She was found two days later, a few kilometers from the prison. At that time, prison officials said they were investigating rumors that Fromme escaped after hearing that Manson was ill, according to news reports.
FMC-Carswell spokesman Maria Douglas would not comment on Fromme's behavior in prison in recent years.
Fromme allegedly joined Manson's family after meeting him in California in 1967. She was not involved in the murders of seven people, including pregnant actress Sharon Tate, on August 9 and 10, 1969, who overthrew Manson and other supporters in prison. However, she and other followers of Manson kept a vigil outside the courthouse during their trial.
In the WCHS interview, Fromme said Manson shouldn't be jailed because he didn't kill anyone... I'd rather be inside, because I know I put a lot of my thinking into his mind.
Virga said she told the jury that Fromme assaulted Ford, but she didn't try to murder him. If Fromme had killed the president, no one would have heard her, he said. I didn't want people to think I was crazy.
And she was not, she said, remembering that Fromme was very cooperative during her trial and describing her as a brilliant and intelligent young woman from a middle-class family. It's hard to imagine how he caught up with Manson, he said.
Fromme wanted to be heard on issues like the environment, he said. He had certain causes he wanted to talk about. But the first and most important thing in his mind was always Manson.
Explaining to herself after the attempt, according to the book Real Life at the White House, Fromme said: Well, you know, when people treat you like a child and don't pay attention to the things you say, you have to do something.
During his trial, Virga traveled to Washington to depose Ford, who testified on video about the incident.
In the 1978 interview, Fromme called Manson a unique soul in life... he has more heart and spirit than anyone I've ever met. She said she still matched him. He's got everything he wants coming from me, because he gave me everything.
She then said she wasn't planning on looking for a parole hearing: The parole board doesn't have my life in their hands. And I don't want to be too critical, but men tend to think so. Charlie never thought he would. He never expressed all this desire for power, this desire for acceptance.
Ford died in 2006 at the age of 93. The Gerald R. Ford Presidential Foundation did not respond to CNN's requests for comment on the release of Fromme.
Virga, who is still practicing in Sacramento, said he had not heard of Fromme since his sentence in 1975. I wish her well, and I hope everything goes well for her, and I hope she stays out of trouble, she said. She has to stay out of trouble. He's been in prison a long time... it was, in my mind, a tragedy that ended with a disciple of Manson.

"Not so long ago women in the United States were treated as second-class citizens. They do not have the same basic rights as their male counterparts. At one time, women were not allowed to vote, own property or receive education. Since those dark times, the women of America have made great strides in their struggle for equality. One of his heroes was the great Billie Jean King.

King was a professional tennis player, who won great success during her career on the women's tennis court. He won 39 Grand Slam Titles, 12 singles, 16 female doubles and 11 mixed doubles. He found success in almost every place he participated in, including the Federation Cup Championship. King's greatest achievement, however, was an exhibition match that took place in Houston, Texas on September 20, 1973.
The 29-year-old king, who was at the top of his professional career at the time, faced a former Wimbledon champion, Bobby Riggs. Riggs was one of the best male players during his best time in the 1930s and 1940s. Riggs, 55, challenged King to an exhibition game claiming that the game of women was far inferior to that of men. She said that even a 55-year-old ex-player, ""washed"" could beat the best woman in the world. The stage was set for the game. However, it was not a great match at all.
King defeated Riggs without a problem. The game was later exposed by what many people said would be: a showcase for King to show that women could compete against men. Victory was part of the equal rights movement that swept the nation during that time. King became a frank advocate of equal rights for women.",B1
"When you apply for public housing, on request you need to give the names and ages of everyone who will live with you. You will also need to give the address where you currently live and a telephone number you can contact.

In your application, you need to explain why you think you qualify for public housing support. Some reasons may include being veterans, being poor, or living in poor conditions. Bad conditions can mean that the place where you live now is dangerous or can mean that you are in a domestic violence situation. The government will also want to know the name and contact information of your current owner and any owner you had in the past. This is so the government can figure out if you're a good tenant. You'll also have to tell the government how much money you make in a year and how you earn that money. You can't invent that information. You will need to provide your boss's information, old checks, and bank statements.
The government can visit you at your current home and interview you and the people you live with. Other things the government will ask for are your birth certificate and birth certificates from all the people who will live with you and proof that you pay taxes, such as a tax return. If you are eligible for any public housing assistance, you will receive a letter. If you get approved, they'll put you on a waiting list. You can be on the waiting list for a long time before you can actually move to a public housing unit. This is because there are many people who ask and can receive help. Sometimes you can be waiting for years.",B1
"Editor's Note: CNN.com has a business partnership with CareerBuilder.com, which serves as an exclusive provider of job and service listings to CNN.com.
You can sell your skills, your time or your things used to make some extra money.
With an abundance of job losses, wage cuts, eliminated bonuses and a decrease of 401 - LRB- K -RRB- matching contributions, their income is shrinking - but the bills are not n'.
If your normal job isn't to earn enough money or you've lost your job completely, these simple side jobs can help put some stuffing in your pockets until, even later, you get back on your feet.
Here are 10 ways that real people creatively take home some extra mass:
1. Self-employment
Felice Premeau Devine left her lucrative full-time job two years ago to raise her son. In the meantime, she has collected writing and editing independent work and started a blog, where she is able to earn some cash from advertising.
Today, almost any work can be done on a contractual or independent basis. Check out sites like Sologig, which lead job seekers to hire, consult, freelance, temp-to-fire and part-time project opportunities in their field.
2. Sell your books
If you are a college student or stick to your college textbooks thinking you might want to read them again somewhere on the line, select retailers like Barnes & Noble let you sell your textbooks for some quick money. Or, take some classics from your personal library and sell them in a second-hand local bookstore.
3. Find currency in circulation
Susan Headley, the coin guide at About.com, is a lifetime coin collector who has been increasing her revenue by looking through coin circulation for the past six years. In 2008, he won about $2,500 and so far in 2009, he has won approximately $500 of the coins he has found.
People looking for the currency successfully to get a secondary income do so in very large numbers, he says. They buy rolls of coins from banks, typically in whole boxes, and fix them to find things that don't belong, Headley says. Half of the dollars, for example, were no longer made from 90% of the silver after 1965, but they still had 40% of the silver in them until 1970; either of these is a good gain. Presidential dollar errors can be worth $50 to $5,000 each; uncirculated quarters can sell $10 to $50 per roll; and rare error coins can value up to $35,000.
4. Start a business
Turn your hobby, skills, or experience into a part-time business. Sites such as Jobvana can help you do so by providing you with free tools to market your services and offer specialized skills to those seeking help.
Peter Olson says he built a profile in September 2008 offering to teach guitar lessons. Since then he has won two students, earning about $240 an additional month and raising about $1,000 since he started teaching.
5. Enter local and online draws
Wendy Limauge has been entering draws since 1993 and teaching others to win through her website, Sweeties Sweeps, since 2002. Although winning draws rarely provides real cash, her winnings have consistently provided her and her family with 200 to 300 prizes a year, many of them great items that she and her husband could not afford to earn alone.
Among the prizes he has won are three television sets, two of which are flat screen; a home theater system; three dishwashers, each won on separate occasions; at least $1,500 in gift certificates for groceries; a voucher of $18,000 for the vehicle of his choice; a trip to France valued at $25,000; and, in March 2009, he won $5,000 in a game he instantly won.
The Internet has so many options to save money, get something free, win a prize or earn money from home, says Limauge. Just find those resources that offer useful information and sign up in the right direction to get started and stay motivated.
6. Give your opinion... and you get paid.
Linda Childers, a California-based freelance writer, says many of her friends participate in focus groups. Contribute an hour of your time can earn up to $100, sometimes more. Online surveys, phone surveys, and product testing can also earn you from $5 to $150. Check out the free paid surveys or FindFocusGroups.
7. Sell your trash.
Terri Jay earns $2,000 - $3,000 per month only with the sale of scrap metal. On eBay, Jay not only sells things he's not using, but visits local second-hand stores at 99 cents, garage sales, and tackle sales, looking for things she knows the value of. She says that her best sale was for a 70s beverage tray: she paid 25 cents for it and sold it for $87.
The trick is -LSB- to sell -RSB- what you know, she advises. Therefore you can list them -LSB- at correct prices -RSB- so they will be collected in searches -LSB- on eBay -RSB-.
8. Join a Direct Selling Company
Direct selling is one of the easiest ways to earn some extra money, especially if you sell products you love. Avon, for example, allows you to start your own business for $10 -- your taking home depends on your efforts. Some full-time representatives earn six-figure salaries, others own Avon Beauty Centers on license, and many simply sell Avon part-time around their family schedules.
Haizel MacIntyre started his Avon business in June 2008 to earn additional income to his full-time job when her husband was fired. Since joining Avon, MacIntyre has an average of $1,800 a month in sales and her husband is helping her run the business. Her income from Avon helps pay bills, provides extras for her three children, and she is hoping to earn enough to put in for her college tuition when she returns to school to get her master's degree in Social Work.
9. Being a secret buyer
Eyes for detail, as well as a good memory are really all it takes to succeed as a secret buyer, says Zippy Sandler, who has been shopping mysteriously for about 13 years. After registering with a secret commercial company, you are basically paid to go undercover and report on a company's operation from the customer's point of view.
Sandler decided to start secret shopping not only to earn money by eating, traveling and buying, but also to learn customer service skills to pass on to the employees he ran at a retail store. Depending on the customers you're buying for, Sandler says he's won anywhere from $100 to $2,000 a month.
10. Sell your photos to stock agencies
It doesn't matter if you're an amateur, an amateur or an experienced photographer - anyone can send their photos to stock photo agencies like Shutterstock.com. If your images are accepted, they will be available for download by subscribers. Every time someone downloads your photos, you get 25 cents.

"Authorities toured the national park around Mount Rainier in Washington on Sunday for a man who is said to have shot a park ranger fatally and fled into the forest, a spokesman for the park said.
The suspect was released on Sunday night, believed to be somewhere in the extensive park, said spokesman for Mount Rainier Lee Taylor National Park.
Four to five feet of snow is on the ground, including about two feet of fresh dust, where the gunman escaped.
There is a lot of snow on the ground, - LRB- and -RRB- it would be difficult to move quickly, Taylor told CNN. And it's very wooded.
The bloodshed began with what the spokesman called a normal traffic stop around 10:30 a.m. PT-LRB- 1:30 p.m. ET-RRB-. But the suspect did not respond to a request to stop, which led a ranger to the radio requesting help.
The 34-year-old park ranger Margaret Anderson responded to that call and established her patrol vehicle as a roadblock.
When he—LRB—the shooter—RRB—came to that place, he got—LRB—out of his car—RRB—and shot him fatally, Taylor said.
The suspect then ran to the spacious national park, whose border is about 50 kilometers south-east of Seattle. The park, the centerpiece is Mount Rainier of 14,410 feet, which is considered an active volcano, comprises 235,625 acres in the Cascada Range.
Tickets to the park were closed after the shooting. Taylor said authorities were able to evacuate most people safely, with more than 100 people locked up in our primary visitor center with food, water and five law enforcement agents on call.
We don’t want to try to get those people to their vehicle and caravan on the park road where it could be dangerous, being shot by a gunman, the spokesman said Sunday night. So for now, they're gonna sit tight in the visitor center.
Anderson was the mother of a 4-year-old and 1-year-old boy and the wife of a fellow park ranger, according to Taylor.
A ranger at Mount Rainier for the past four years, Anderson was at work not for money or glory, but for a love of wild places and national parks, Taylor said.
Her husband survived, who is also a park ranger, as well as a 4-year-old boy and a 1-year-old boy.
He was a person with a quick smile, a very kind person, a very competent ranger, Taylor said. This gunman took the life of someone who had a lot to live for and was making great contributions to society as a national park ranger.
CNN's Adam Shivers contributed to this report.

"Today many people are fans of social media. They are always looking at their mobile phones or tablets, and updating their Twitter or Facebook accounts. They're taking pictures of what they eat, or taking pictures of themselves, which is called ""selfies."" When people don't share too much, they are constantly reading or looking at what friends and family members are publishing. Social media is getting addicted.

Research shows that most people spend almost 4 hours a day on social media on average. That's almost 30 hours a week. While some people need and use social media to work or to stay in touch with friends, others find that using social media causes anxiety and stress. People also tend to use social media as a way of procrastinating. So like many religions asking people to abstain, or not to have certain foods or drinks for a while, many people are taking fasts on social media. They're not updating their states, and they're not reading what other people are publishing either. They choose to stay away from social media for 30 days.
Ironically, the details of these fasts can be found on social networking sites all over the Internet. The reasons why people undertake a fast are varied. Some people want to reconnect with their families or friends by disconnecting from their cell phones. Some people want to be more productive at work. What did some do faster instead of logging in? Some decided to connect with friends by sitting down and having face-to-face conversations. If friends or loved ones were far away, they would instead call them on the phone. Some even wrote postcards or handwritten letters. The results were mixed. Some people felt that not using social media made them more anxious. Others developed more positive habits such as daily or meditation.",B1
"His was one of the first pictures of a missing child that appeared in a carton of milk. Almost 30 years later, Etan Patz is still missing.
Etan Patz, who disappeared in 1979, was the first child to disappear in the milk carton campaigns of the 1980s.
Etan was 6 years old when he disappeared on May 25, 1979, Friday before Memorial Day. I was on my way to school in what is now the exclusive Soho neighborhood of New York.
It was the first time I walked to the bus stop alone. It was a few blocks from here. Etan, like any 6-year-old, argued that all his friends walked to the bus stop alone, and his parents gave in.
His mother, Julie Patz, found out that Etan had not been to class when he did not return home. He called the school at 3:30 p.m., then called all his friends' houses. When no one had seen Etan, he called the police and filed a missing person's report.
At night, more than 100 police officers and search engines had met with hounds. The search continued for weeks, but no trace of Etan's whereabouts was found. See an update on the case
The disappearance of the child was one of the main events that inspired the movement of missing children, which raised awareness about the abduction of children and gave rise to new ways of searching for missing children. The case of Etan was the first of the milk carton campaigns of the mid-1980s.
In our minds there were only two possibilities, said Stan Patz, the child's father. Either Etan was taken by a stranger and killed or was taken by a very sad woman desperate for a child of her own, and we hoped that such a woman would at least take care of him and keep him safe.
Patz lived with this hope until 1982, when he found out about José Antonio Ramosarrest and the surprising connection between him and an old nanny from Etan.
Ramos was a vagabond who in 1979 lived in Alphabet City, a neighborhood not far from Soho. In 1982 he was arrested after the boys in a Bronx neighborhood complained that he had stolen his bags of books while trying to put them in a drain under a bridge, where he lived, said the Patzes and federal prosecutor Stuart GraBois, who spent years investigating the case.
When the police found Ramos in his house, they found that he had many photographs of blond little children. They realized that they looked a lot like Etan Patz, according to author Lisa R Cohen's book on the case, After Etan: The Missing Child Case that Held America Captive.
The Bronx police questioned Ramos, and denied having anything to do with Etan's disappearance. But he told the police that his girlfriend used to take care of the child, GraBois said.
The Bronx and Manhattan prosecutors followed this lead, but concluded that they did not have enough evidence to connect Ramos to Etan's disappearance, said GraBois and a spokesman for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.
Ramos was released when the parents of the Bronx children decided not to press charges against him, according to published reports. He left town and disappeared for six years... until Grabois reviewed Etan's case. Grabois said he focused on Ramos as the prime suspect.
GraBois said he learned in 1988 that Ramos had been arrested and convicted of child abuse and was serving a sentence in a Pennsylvania prison.
GraBois said he took Ramos to New York to question him and surprised him with the question: How many times did you have sex with Etan Patz?
Ramos told GraBois that he had taken a little boy to an apartment he had on the lower East Side the same day that Etan disappeared. I was 90 percent sure it was the same thing I had seen on the missing news, GraBois said.
According to GraBois, Ramos claimed that he released the boy and took him to a subway station so that the boy could visit his aunt in Washington Heights.
Etan didn't have an aunt in Washington Heights, GraBois said. When asked more, Ramos refused to say anything else and asked for a lawyer, according to GraBois.
Ramos is serving a sentence of 10 to 20 years in prison in Pennsylvania. It is scheduled to be released in November 2012, said GraBois.
GraBois said he had moved Ramos to a federal prison, and planted informants as cellmates. I wouldn't go into details about what Ramos might have told you, but he said he's convinced he's looking at the right suspect.
GraBois handed over his evidence to the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, but prosecutors have not filed charges. They say without a body, they don't have enough evidence.
The case of Etan is still considered by the NYPD as an unsolved case.
Anyone with information about Etan Patz's whereabouts or leading to the arrest and conviction of the person responsible for his disappearance should call the FBI/NYPD Etan Patz hotline: 212-384-2200.

"Green is not the first word that appears in most people's heads when they think of New York. However, in the middle of Manhattan Island is the most visited park in the United States, with 35 million visitors a year. Central Park, a National Historic Monument, occupies 843 acres of land. It is a green space where people will escape the noise and crowds of urban life. Before opening in 1857, it was not an empty space. People lived in that land. They were mostly poor free blacks, Irish and Italian immigrants. They were forced to leave the grounds to build the park.

A section of the park is called Sheep Meadow. Now it's just a lawn area where people can lie in the sun, but the royal sheep used to graze there from 1864 to 1934. The sheep from there were finally moved to another park in the city. Many events take place in Central Park, especially in the hot spring and summer months. There is an open-air theatre, where Shakespeare's plays are performed. The works are free, which causes such a high demand that people align for hours before the performances to enter. There are also free music concerts. Every summer a stage is set up. These Summer Stage concerts feature musicians from all over the world. Both the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and the Metropolitan Opera also host free performances in the park in spring and summer. There are also two small zoos inside the park, and a series of small lakes in the park. One of the lakes rents small mechanical sailboats. There is also a puppet theatre and a children's carousel.
The park isn't dead in winter. When it snows, families usually go sledding or ice skating on an outdoor rink owned by Donald Trump.",B1
"Miley Cyrustour's American leg has officially ended, thanks to an extreme allergic reaction to an antibiotic.
His representative issued a statement on Friday indicating that all the remaining dates in the US. at the Miley Cyrus Bangerztour have been postponed. That means the programs scheduled for next week for Philadelphia, at Foxwoods casino in Connecticut, and on Long Island, New York are officially out, at least for now.
The announcement is not entirely unexpected: his representative said Thursday that the artist might need much more time to recover from the disease that landed him in a Kansas City hospital last week.
Sick of waking up with needles, Cyrus, 21, tweeted on Friday. # Go through it.
The singer canceled a show in Charlotte, North Carolina, last week because of what was reported to be a flu-like illness. But the severity of his condition was not fully known until this week, when he canceled performances in Kansas City and St. Louis.
In a statement, his camp explained that Cyrus had a sinus infection while in North Carolina, he was then prescribed the antibiotic Cephalexin, which has now suffered an extreme allergic reaction.
This type of extreme reaction can last from five to 27 days in such cases, the statement said.
She will remain hospitalized and is under the care of a doctor until we see any improvement in her condition and is asking for her compassion and privacy at this time. Miley is devastated by the lost shows and possibly disappointing her fans.
But it looks like Cyrus won't be off the stage for long.
His representative said that on Friday the European stage of the tour would take place as planned, starting from a date of 2 May in Amsterdam.
This summer, she should be back partying in the U.S., as she tuned into one of her best-known hits.
A lot of new shows, which were performed between August 1st and August 14th, were announced on Friday to replace the recently canceled ones. Those dates include two additional shows in Pittsburgh and Chicago.

"Self-portrait is nothing new. Painters and photographers have always been used as subjects. Today, however, almost everyone walks with a camera in their pocket. This is because most cell phones have cameras on them. The fact that most people have cell phone cameras with them all the time has led to an increase in selfie. A selfie is a self-portrait usually taken with a cell phone.

Since photos are usually taken on a cell phone, many people tend to share these pictures with friends and even strangers on different social media websites. Some of the popular social media platforms people use to share selfies include Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook.
People usually take selfies when they engage in normal day-to-day activities. They take selfies from their trips to work or school. People take selfies from themselves by eating. Other people take selfies to show what they're using or who they're dating.
The most common way to take a selfie is by holding a cell phone at arm length. Some people take selfies by taking a picture of their reflection in a mirror. In these photos, you can usually see the phone with which the person is taking a picture. Selfies taken using a mirror are often taken in a bathroom, which some people think is offensive. The bathroom is a very private place, not a place to take pictures.
Some people think selfies are a sign that people are becoming vain or superficial. It's not often that people take pictures of themselves that make them look bad. When people take pictures of themselves, they are usually trying to show up in the best light. However, some people use selfies to show what they really look like. Some people are trying to challenge stereotypes of what makes someone attractive.",B1
"Cameron Russell intends to open the media landscape to divergent voices a little at a time. In March, he helped launch the magazine Interrupt, initially a webzine, so that these other perspectives can join the media conversation. His first issue is dedicated to body image.
Russell is familiar with how women are portrayed in the media. He has been a model of brands such as Victoria's Secret, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren and Benetton and has appeared on the pages of Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and W.
She is also known for her TEDx talk, Looks Aren't Everything, about those who win the genetic lottery and how society rewards the conventionally beautiful.
To celebrate the launch of the magazine Interrupt, it is inviting the public to an art lab called You Are a Genius in the Lower East Side of New York until Monday. It's on 215 Bowery Street.
CNN recently spoke to Russell about his new project.
CNN: How did the idea come about?
Cameron Russell: I had been thinking about an online participatory magazine for a while. After the incredible response to my TEDx talk, my Brooklyn-based art lab decided it was time to make this a reality. At Big Bad Lab, we build participatory art and media platforms for causes, communities and organizations that matter to us. I run the magazine with Hannah Assebe and Allison Bland, as well as hundreds of contributors who provide writing, photos, editing help and moral support.
CNN: Why interrupt?
Russell: Statistics show that diversity in the media is rather sad. In many important conversations critical voices of women and people of color are lacking. Have you ever seen an immigration panel without any immigrants? Abortion without women? Marriage rights without LGBTQ people? We knew it was crazy to start another media platform, but we found a lot of authentic online and offline voices that we felt we could gather and show. Sometimes you just have to interrupt!
CNN: What are the highlights in the first issue?
It's all about body image. We found that 50% of 8-year-old girls don't like their body. But they're not just girls. Many women said they couldn't remember a time when they liked their bodies, that they couldn't remember how they felt.
We collaborated with the interrupted photographer Marie C. who interviewed girls under the age of 8 asking what they liked about their bodies. Their responses shed light on a missing perspective in media conversations. These girls liked their bodies because they worked well! Instead of the usual negative views -- I'm too fat or I don't like my nose -- these girls appreciate the fact that they can draw with their hands and run fast with their legs. It's refreshing. His story was a great success and obtained more than 5,000 shares.
Then there's Teagan Widmer, a transgender woman who wrote about trying to find the right bra. His story is not exactly something the general press would cover. But when we published his advice to our Tumblr site it became one of the most popular stories.
The lesson here is that when we value a narrow range of experiences and perspectives, we not only have a media that lacks diversity, we actually underestimate our audience. There are not only a few types of experiences that matter -- there are countless.
CNN: With so many publications in digital format, what made you decide to publish a magazine?
Russell: Our first printed number is a simulated tabloid. Starting this week, it appears free of charge in beauty salons, kiosks, dentists' offices and other not-so-hidden places in New York City. Improving access to the media means not only focusing on first adopters. We are spending our resources on building a community of collaborators who can share unique and critical views.
CNN: What has been the most interesting experience in the launch of Interrupt?
Russell: Actually, I think working at Genius Offline Lab. We wanted to build a space where people felt comfortable and great in their identity. We have two walls of selfie because taking a selfie is an innate and obvious way that attracts many young people. We have a You Are to Geniusbar, where people can explore online resources for social services, civic engagement, health and well-being, and creative production.
Having an offline physical space where kids, teens, and random passers-by can get in and get involved is amazing. Take a look at our Tumblr feed. Many of these people spent more than an hour here, took pictures, wrote pieces for the next issue and came out. Sometimes, a great collaboration is difficult to nurture online so doing it offline is the way to go. We hope to run another one this fall. Stay tuned.
CNN: How do you spread the word?
Russell: The first hundreds of presentations came from people who learned about the project online, mainly via Twitter. Now that we are more involved in the project, we have cultivated many more collaborations. For example, -LRB- check out -RRB- a great piece we did with teenagers at the South End Technology Center in Boston. We have found artists like Ernest English, who made a piece that is attracting the greatest attention at the Genius Laboratory.
CNN: What is the biggest difference between your webzine and Buzzfeed?
Russell: There are a lot of new media startups strongly focused on getting big traffic and high growth, but that's not our central goal. We want to build something that alters the way we think the media can be done.
Can interruption have an impact?
Russell: Every time someone who is not a media creator creates something that goes viral, every time someone whose perspective is left out of mainstream media proves to have an impact, every time a collaborator collaborates with someone new to do a better job, we improve the media landscape a little bit.
CNN: What did you want to be when you grew up?
I always wanted to be president! When I was a kid, I was obsessed with politics. The first long book I remember reading was -LRB- Richard -RRB- Neustadt's presidential power in fourth grade. But as I learned more about our democracy, I realized that who participates, who votes and who is elected is not as simple as it seems. That made me interested in how to bring people together and turn on alternative networks of power, and that's why I started the Big Bad Lab.
Who are your heroes?
Russell: I'm inspired by the people I work with. At Genius Lab, we have three amazing artists. Ernest English makes huge public works of art participative. Adalky Capellan is a young woman who creates a large-scale job. When I saw his photos, I knew it was perfect to make our selfie of dreamy wall background. And then there's the graffiti artist and muralist known as miss163. She is a joy working with her, and her piece is all about love, which is great for us as one of our next issues is about LGBT.
CNN: If you can give advice to young women, what would it be?
Russell: When the kids at school told me I couldn't play their game, my mom told me to ask: Why, do you need a penis to play?

"Taxes are special fees charged by a government to people living in a country, state or city. These fees help pay for public services such as police, road and bridge repair, and public schools. In the United States, people have to pay national, state and local taxes. Income tax is a tax applied to how much money a person earns in a year. There are federal and state income taxes. These have to be paid every year by April 15. There are special ways that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the government agency responsible for collecting taxes, asks people to fill in. There are tax credits that low-income people, college students and parents can get. These credits could mean recovering money from the government. This money is called a tax refund. People can get a federal and state tax refund. Anyone who works has to be taxed regardless of immigration status. Failure to pay income taxes could mean a fine or even a jail time.

Payroll taxes are taxes that are taken directly from a person's paycheck. There are federal and state taxes on payroll. These include Social Security and Medicare taxes. Social Security taxes pay for retirement and disability benefits received by millions of Americans each year. Medicare taxes pay for the federal health insurance program that covers the elderly and the disabled.
People who own houses pay property taxes. The amount paid depends on how much the property is worth. This tax is usually paid once a year. Sales tax is a tax that almost everyone pays. Sales tax is a specific additional percentage that is charged on almost all purchases. Everything, from soap to furniture, has a sales tax when bought.

"On 26 December 2004, a 10-minute earthquake with a magnitude of 9.3 occurred in the Indian Ocean. This massive earthquake, the third strongest ever recorded in history, triggered several powerful tsunamis that reached more than a dozen coasts of countries. Nearly 230,000 people died from the catastrophe, and hundreds of thousands of others were injured or missing. In the midst of all the devastation caused by this disaster, many surprising and inspiring survival stories have emerged. One of the most extraordinary is the story of a young woman named Wati.

The tsunami hit his hometown of Aceh when he was only eight years old. Like so many others, the powerful waves separated her from her family, and she ended up being dragged into an unknown village. After many years of searching for her, her family surrendered and assumed that she had died after being swept away. Miraculously, Wati was returned to her parents seven years later, at the age of 15.
According to Wati, she had been ""adopted"" by a stranger who found her in the streets after the tsunami. Although the woman took her to live with her, she forced Wati to beg in the streets and often beat her if she did not earn enough money. The girl had tried to find her family asking for help from strangers, but she did not remember the names of her parents and could only vaguely remember that she had a grandfather named Ibraham.
Finally, one day, a taxi driver who heard the story of Watti met an old man with that name in a nearby town and decided to take her with him. Although the old man did not recognize her at first, he took Wati to see his daughter. ""When I saw my mother, I knew it was her,"" said the 15-year-old. ""I just knew."" The parents were able to confirm that she was really his daughter based on a scar and birthmark on the girl's hip. This miraculous story is unfortunately one of the only confirmed meetings between families that were separated by the disaster.",B1

The top 10 heroes were nominated by CNN's global audience and profiled earlier this year on CNN. Each will receive $50,000 and be honored on CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute, a worldwide broadcast event broadcast on December 1.
One of the top 10 will receive an additional $250,000 for their cause if the public chooses them as CNN Hero of the Year.
Starting Thursday morning, you can vote for your favorite hero at CNNHeroes.com or from your mobile device. The vote ends on 17 November.
Last year's Hero of the Year was Pushpa Basnet, a Nepalese woman who supports her children so they don't have to live behind bars with their imprisoned parents.
She started a home in Kathmandu where children can receive education, food, medical care, and an opportunity to live a more normal life.
These kids haven't done anything wrong. “They are simply caught up in something they do not understand,” Basnet said. We want to work with the government to get them all out of jail. And they deserve a better future.
Robin Lim, the hero of the year in 2011, was recognized for helping thousands of poor Indonesians have a healthy pregnancy and childbirth.
“I found that if you have a good idea and do it with love, many people want to help you,” Lim said.
This is the seventh year CNN has conducted its annual search for CNN Heroes. In those years, the campaign has profiled more than 200 people on CNN and CNN.com.
This year's tribute show will be held in New York and will be hosted by Cooper at the American Museum of Natural History.

"Susan grew up in Lincoln, Nebraska, the heart of the United States. Remember to play in the corn fields as a child, and see miles and miles of land stretching as far as I could see. One day her aunt took her to see the 1997 Titanic film starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. He marveled at the vast ocean. It was something she'd never seen before. Remember he turned to his aunt to say, ""I'm going on a boat like that one day, Auntie.""

True to his words, Susan left Nebraska and moved to Los Angeles, California. She wanted to live near the ocean, and was delighted to discover that Queen Mary was permanently docked in Long Beach. The big boat, which is the same size as the Titanic, is now a museum and a tourist attraction. He didn't hesitate to book a boat tour. ""This is wonderful,"" she thought herself.
Upon arrival on board, Susan was not disappointed. It was all she expected it to be. The ship was restored to its original state, which was very luxurious. His tour highlighted the history and importance of the ship over the years. He ate at one of the three restaurants, and stayed the night at the boat's hotel. Queen Mary was built in the 1930s in Britain, and enjoyed many years sailing across the Atlantic Ocean. He hosted many dignitaries such as Winston Churchill, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, and many Hollywood celebrities. During World War II, the ship was assigned as a troop transport where it was used to transport up to 18,000 allied soldiers per trip.
After the war, he was restored to his original state, and began his transatlantic journeys. In 1967, the city of Long Beach bought the old transatlantic, and has been a popular attraction for the city ever since. ""It's a living story,"" Susan said, after her visit.

"Designer Isaac Mizrahi, dressed in black, wears a suit that seems to contradict his personality and his usual fashion style.
Isaac Mizrahi has won four awards from the Council of Fashion Designers of America.
I always start with color when I'm designing things. Always. If the color is correct, I feel better, he plays on his website.
But Mizrahi has an explanation for her less than colorful outfit on a recent visit to CNN Center in Atlanta.
We have a very fast trip, and we have to go back and there's no time to pack and we can't check the luggage... so I concentrated it in black, gray and white.
It's just one more style tip you can pick from Mizrahi's new book How to Have Style -LRB- Gotham -RRB-. Despite the slightly bold title, Mizrahi, who has won four awards from the Council of Fashion Designers of America, has earned the right to tell women how to dress.
For five years, New York fashion designer has been selling low-priced clothing and home furnishings at Target. But with her new book comes a new job -- like Liz Claiborne's creative director.
CNN talked to Mizrahi about his love of theater, the most common fashion mistakes and why bad flowers are never right. The following is an edited version of that interview:
CNN: You started performing at the High School of Performing Arts. How do you combine that love and your love for design?
Isaac Mizrahi: Well, you know what, I think it's all theater. I think fashion is a form of entertainment. And I think these days, as a fashion designer, it's almost like you represent a political party or something.
As women say, that's a brand name I associate with because I've used it before. I love it. It seems to fulfill who I really am easily. Whatever it is, she knows it just makes her life really easy, so she associates with her, you know? And in the end, I'm like this personality that represents that. See Mizrahi talk about his new book
But more than that, I have designs -LSB- in -RSB- the entertainment business. There's a movie called Unzipped about me that was a very successful movie. I had two TV shows. I design costumes constantly for theatre, ballet and opera. So it's a great world for me. It's perfect for me.
CNN: How is your daily schedule? It's got to be crazy about everything you do.
Mizrahi: It changes every day, and I really like that. There's a basis for it. I wake up, go swimming every day, and eat the same breakfast almost every day. But when I get to work, that's when it changes.
Some days I work in the exhibition room; some days I work in the design room; some days I really work in my own private studio, where I only do sketches and sketches and sketches. Other days I work in the TV studio recording segments and my web program.
I don't love traveling. I feel like you really interrupt what I like to do the most, which is this creation, you know what I mean? When I finally let myself enjoy it, I can enjoy traveling. But it takes me a great agony to separate myself from New York City and my studies and the people I work with.
Say you're walking down the street. What's the most common style mistake you see in people?
Mizrahi: I see a lot, a lot, a lot of bad hair. I'd say that's the most common style mistake I see is bad hair.
You know people have excuses for bad shoes -- because you know some people have back problems, it's the street and they're walking and walking and walking -- but I think people have no excuse for bad hair. Because you know what? There's a hat, if your hair is so bad that day.
But I always think women should be encouraged to spend a lot of money on their hair. It's like you should spend more money... on your hair. You'd think I had a chain of hairdressers, but I don't have them. - Lsb-Laughter-RSB-.
CNN: What about home decoration? You make a line for Target that ends this year. What is the most common mistake that people make there?
Mizrahi: Do you know what it is with people? I think people get lazy when it comes to being home... they leave things around them. I like to think about cabinets. I like to keep things as much as possible. Is it like going out on the table? No. You put the salt pans in a closet, and the table looks much better when it's simple. You know what I mean?
And people think bad flowers are better than nothing, but I don't agree with that. I think nothing's better than bad flowers. Either you have beautiful flowers, or you don't have flowers. Like dinner, I'd rather there aren't flowers than the flowers people have on the table. That's horrible, but it's true.
CNN: How has your personal style evolved over time?
Mizrahi: It has become much quieter, my personal style. I used to dress, dress, dress, dress, dress, and I don't know, dress in a very particular way now and it's almost like a watch. And every now and then I go out and do something crazy.
CNN: Can you describe your personality to me, and how it affects your style?
I don't know. It's very difficult to describe one's personality. I can't say about my personality, but I like to think that I'm very exposed to what's happening in the world culturally, and that's what influences my design.
It's like here are the 360 degrees of what's going on -LSB- in -RSB- the world culturally, you know? Socioeconomically, culturally, and here is my answer to it. This is what clothes look like; this is what you should be wearing. And it's like a wonderful edge, you're standing, and yet there's enough space there for your own interpretation or to move in one direction or another.
Oh! Here is a good description of my personality: claustrophobic. I'm very claustrophobic. I don't like to commit to one thing necessarily, but when I commit to it, it's complete and complete.

"Julie was sitting in bed late at night playing with her new smartphone. Earlier that week, she had been visited by her children and grandchildren to celebrate her 70th birthday, and had received the phone as a gift from her granddaughter Mary. Julie had been a widow for five years. As she lived hours away from the rest of the family, Mary thought the phone would be a good way to stay in touch and take part of her time.

Until then, Julie had never really been interested in catching up with modern technology, but finally owning her own smartphone made her feel young, and decided to join Facebook as that was what she had noticed all the young people were doing. However, by making her profile page, she was ashamed to put a picture of herself as she thought she seemed too wrinkled and no one would want to talk to her. To remedy this, she downloaded a photo of a beautiful 20-year-old Google, posted it under her name, and went to sleep.
The next morning, Julie woke up and enthusiastically entered Facebook hoping that she would have one or two new friends. I couldn't believe what I saw. Her inbox was filled with requests from friends of dozens and dozens of handsome young men who were complementing her beauty and wanted to know everything about her. Julie decided to accept only the most handsome and started chatting with them day and night, without letting them know that they were actually talking to a grandmother. Next time Julie met Mary, she thanked her very much on the phone and commented, ""I haven't felt so young and pretty in years!"" Mary was confused and asked, ""Why?"" Julie just gave a naughty smile and changed the subject.",B1
"A school bus carrying Maxwell High School students rolled over to the corner of Seally Street and Wilten Avenue. The bus driver was trying to avoid hitting a car that passed a red light, and the bus overturned with 37 students inside. The driver was slightly injured in the face, and two students broke their arms.

Roger Peterson, director of Maxwell High School, said the driver wasn't to blame. His reaction helped prevent serious injuries. As soon as the bus overturned, the driver opened the door with the emergency handle and began to evacuate the students one by one. Notifys the police of the students who were injured.
""We teach our drivers to ensure the safety of students first,"" Peterson said. The driver, whose name is not being released at this time due to an investigation, along with the two students are being taken care of at Belmont Hospital. Parents were notified as soon as possible by school officials.
According to John Pineda, who witnessed the accident, the school bus almost ran over the car. ""The bus didn't go so fast, but the other car did. If the bus had hit the car, those people inside would surely have been seriously injured, or worse,"" Pineda said. Pineda also said that the school bus driver took precautions to turn where people did not walk. If I had made a right, instead of a left, I would definitely have hit people across the street.
Peterson issued a statement saying that students who were inside the bus could skip school the next day to make sure they were okay, and relax with their family. According to Peterson, the police provided him with a list of the students who participated in the accident. The police are looking for the driver of the car who passed the red light. It was a white Honda Civic.",B1
"When Christopher Lee was young, he dreamed of being an English teacher. He worked hard on this by first going to a community college after high school before moving to the University of California, Los Angeles. At UCLA, Chris obtained his bachelor's degree in English, but still needed his master's degree to teach at the university. Chris met George while taking a class at his old community college. George was a news reporter, who told Chris how much he enjoyed his work. Chris was very interested in his story.

It turned out that George was also an English student, but he turned to journalism because he wanted to be published. George told Chris one day, ""Chris, I've met a lot of English students who want to be published, but I never had that chance. In journalism, it can be published, and it is published often."" Chris thought of his words and asked him how he became a journalist. George laughed and said, ""Start with Journalism 101.""
Chris followed his advice, and soon fell in love with writing in journalistic style. His short and precise method of writing appealed to Chris. Journalists deal only with the facts. It's not like writing in English. You don't paint pictures in journalism; you report facts. There is a measure of creativity involved with writing in a journalistic style, but it is different from English.
Soon, Chris obtained his certificate, and then obtained his master's degree in journalism. Now he works for a great daily newspaper. He is very grateful to his old friend George, who introduced him to journalism. It has now been published more than 200 times. George changed Christopher's course of life.",B1
"
Donald had a rough morning. He had an argument with his wife, so he thought it would be a good idea to finish a package of six beers and a handful of prescription pain pills. This would have been nice if he'd stayed inside his house. Instead, drunk and drugged, Donald started harassing his neighbor next door. First he knocked on his neighbor's door. Then he broke the glass panel from a porch light. He finally pulled the wires from the light from the wall. That was the last drop. Neighbor called the police. The police came and arrested Donald for public intoxication and disturbing the peace. Donald was taken to a nearby prison. His stay only lasted a few hours. As soon as he was soberer, the police released him. Apparently, Donald wasn't sober enough.

When he was released, Donald realized that he was quite far from home. He didn't feel like walking nearly two miles, so he called his friend from jail to come look for him. But Donald was getting impatient. When a woman left her car in the parking lot, she tried to get in. The woman screamed for help. Donald shouted, ""But this is my car!"" The woman kept screaming and Donald came out. Then he thought it would be a good idea to take the bus home. A deputy was watching and arrested Donald again, after he had only been free for an hour. This time, however, Donald's prison stay would not be so short. He was charged with attempted robbery. A judge set his bail at $10,000. He didn't have $10,000, so he's still in jail awaiting trial.",B1
"Today's grandparents join their grandchildren on social media, but the online habits of different generations could not be more different. In the UK, those over 55 years of age join Facebook in increasing numbers, which means that they will soon be the second largest user group on the site, with 3.5 million users aged 55 to 64 and 2.9 million over 65 years of age.
Sheila, 59, says, ""I joined in to see what my grandchildren are doing, while my daughter posts videos and photos of them. It's a much better way to see what they're doing than waiting for letters and photos in the post. That's how we did it when I was a kid, but I think I'm lucky to be able to see much more of their lives than my grandparents.
Ironically, Sheila's grandchildren are less likely to use Facebook themselves. Children under the age of 17 in the UK are leaving the site (only 2.2 million users are under the age of 17), but they are not far from their smartphones. Chloe, 15, even sleeps with her phone. ""It's my alarm clock, so I have to,"" he says. I look at him before I go to sleep and as soon as I wake up.
Unlike her grandmother's generation, Chloe's age group is spending so much time on their phones at home that they're missing out on spending time with their friends in real life. Sheila, on the other hand, has made contact with old school friends she hasn't heard of in forty years. ""We use Facebook to organize to meet across the country,"" he says. It's completely changed my social life.
Teenagers can have their parents to thank for their smartphone and social media addiction, as their parents were the first to adopt the smartphone. Pedro, 38 years old and father of two teenagers, reports that he used to be on his phone or laptop constantly. ""I was always connected and I felt like I was always working,"" he says. 'How could I tell my children to get off their phones if I was always in front of a screen?' So, at nights and weekends, you pull your SIM card out of your smartphone and put it on an old-style mobile phone that can only make calls and send text messages. ""I am not completely isolated from the world in case of emergencies, but the important thing is that I am setting a better example for my children and spending more quality time with them.""
Is it only a matter of time before the generation above and below Peter reaches the new trend for a less digital life?",B1
"Since Mary moved to the United States a year ago, she often heard the phrase ""there's no such thing as free lunch."" Although she understood that this means that you can't get anything for nothing, she heard other mothers at her son's school talking about the free lunch program.

""How much does it cost to sign up?"" Mary asked the secretary at her son's school. The secretary smiled and told Mary it didn't cost anything except a little time. To find out if Mary's son was qualified to get free lunch at school, he had to fill out a form. The form was available in many languages in addition to English. He asked Mary basic questions such as where she lived, how many children she had and what her annual income was.
Filling out the form was easy, and Mary did not have to include proof of her income. However, it is concerned that information on the form is shared with other agencies. The secretary told him that the information was not shared. If Mary earned below a certain amount a year, her son could eat free not only during the school year, but also during the summer, when there was no school.
Mary knew this would help her family. While Mary worked, she only worked part-time. Giving your child money for lunch every day added up and impacted the family budget.
After filling out and sending the form back to the school secretary, Maria had to wait a month or two before finding out if she was qualified. A few weeks after submitting the form, a letter arrived by mail. The letter informed him that his son was qualified. The letter also told her that her son could also have free breakfast at school.",B1
"An 85-year-old woman in Tennessee named Astrid became a multimillionaire overnight after winning a $500 million lottery jackpot. However, his path to wealth was not completely smooth. His story reminds us that to win the lottery, there are two crucial requirements. The first and most obvious need is a lot of luck. The second requirement is just as important, but much less often it is mentioned: to organize.

Astrid's story began when he lined up for a lottery ticket at his local supermarket. The woman ahead of her decided to let me cut her in front of her to pay. This woman was also planning to buy a lottery ticket. If I hadn't given Astrid his place on the line, the lottery money would have been his!
The day the winners were announced, Astrid realized he had won, he could not contain his emotion. He danced joyfully throughout his house and jumped on the phone to tell his closest relatives what had just happened. The next morning Astrid woke up and prepared to go and claim his prize, but suddenly he realized that he could not remember where he had placed his ticket. Since his memory was no longer as sharp as it used to be, he searched and searched his messy house for hours in vain. He had absolutely no memory of where he could have stored or dropped the ticket.
Astrid had received thirty days to claim his prize, or else it would be cancelled. For 27 days, his schedule was dedicated to searching every surface and square foot of his house for the lost ticket. Just three days later, he finally decided to call his daughters for help. She had been too embarrassed to call them from the beginning because her house was so messy, but now she had no choice. Assuming that helping his mother find the ticket would probably assure them at least an extra million dollars, Astrid's three daughters immediately headed home.
In the first half hour of searching, the youngest of her daughters shouted, ""I found him!"" Turns out Astrid had left it in a plate closet. ""Oh, thank you, daughter!"" Astrid cried. ""I owe you so much!"" Her daughter's smile shone with pride as her two sisters frowned at her from the next room.",B1
"A Virginia Tech graduate student was murdered Wednesday night when a man she knew attacked her with a knife and beheaded her, a school spokesman said.
Virginia Chief of Police Tech Wendell Flintum talks about the first murder on campus since the 2007 shootings.
Mark Owczarski, Virginia Tech spokesman, said Thursday that the murder of Xin Yang was the first on campus since April 16, 2007, when a shooter killed 32 people before shooting himself.
Yang, 22, from Beijing, China, was killed at Au Bon Pain Restaurant at the Life Center Graduate around 7 p.m., said school spokesman Larry Hincker in a written statement.
Campus police arrested 25-year-old Haiyang Zhu at the crime scene. Ningbo native, China, has been charged with first-degree murder and is being held without bail in a local jail, Hincker said.
Zhu didn't say anything to the officers who arrested him, Wendell Flintum campus police chief said.
“There was blood in it,” Flintum said. The young woman and the suspect were not seen arguing, or anything of that nature, she added, citing witness statements.
Authorities said the two students knew each other. Based on emergency contact records maintained by the university, Zhu and Yang are known to know each other, Hincker said. No further details were provided.
The young woman arrived at university two weeks ago to begin accounting studies, she said in the statement.
Zhu is a graduate student who follows a doctorate in agricultural and applied economics. He began his studies at Virginia Tech in the fall of 2008, Hincker said.
Our hearts are with the victim and her family, President Charles W. Steger said in a letter to the campus community.
An act of violence like this brings back memories of the tragedy of 16 April and I have no doubt that many of us are particularly distressed.
Authorities say that on 16 April 2007, Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 students and teachers before committing suicide.

"Event planning team
online
All right, so I've split the tasks between the three of us planning this event like this:
@Jen: make guest list, schedule ads on social networks, organize room settings, organize musicians
@Ed: book catering, sending invitations, design posters, book speakers
@Mike: book rooms, design invitations, write and post blog, get emcee
But please don't feel like we have to stick to this. If you'd rather do something else, don't hesitate to say it.
Mike, 14:41.
Yeah, I was thinking, since you're the project leader @Mike, maybe you'd better make the guest list? I have experience in graphic design, so I'm happy to design the invitations.
Jen, 14:50.
@Jen, do you mind designing the posters too? I'm not very good at designing.
Ed, 14:55
Sure, it'll be fun. If I take off the design of the @Ed poster, do you think you can organize the musicians?
Jen, 14:56
Absolutely, I know some very good musicians who do events like this. And I also know a very good master of ceremonies. You want me to get the Emcee, too?
Ed, 14:58
@Ed I actually already have an emissary in mind so I think I'll take care of that. I would appreciate it if you could write and post the blog about the event.

If that's the case, @Ed do you want to program ads on social media as well?
Jen, 15:03
I can do that... if someone saves the speakers.

I'm gonna book the speakers. And since I'm making the guest list, I should send the invitations as well. @Jen, do you still agree to arrange the configuration of the room?

"Rory McIlroy has a good start at the Scottish Open. He also expects a good ending, after missing the cut at the Irish Open.
McIlroy made a record of 7 minus 64 at Royal Aberdeen on Thursday, and was actually the second player to improve the old brand -- Kristoffer Broberg of Sweden had shot a 65.
McIlroy carted eight birds and a bogey in cold, windy conditions.
Leaving this morning in these conditions I thought anything in the '60s would be a good score, so to film something better than that is nice, McIlroy was quoted as said by the European Tour website.
A winning Sunday would be the perfect way for the old No. 1 McIlroy to prepare for the British Open, which begins next week at Royal Liverpool. He won the last of his two seniors in 2012.
“Everything was on,” McIlroy said. I controlled my ball flight very well, which is the key to me playing well in these conditions and in these courses.
I've been working the last 10 days to keep the ball down, hitting easy shots and taking spin off it, and I went out there today and really trusted what I practiced.
Last year Phil Mickelson used the Scottish Open at Castle Stuart as a springboard for his British Open title and his 68 leaves him very close to McIlroy.
Mickelson needs a jolt of confidence as Lefty has slipped out of the top 10 in the standings and hasn't finished in the top 10 on the PGA Tour this season.
I thought they were difficult conditions, Mickelson said in an audio interview posted on the European Tour website. I was surprised to see some low scores out there because it didn't seem like I was playing easy, and the wind was pretty strong.
I felt like I was playing well and having a good day at putting. It was a good day.

"One of the most important lessons you should learn is when you drink, you shouldn't drive. I learned this the hard way. Last year, I got a DUI, which means driving under influence. If you're stopped and smell of alcohol, the police will ask you to take an alcohol test. When you do the test, you have to blow really hard on a machine, which then will tell you if you are over the limit to drive a vehicle. The limit is usually.08 volume of alcohol in the blood. So, if you go through that, you're going to jail.

Even if you don't go to jail for a long time, you'll be suffering the consequences of your mistake for a long time. Here is a list of things you will have to do if you get a DUI: go to court, go to alcohol education classes, go to Alcoholics Anonymous, pay a lot of money in fines. If you don't want to pay, you'll have to do community service. I have my DUI almost two years ago, and I'm still suffering the consequences. I still have 56 hours for community service.
I have to update my insurance policy, and deal with the Department of Motor Vehicles. You're wasting a lot of time and money. It's hard to get a job, because you have to let your future employer know you've been arrested. It's not worth it. If you're thinking about going out and celebrating with friends and family, do one of the following things: get a designated driver, take the bus or train, or call a taxi. It may cost you a little money, but compared to how much money you'll lose if you get a DUI, it's nothing. Don't drink and drive.",B1
"No. 1 State of Florida resurfaced in the second half and gathered to defeat No. 2 Auburn 34-31 at the BCS National Championship college football match Monday in Pasadena, California.
The Seminoles -LRB- 13-0 -RRB- outperformed the Tigers -LRB- 12-2 -RRB- 24-10 after half-time to win their third national title. It was the second BCS crown of the FSU and the third national title.
Heisman Trophy and FSU quarterback Jameis Winston were 20 by 35 for 237 yards and two touchdowns, including Kelvin Benjamin's winner with 13 seconds left.
Bigger pictures of the championship game
The fourth quarter became a round-trip affair. The last 24 points of the game were scored in the last 4:42 of the game.
The Tigers seemed to be on the verge of their second title in four seasons when Tre Mason scored a touchdown ahead in a certain 37-yard scammer with 1:19 remaining in the game.
But led by Winston, the Seminoles drove 80 yards into seven moves to grab the crown.
Who will win next year's championship?
The FSU rally included Levonte Whitfield's return to 100 yards with 4:31 to put the state of Florida ahead. The extra point was 27-24.
Tigers take advantage in half time
After an early FSU field goal, Auburn scored three straight touchdowns to take a 21-3 lead.
But Devonta Freeman of the state of Florida scored in a 3 yard race with 1:28 left in the first half to reduce the deficit in the intermediate to 11. That FSU unit was kept alive by a quarter final-down out of point formation.
The only score in the third quarter was a 41-yard field goal by Roberto Aguayo, FSU kicker. He also made a 35-yarder in the first period.
FSU also obtained a fourth TD from Chad Abram at a reception of 11 yards with 10:55 remaining.
Final BCS game: Thanks for the memories
Auburn Kicker Cody Parkey's 22-yard field goal with 4:42 on the left made the score 24-20.
Auburn's quarterback, Nick Marshall, threw two touchdowns and ran for one. It was 14 times 27 times 216 yards and an interception. Mason ran 195 yards in 34 portas.
The game was the last championship contest under the current system, which featured the top two teams in the Bowl Championship Series survey. Next season, the top four teams will gather in a playoff where it will take two wins to win the title.

"Public schools are available to children from kindergarten to 12th grade free of charge. However, many families choose to pay for their children ' s primary and secondary education by sending them to private schools. There are many different types of private schools and many different reasons why parents send their children there. Some private schools are military schools and others are boarding schools where students live on campus. Some private schools are affiliated with a certain religion. These schools teach the beliefs and traditions of a specific faith, as well as regular academic subjects. There are schools run by Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Muslims and Orthodox Christians. There are also private schools specializing in the teaching of disabled students.

Some parents choose private schools because they feel they offer better education than public schools; others choose private schools because they offer a different kind of curriculum. Waldorf schools, for example, only allow children to play and use items made of natural materials.
Private schools are also called independent or non-State schools because they are not run by local, state or national governments. They can choose which students go to their schools. They do it through entrance exams and interviews. There is often an application for admission. Some private schools accept anyone who can pay tuition to send their children there. Some schools charge up to $45,000 a year. Private schools charge tuition because they do not receive money collected from local, state and national taxes. Some private schools offer a limited number of scholarships to help pay for the school. Many of these scholarships are based on needs, which means for students who cannot afford tuition. Other scholarships are offered for students with very good grades or for students who have a talent in a sport or art.",B1
"LRB-CNN-RRB-Feidin Santana, the man who recorded a South Carolina police officer fatally shooting a man who was fleeing, unarmed, told CNN on Thursday night that another cop told him to stop using his phone to capture the incident.
One of the officers told me to stop, but it was because I - LRB - told them -RRB - that what they did was an abuse and I witnessed everything, he told Anderson Cooper 360 of CNN.
Santana told Cooper to wait where he was, but he finally left the scene to go to work.
In other interviews, Santana has said she feared for her life, which almost prevented her from revealing the recording.
Santana recalled the moments in which she recorded a video of approximately three minutes of North Charleston police officer Michael Slager shooting Walter Scott as Scott escaped on Saturday. That evidence led the officer to shoot and arrest on a murder charge.
Santana said that when she first appeared on the scene as she walked towards her work she saw Slager on top of Scott, who was on the floor. I could hear the sound of a Taser in use.
At no time did Santana see Scott go after the Taser. He thinks Scott was trying to escape.
Mr. Scott never tried to fight, Santana told CNN.
Police said Slager used a Taser against Scott, but Slager would also later tell a dispatcher that Scott had at some point taken the Taser.
After Slager shot Scott five times, the officer picked something up again.
Santana thinks it was the Taser but she said she wasn't 100% sure of what it was.
Neither the fight nor the use of a Taser were captured on video, because Santana had not yet started recording.
What we know about Officer Slager
The video of the cell phone, which Santana revealed this week, revived the national protests around the police treatment of African Americans and led to a murder charge against Slager, who is white. Scott was black.
Police said Slager arrested the 50-year-old Scott for a brake light that didn't work Saturday morning. Scott, according to a video from the camera, fled Slager for unexplained reasons, and the officer chased him on foot.
When Santana's video starts, Scott starts running away from the officer, with Scott back to Slager. The video shows Slager shooting Scott eight times before Scott falls.
Who was Walter Scott?
Scott's mother, Judy Scott, told Cooper this week that she would like to thank Santana for coming.
He was there. God planned it. “He is the ram in the bush... I really believe so,” Judy Scott said.
Santana agreed.
I think he was right, he said. God put me there for a reason.
Judy Scott said she couldn't watch the whole recording.
When I saw my son running and I saw the cop behind him, I couldn't stand it, he said. I had to turn around. I couldn't handle it.
In an interview with Matt Lauer of the NBC, Santana suggested that she was giving interviews to the media in part to protect herself from retaliation.
At some point I thought of remaining anonymous, and not showing my face, not talking about it. “But... if I didn’t show my face, everyone there knows, including the police, who I am,” Santana said.
Santana didn't say if she had received threats.
His lawyer, Todd Rutherford, said that Santana's video would be useful in an investigation, not only of the shooting, but also of whether Scott received prompt medical attention.
In the last half of the video, a second officer seems to examine Scott with his hands tied together.
Video of witnesses, official accounts raise questions
Santana said that after she stopped recording, she watched for a few more minutes, but never saw anyone perform CPR.
A police report says that a third officer, not shown in the video, reported seeing an officer administering first aid, and that the third officer approached and helped that person with first aid and CPR.
On Wednesday, he asked if the CPR took place in Scott, North Charleston police chief Eddie Driggers said: In the end - LRB- the video -RRB-, what I saw was -LRB- what I -RRB- believed was a police officer who took off the individual's shirt and performed some kind of life-saving procedure - LRB-RRB-, but I'm not sure what happened there.

"America is a country that has people from all over the world. Not only do many people speak different languages, many people practice different religions. Most people in the United States identify themselves as Christians, but only half of them regularly attend church. The second most popular religion is Judaism. The third most common religion in the United States is Islam. Other religions practiced in the United States include Hinduism and Buddhism. About 20 percent of all people in the U.S. They say they don't practice any religion. One of the founding principles of the United States is religious freedom, which means that people can practice whatever religion they want without being discriminated against. This is guaranteed even in the United States Constitution. This is one of the reasons why the United States has no official religion.

Because there are so many different religions in the United States, there are many different types of houses of worship. Christians attend churches. Jews and Hindus attend temples. Muslims attend mosques. Many people use what they use to reflect their religious beliefs. For example, some Islamic women wear a scarf called ""hijab"" to cover their heads. It is disrespectful to ask a Muslim woman to remove her hijab or to ask her to show him what is underneath it. Male followers of an Indian religion called ""Sikhism"" usually wear cotton turbans. Again, it's wrong to take off a person's turban or ask him to take it off. The male followers of Hasidism, a branch of Judaism, have long curls on their heads. They wear a prayer shawl with fringes. Other Jewish men may wear a small cap on their heads called yarmulke. This is supposed to be a constant reminder that God is above them.",B1
"In her neat and classic white shirt uniform, Carolina Herrera exudes the kind of elegance and easy grace that has defined her fashion label for over 30 years.
It is a look that has been sought by some of the world's leading ladies, from the Jackie Onassis style icon to actress Renee Zellweger and comedian Tina Fey, who came out with a Herrera dress at this year's Oscars.
Herrera's rise to the top of the fashion world began in 1981, when he launched his Carolina Herrera flagship brand in New York.
Today, its empire encompasses the firm's fashion collection, a nuptial collection, fragrances and accessories. Herrera has more than 280 stores in 104 countries and all this brings billions of dollars.
Herrera says she was more interested in horses than in fashion when she grew up in Caracas, Venezuela, where father here was governor. But he adds that he was lucky to always be surrounded by exquisitely dressed women. Today, women in her life include her four daughters, two of whom also work for the Carolina Herrera brand.
Here, Herrera talks exclusively to CNN about style, business, family and getting ahead in a man's world.
About the construction of a business...
- LRB- Fashion is -RRB- a very difficult business, as you know, because fashion is a business. If you don't sell, then you're not in business.
You may be the best designer and you are so creative and new, you have the most beautiful ideas, but if everyone stays in your room and doesn't go out to be used by someone, then you're not in business.
The hardest thing - LRB- part -RRB- of this business is to have the right equipment, because I - LRB- couldn't have done -RRB- everything I've done alone.
If I - LRB- didn't have -RRB- my teams behind me, I wouldn't be sitting here. Fashion is a collaboration with many people.

On Herrera's team...
I have a team, a fantastic president who takes care of the company's numbers. If you ask me to take care of that side, I'd be sitting there crying because I don't know what to do. If I asked him to design clothes, I wouldn't know how to do it. But I always tell young designers to separate the creative side from the business side. You have to have someone very capable of running the side of the business. Because then, you succeed.
In style...
The style is so different in everyone. But one style is something you do that is totally different from the other or something you're using that's the same as the other person, but it looks different in you. It's a special touch. Some people have it and some people don't.
About juggling at work and family life...
Women managed to do a lot of things at the same time. Men, no. Men do one thing at a time. I see my husband say why are you doing all this at the same time? You're gonna do something wrong here.
I say, no. Because women, we're capable of doing that. Because we have children; we have to work sometimes; we have a house; we have a husband and everything works. It's a question of organization.
More of the top women: Women! Embrace your inner nerd
At the Carolina Herrera brand...
I think that women in Carolina Herrera... I like that they are sophisticated and I like that they are classic with a modern twist.
You can be dressed by Carolina Herrera New York, but you can have CH accessories and it's like a lifestyle.
Dressing up for your age and figure...
It's about finding the style for the right figure or the right age. Sometimes you see women who don't realize that age is changing your style, and they don't change.
What you wore when you were 15 doesn't look so good when you're 30 and it certainly looks terrible when you're older. So, you have to change with the times. It is the same with a more complete figure or a very thin one.
In the white blouse...
The white shirt is one of the easiest things to wear, because it can be worn with jeans or worn with a ball dress. I mean with a ball skirt. It's so easy.
It's like a safety blanket to me. When I don't know what to wear, I say a white blouse. You can take your own look.

In the egos of fashion...
You have to deal with the egos of fashion. You know, there's a lot. It should not be treated so seriously because fashion is just making dresses to make women look beautiful. We're not inventing anything new.
Because of your inspiration...
Inspiration comes from things you've seen all your life. Sometimes you see collections that are inspired by the 20s and 30s and the 40s and 50s. That means that fashion is a repetition of ideas. It's the way you put it together that makes it modern...
In his management style...
I don't think I like going around screaming. I don't believe in this. I think you have to treat people who work with you like your family.
On advice to fashion women...
First of all, you have to love him. Secondly, you have to remember that it's not going to be easy. You're in a lot of trouble. You have to have perseverance. You have to do it even if it doesn't work and you have to move on. You have to be strong about it. They have to have the talent to do it, because without talent, how can you make fashion?

"Two years ago, Amy left her small hometown in England and moved to one of the largest cities in the United States, New York. Amy knew the transition would be difficult at first, but she was confident that she would love her new life and become a Broadway star. She had imagined herself getting off the plane and immediately making new friends with whom she would spend her nights exploring The city that never sleeps.

Unfortunately, the reality of Amy's situation was far from the perfect life she had imagined. His days were spent jumping from the theater to the theater looking for auditions. Although she was very pretty, and very good at acting, her accent made it difficult for her to be hired for any role. The directors kept telling him to work on his American accent, but the more he practiced it, the more he looked like a cowboy instead of a New Yorker.
Amy's nights were spent working in a restaurant to pay for her ridiculously expensive one-bedroom apartment where the washbasins always dripped and the hot water never worked. To top it off, the city I had imagined filled with bright lights and friendly faces as in the movies was composed mainly of stinky alleys, big rats and angry crowds who were always in a hurry to get somewhere. Still, Amy didn't let anything crush her spirit, and she was determined to keep working hard until her dreams came true.
Eventually one day, Amy was cleaning some tables at the restaurant while singing her favorite song as usual. ""Excuse me,"" one man said in a nearby booth. ""I couldn't help but notice that you have a beautiful voice."" Amy blushed and thanked the man. ""I'm actually casting for a star in my new Mary Poppins Broadway musical,"" he continued. ""How would you feel about acting?"" Amy's heart accelerated with emotion just as Frank Sinatra ""New York, New York"" began playing at the restaurant's rocola. I was finally gonna make it.

"Food trucks used to be somewhere fast to get food for office workers in cities across the United States. Food used to be average, certainly nothing to brag about. Food trucks were a matter of convenience, and generally offered cheap meals. At lunchtime in cities across the United States, workers lined up to order a sandwich and canned soda. Food rarely costs more than five dollars. They took their food and ate as they walked. Some workers took their food to their offices and ate in the company's dining room or at their desks.

The food trucks have come a long way. They are no longer considered just fast food on wheels. Food trucks are now considered a gourmet gastronomic experience. There are food trucks that sell kitchens from all over the world. There are Korean barbecue food trucks and food trucks that sell lobster rolls. There are even food trucks that specialize in desserts. These dessert food trucks sell more than just ice cream cones. They sell cakes and cakes. There's even cupcake trucks.
Food trucks have become so popular that many use social media to reach customers and create a fan base. Some food trucks use Twitter to inform customers about their day menu. Other food trucks use Facebook to inform customers at which corner they will be parked.
These clean food trucks, with their gourmet food and great fan base, however, are no longer a bargain. You can rarely get a meal from a food truck for less than ten dollars. Some people think the price is worth the quality. Others only bring home sandwiches.

"It was a beautiful summer night and I decided to go swimming at Doolin Pier in Clare County, Ireland, where I moved in 2012. There was a woman in the water with Dusty, a dolphin who has a great relationship with a group of people with whom nothing regularly.
Dusty arrived in Doolin around 2008 and hundreds of people have been swimming with her since then, giving the impression that she is totally tamed. She has even starred in an advertising campaign on the Irish tourist board where a girl says she would like to touch a dolphin.
That night, this woman tickled Dusty's belly and looked so attractive. There were about 20 tourists and locals on the dock, watching this beautiful show. Just after I got into the water, Dusty left the woman she was with and got ballistic – I found out after she was very territorial when she was with someone. Her tail was flapping wildly and, at first, I thought it was an exhibition, but then I twisted: maybe she's angry. I knew I had to get out of the water so I was swimming towards the dock but, in microseconds, Dusty had ploughed me with his snout. It was very powerful and painful, and the speed was incredible. I went forward.
All these people on the dock were looking at me with their mouths open. Dusty was still in the water next to me, his tail flapping madly. That was more frightening than anything: I thought, if she hit me with the tail, I could go down; I was gone.
I was at the dock, but I couldn't get out because of my wounds. I felt pure terror. I screamed for help and a guy put his arm in my arm and pulled me out on the steps. Then another man appeared and said he was an orthopedic surgeon who specialized in marine trauma. He had been driving to Doolin when he saw what was going on at the dock. I was so cold and so worried – I didn't know how bad my wounds were and my biggest fear was internal bleeding. He looked at me and it was very reassuring, saying he couldn't feel any evidence of it, but he probably had broken bones. I later learned that I had six spinal fractures, three broken ribs, and one damaged lung.
I was in the hospital for five days, on a back brace for several weeks and out of work for five months with limited mobility, stiffness and pain. Then I was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. My near-death experience had left me anxious about everything and overreacted in a way I had never done before. I felt that people looked at me the wrong way, I started fighting loud noises and suffered from memory loss. Three months before the accident, I had opened a health food store, but I had to let it go because I couldn't work anymore. It was the hardest year ever, but now, everything's behind me. I had craniosacral therapy, osteopathy and massage, and I'm building my own osteopathy practice now. I have a new empathy with patients because I've been one.
I'm grateful that I'm healthy and I really want to keep other people from getting hurt. We have this lovely idea about dolphins and we have faith in them – who would think a dolphin could attack a person? If you see a ferocious animal coming at you with bare teeth, it's scary, but dolphins have this beautiful, broad smile.
I don't have any anger at Dusty. I respect her. But I was on her turf and she's a wild, unpredictable animal. People need to know that. Many come here to swim with her and don't understand how dangerous she can be. My injuries were reportedly several of the injuries that occurred that summer.
After the man pulled me out of the water, Dusty swam, but then she came back and was floating vertically beside me, looking at me. We closed our eyes and felt that there was complete remorse in her. She was a completely different dolphin; the anger was gone. The people on the dock were amazed. When he had that little moment with me, that was the end of terror. I made peace with her.",B1
"On the market square in Rjukan is a statue of the city's founder, a notable Norwegian engineer and industrialist named Sam Eyde. The great man looks north through the square on an almost pure hillside of the mountain in front of him.
Behind it, to the south, rises the equally pure peak of 1,800 meters known as Gaustatoppen. Between the mountains, along the narrow Vestfjord valley, is the small, but once powerful, city that Eyde built in the early years of the last century, to house the workers for their factories.
Eyde took advantage of the power of the 100-meter Rjukanfossen waterfall to generate hydroelectric power in what was, at the time, the world's largest power plant.
But one thing I couldn't do was change the rise of the sun. Deep in its east-west valley, surrounded by high mountains, Rjukan and its 3,400 inhabitants are in the shade for the middle of the year. During the day, from late September to mid-March, the city, three hours northwest of Oslo, is not completely dark, but certainly not bright.
However, recently the statue of Eyde has looked out to a view that even he may have found surprising. At the top of the mountain, 450 meters above the city, three large mirrors with computer-controlled solar energy constantly follow the movement of the sun through the sky, reflecting its rays towards the square and bathing it with bright sunlight.
It's the sun! Ingrid Sparbo screams, disbeliefing, raising his face to the light and closing his eyes. A retired secretary, Sparbo, has lived her whole life in Rjukan and says that people “get used to the shadow. You end up without thinking about it, really. But this... this is so warm. Not just physically, but mentally. It’s getting mentally warm.”
Two young mothers take their children to the square and stand in the sun. On an icy day, a couple of elders sit on one of the new benches, smiling at the heat on their faces. The lightning of the children. A lot of people take pictures. A shop assistant, Silje Johansen, says it is “incredible. Just awesome.”
Pushing his son's buggy, electric engineer Eivind Toreid is more cautious. “It’s a funny thing,” he says. “It’s not real sunlight, but he likes it a lot. As a center of attention.”
Heidi Fieldheim says he heard everything on the radio. “But it’s much more than I expected,” he says. This will bring a lot of happiness.
On the other side of the road, in the Nye Tider café, the man responsible for this unexpected access to happiness sits. Martin Andersen is a 40-year-old artist who moved to Rjukan in the summer of 2001.
The first impression of a work of art Andersen called the Solspeil, or mirror of the sun, came to him as the month of September began to fade: “Every day, we would take our little boy for a walk in the buggy,” he says, “and, every day, I realized that we were having to go a little further down the valley to find the sun.” By September 28, the sun completely disappears from the market square in Rjukan. It does not reappear until 12 March.
Over the months that seemed endless, Andersen says: “We looked up and saw the blue sky above, and the high sun on the slopes of the mountains, but the only way to get there was to get out of the city. It’s sad, a people that people have to leave to feel the sun.”
Twelve years later he first dreamed of his Solspeil, a German company specializing in the so-called CSP – concentrated solar energy – by helicopter in the three 17-square-meter glass mirrors that are now above the market square in Rjukan. “It was taken,” he says, “a little more than we had imagined.”
It really works. There were objectors – and many of them – petitions and letter writing campaigns and an organized Facebook page against what a large number of locals initially considered a project of vanity and, above all, a waste of money. But even now they seem largely conquered.
“I was firmly against it,” admits Nils Eggerud. Like many others, he believed that the money could have been spent better elsewhere: on a couple of additional caregivers to take care of the elderly in Rjukan, perhaps, or on better school facilities, bicycle lanes, a little rural path that was resurfacing.
“And I still have my doubts about ongoing maintenance costs,” he says. What will they be, who will pay them? But... well, it feels good, standing here. And, in reality, you just have to look at people’s faces.”
In his office overlooking the square, the energetic young mayor of Rjukan, Steinar Bergsland, is interested not so much in the cost, but in the benefits that mirrors could bring to the city.
Already, says Bergsland, the number of visitors has increased during the time of the year and the shopkeepers of Rjukan have reported their shots following the example. A high-tech company is interested in moving to Rjukan, attracted by state-of-the-art technology at the top of the mountain and the advertising it has attracted.
“This is a powerful symbol for Rjukan,” says Bergsland, and, aided by various government grants and a donation from a local business, the city needed to find only 1 million crowns – 100,000 pounds – of the total cost of 5 million crowns of mirrors.
And, seen against the city’s annual budget of 650 million kroner, he says, 1 million kroner wasn’t really much to pay for something that “gives us a much, much better opportunity to raise the money we need for better schools and more nursing care. And look out the window. Look at those happy faces. Now it’s here, people love it.”

"Charles Lindbergh is an American hero, who took the nation, and the world by storm as a 25-year-old pilot in 1927. That was the year Lindbergh flew from New York to Paris across the Atlantic Ocean alone. Aviation technology was not very advanced during that period. The Lindbergh plane The Spirit of St.Louis was believed by many simply too small to make the solo flight across the great Atlantic. Bringing enough fuel for the flight was a challenge, and so was the journey itself. Because of the speed limitations of the aircraft at that time, it would take many hours to make the trip; it was generally accepted that a pilot could not do it alone. Lindbergh would not be deterred however.

Lindbergh was working as a mail pilot when he decided to make his flight across the Atlantic. Six well-known and trained airmen had lost their lives trying to make the flight before him, so his chances of success were not in his favor. On the morning of May 20, 1927, Lindbergh launched his small plane from Roosevelt Field in New York, and decided to arrive in Paris. The flight was an international event as Lindbergh's progress was reported by reporting stations during his flight. Lindbergh faced many dangers and challenges during his flight, including bad weather, and flying blind through the thick fog. He also had to fight his fatigue during the almost 54-hour flight.
It was all worth it when Lindbergh landed in Paris on Saturday, May 21, 1927 at night. More than 150,000 French citizens had gathered to join the celebration of their historic flight. Lindbergh had become an international superstar literally overnight. He returned home with an American public worshiper celebrating his fame with a parade through the streets of New York City.",B1

Subject: Electric problem on Acacia Avenue 32
Dear Sam,
I'm writing on behalf of myself and my roommates on 32nd Acacia Avenue since we've been having problems with electricity.
We realized that if we use more than one device at night when the lights are on, the power is cut. This means that we cannot use the dishwasher at the same time as the oven, for example. For a while we have been careful, but recently we have discovered that even during the day, more than one operating machine can cause a power outage. Occasionally, energy is cut for no obvious reason.
We know that the electrician who came before couldn't find anything wrong, but please, can someone come back as the problem is getting worse? If it's easier, we can fix an electrician ourselves and send him the bill.
Nice greeting,

"Many young Americans dream of becoming a rock star at one time or another in their lives. American culture is largely defined by the music enjoyed by young people. During the 1960s, music in the United States was heavily influenced by the social problems of the time. Many call the decade a revolutionary period in the history of the country, and music was a big part of that revolution.

When David was young, he was in love with the Beatles. The English band was possibly the most striking group of the generation. He revolutionized music like no band or artist before them. Most young boys wanted to be Paul McCartney, or John Lennon - the band's two founders. Getting rich and famous in America is one of the attractions of living in America, and becoming a rock star is one way to achieve it. David knew this, so he met with three of his friends and convinced them to form a band together.
Many American Rock ‘N’ Roll bands began their journey in someone’s garage. A notable group to start this way was Van Halen. David and his friends were convinced that they could become the next Beatles with a little luck and a lot of practice.
The band practiced regularly over the years, and soon became good enough to perform in front of some young audience, but it never reached the big hour unfortunately. The road to success in the music industry is not easy to travel, but that does not deter some American dreamers. David's philosophy was ""You never know what the future holds,"" and he is dedicated to the music industry to this day. A couple of their original band members are also in the industry enjoying marginal success, and they are still pursuing their dream.",B1
"Good people, not to mention good tips, exist. Christina Summit knows for sure now after what happened on Saturday night.
The fingerprint tattoo on Summit's wrist often leads to conversations with strangers about her love for animals; she volunteers with a pit bull rescue group and spends a lot of time finding homes for animals of all kinds.
While taking care of a bar at the Holiday Inn in Clinton, New Jersey, Summit had to chat with a friendly couple before the night was taken care of. The man asked her if she had any dogs of her own; he trusted that her baby, a Great Dane-black Labrador mixture called Tucker, was in the veterinary hospital after having had emergency surgery hours before she swallowed a hard plastic ball. I was worried about him.
The man said something about the surgery being expensive. She trusted that the estimate was about $2,700, but she would do what she had to do for the dog, whom she adopted in 2011. Summitt, 37, works three jobs: full-time as a chef at the hotel, on Saturdays as a bartender, and as a food preparation worker two days a week at a delicatessen store in his city. Her husband works full-time and Summit has three stepchildren.
The couple ordered drinks and dinner at the bar. When the time came to close his $80 account, the man filled the receipt with a tip... for $1,000.
Summitt said he started shaking and crying. She showed the bill to her sister, who handles bar with her, to make sure she was seeing three zeros after 1.
I came back and said, sir, I can't accept this, why is this, why would I do this? She said. He told him to put it on Tucker's medical costs.
I just stood there in shock. I walked and hugged this couple. They said, ""We'll pray for Tucker.""
Hotel manager Michelle Satanik told CNN that she went on with her supervisor and also located the client this week to verify that the gesture was legitimate. CNN has tried to contact the generous informant through Summit, who kept his name anonymous for his privacy.
Apparently this man does this quite often. “A very kind and humanitarian guy,” Satanik said. I've never seen a $1,000 tip like that.
Summit shared the story on Facebook and CNN iReport with a credit card photo and a photo of Tucker being held by his 16-year-old stepson before the dog was left in the hospital for surgery. A Facebook page that follows is called Why Waiters and Servants Hate People republished the story on Easter Sunday with this title: This is a place for us to vent, but from time to time, especially on holidays, we have to be grateful for the incredible customers out there.
Summit says it has received messages of support from all over the world.
I would also love nothing more than to thank this couple publicly in front of the world. I've never seen a random act give so much hope to so many people, he wrote.
Tucker's recovering at home.

"Phil Jackson is an American basketball coach and general manager. He used to be a basketball player, and played for several seasons at the National Basketball Association during the 1970s. He played for the New York Knicks for most of his career after being recruited by the team in 1967. He was one of the best reserve players for the Knicks team that won the NBA Championship in 1973. Due to a spinal injury, he did not continue playing for the team. Jackson was an average player, who found some success in the NBA, but his phenomenal success in the league came as a coach.

As a Chicago Bulls coach, Jackson's teams won six titles in nine years. He was hired in 1987 by the Bulls as assistant coach, and took over as head coach in 1989. Helping him win the titles was Michael Jordan. Jordan is one of the most successful athletes in playing basketball. Many people claim that Jackson was able to win his six titles because of Jordan, while others point out that Jordan preceded Jackson without ever winning a title. In any case, the duo worked, and the rest is NBA history.
Jackson joined Los Angeles Lakers as a coach in 2000. The Lakers were in a situation similar to that of the Bulls during that time. The team was very talented, but lacked leadership. Jackson, one more time, whenever. During their time with the Lakers, Jackson's teams won five NBA titles, almost matching the Bulls race.

"For many years, gambling in the United States was legal only in the state of Nevada. Nevada is a western state in eastern California, south of Oregon and Idaho, west of Utah, and north of Arizona. It's a desert state where little rain falls during the year. It is just over 275 miles from the city of Los Angeles, where most of its visitors come from. Driving from Los Angeles is about four hours. Las Vegas, meaning the Meadows in Spanish, was established by Mexicans in the mid-1800s. Much of what is now the southwest part of the United States was then part of the Mexican Empire. The city was a railway town established in 1905, and the first legal casino appeared in 1931.

Las Vegas is now a gambling city, where people from all over the United States come on vacation. Its population is less than 2,000,000, making it the 30th largest city in the country. Its original population in 1905 was only 5,000. Much of the city's growth is due to the gambling industry. Many states have legalized the game since then, including New Jersey, and California, but Las Vegas is still No. 1 tourist city for players in the USA Today some of its largest and most beautiful hotels include Bellagio, Flamingo, Caesars Palace, Treasure Island, Mandalay Bay, and Wynn. These hotels are on Las Vegas Boulevard, which is commonly called ""The Strip."" With its almost all year sun, beautiful casinos and variety of game options, Las Vegas remains the best place to play in the United States.

"Health insurance is a way to pay for medical care. Medical care includes doctor visits, prescription drugs, and emergency services. People can pay for medicine and medical visits directly in cash or they can use health insurance. Health insurance usually means you pay less for these services. There are different types of health insurance. In some jobs, companies offer health insurance schemes as part of a benefit package. People can also buy health insurance. Elderly and disabled people can obtain government-managed health insurance through programs such as Medicaid and Medicare. There are many health insurance companies or different plans. Each health plan has a set of doctors with whom they work. Once a person chooses a plan, he pays a premium, which is a fixed amount of money every month. Once in a plan, a person chooses a doctor who wants to see from that plan. That doctor is the person's primary care provider.

Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act, is a recently passed law that makes it easier for people to get health insurance. The law requires all Americans to have health insurance by 2014. Those who do not receive health insurance by the end of the year will have to pay a fine in the form of an additional tax when they file their income taxes. Through Obamacare, people can still get insurance through their jobs, in private, or through Medicaid and Medicare. They can also buy health insurance through state markets, where people can get help choosing a plan based on their income and health care needs. These markets also create an easy way to compare what different plans offer. If people cannot afford to buy health insurance, they can qualify for government programs that offer free health insurance such as Medicaid, Medicare, or for children, a special program called the Child Health Insurance Program (CHIP).",B1
"Digital Games and Learning Guide
How can games unlock a rich learning world? This is the big question at the heart of the growing ‘games and learning’

We're on. We wanted to create a dynamic and in-depth guide that would respond to many of the
the most pressing questions that lifelong educators, parents and students have
posed – questions about the use of digital games for learning. While we had
educators in mind in developing this guide, any student of a lifetime can use it for

We urge you to read it. Start with the introduction that provides an overview of games in the classroom. Then go straight to
the second section that presents how research on digital games is evolving and talks about how
pediatricians, academics, educators and researchers are working to find answers to how games and technology affect
students of all ages. The third section, on “How to start using digital games for learning”, provides examples of how some

"An evacuation order was lifted Wednesday morning for more than 500 California homes on slopes vulnerable to mud slides, authorities said.
With the sun shining on much of Los Angeles, officials told people living in the foothills of La Crescenta, La Canada Flintridge and Acton that they could return home at 8 a.m. PT - LRB- 11 a.m. ET-RRB-.
Officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for these residents on Tuesday morning as a precaution when heavy rains were predicted.
The dangerous mudslides did not develop, but this area was particularly hit after one Saturday of downpour unleashed a mud river that damaged dozens of homes.
Several of the houses were declared uninhabitable.
A massive fire in the National Forest of Angels last summer burned down the slopes where these houses are located.

"People's ""class"" is usually defined by how much money they make. In the United States there are usually three classes: poor, middle class and rich. Some people also think that there is another class between the poor class and the middle class called the working class. The culture of the United States is based on the idea that people can climb the economic ladder and become middle class or even rich if they were born poor. This is the idea of moving from ""rapes to riches."" Going up the class ladder isn't easy. The higher education needed to achieve good paid work is expensive.

Class in the United States is more than just how much money a person makes though. Education, the work a person has, where he lives and culture, all play a role in the class in which a person will be classified. For example, a person with only one high school diploma and low-paying service work can be considered poor or low-class. While a person with a doctorate, who owns his own company, would be considered high class or rich. In a way, this makes sense because well-paid jobs often require high-level education. But for some people, class is something you're born with. For example, the children of billionaire Donald Trump were born rich and high-class without having done anything to earn that status.
Gender also plays a role in how someone can ascend on the economic scale. Women earn less than men, making it harder for them to accumulate wealth. Race also plays a role in how much people earn and their ability to ascend on the economic scale. In the United States, most families require both men and women to work to maintain the home.",B1
"NASA will launch the Endeavour Space Shuttle on February 7, which will be the first of five launches this year before the ferry fleet withdraws.
Endeavour will fly from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on a 13-day mission to the international space station.
The mission will include three space walks, NASA said. The shuttle will also deliver the final part of the space station in the US. This portion will provide more space for crew members.
NASA plans to withdraw its Discovery, Endeavour and Atlantis space shuttles by the end of this year.
The space agency has been looking for places, like museums, to house the shuttles after they're retired.
The Discovery Space Shuttle will be transferred to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington.
The privilege of showing a shuttle isn't cheap... about $29 million, NASA said.

"If you think about the jobs robots could never do, you'd probably put doctors and teachers at the top of the list. It is easy to imagine robot cleaners and factory workers, but some jobs need human connection and creativity. But are we underestimating what robots can do? In some cases, they already work better than doctors in diagnosing the disease. In addition, some patients may feel more comfortable sharing personal information with a machine than a person. Could there be a place for robots in education after all?
British education expert Anthony Seldon believes it. And it even has a date for the robot taking of the classroom: 2027. He predicts that robots will do the main job of transferring information and teachers will be as assistants. Smart robots will read students' faces, their movements, and even brain signals. Then they will adapt the information to each student. It is not a popular opinion and robots are unlikely to have empathy and the ability to really connect with humans as another human can.
One thing's for sure, though. A robot teacher is better than any teacher at all. In some parts of the world, there are not enough teachers and between 9 and 16 per cent of children under the age of 14 do not go to school. That problem could be partially solved by robots because they can teach anywhere and don't stress, or tired, or move somewhere for easier and better paid work.
Those negative aspects of teaching are something everyone agrees on. Teachers all over the world leave because it's hard work and they feel overworked. Maybe the question isn't 'Will robots replace teachers?' But how can robots help teachers? Office employees can use software to do things like organizing and responding to emails, organizing meetings, and updating calendars. Teachers waste a lot of time doing non-teaching work, including more than 11 hours a week marking homework. If robots could reduce the time teachers spend by marking homework and writing reports, teachers would have more time and energy for parts of work than humans do better.",B1

Great network, pity for chips
He came to have lunch with my sister. We loved our main Thai style which were amazing with a lot of flavor, very impressive for a vegetarian restaurant.
But the service was below average and the chips were too terrible to end.
When we reached 1.40, we had to wait 20 minutes while they were preparing our table. Okay, so we didn't have a reservation, but the restaurant was half full. There was no reason to keep us waiting.
We ordered the fries as a side dish and they looked delicious. But when we tried them, they were overcooked and they swam in oil, so we left most of them. We're expecting a lot more for $10!
When the waiter asked if everything was all right, we said we really didn't like chips and said, ""That's funny, I love them,"" and that was it. He didn't offer us anything else and he didn't take them out of our account. Besides, when we didn't tip, he seemed upset.
I was very excited to visit Vega, and the main ones were fantastic, but the rest of the experience was really disappointing.",B1
"December is really a special time. People start putting their Christmas decorations and lights out of their homes. Christmas is wonderful, because family members come from far away to visit. We eat, drink and talk about how our lives are going. One of my favorite things when my family comes to visit is to go for a walk in my father's car and see all the houses with their Christmas lights on.

Last year, my father told us that he had seen a neighborhood with the whole block full of houses with lights. We decided to go see them. The whole family piled up in two cars. We drove about 40 minutes. When we got there, our faces lit up with joy when we saw all the lights. My cousins decided they wanted to go out and see the lights. We all went out and started walking, but when it was time to get home, we didn't realize my younger brother wasn't in the car.
He had separated from the family, and in the end went to see a house. No one noticed, and we left it there for an hour. He called the house he went to see, and told the people who lived there what had happened. He knew my cell number, and so he called me. We were just about to get home when I got the call. I told my father, and he almost crashed the car, because he got really scared.
We left everyone and I decided to go with my father to pick up my brother. When we arrived at the house, my brother was sitting on the couch watching TV with the children who lived there and drinking hot chocolate. My father hugged him and said he was sorry. The people who lived there said it was okay for their children to like my brother because he was funny. They said I could come back any minute. I was relieved that nothing had happened to my brother.",B1
"Living in Southern California has its advantages. One of those advantages is to live so close to the mighty Pacific Ocean. It's the biggest ocean in the world... big, blue and beautiful. One of my favorite hobbies when I was growing up was taking a long trip down the Pacific coast road. It is a beautiful walk, winding in and out of the sea view, and climbing hills and down coastal valleys. For the first time cruises, it could be awesome.

On a lazy Saturday, I was a little bored, so I called my girlfriend, who was studying for her English exam next Monday, to see if she wanted to go for a walk. ""Hey Sheila, you want to go on a cruise?"" She crouched and slept for a while before she finally agreed to go with me. ""Where are we going?"" He asked, but he wanted it to be a surprise. She had been hitting the books pretty hard lately because of her upcoming midterm exams. I thought I needed a break, and so did I.
We started driving. Soon we were going through the Santa Monica tunnel. This tunnel is especially nice. When you enter it, you have no idea what he's waiting for at the other end. As soon as the exit reaches sight, the ocean, in all its glory, appears right before its eyes. Sheila was instantly delighted. He turned to me after a while and said, ""Thank you, honey. I really needed this."" I said, ""Me too, baby.""
We talked for hours. After that we went up and down, left and right, with the ocean as our companion. We ended up in Santa Barbara, a coastal town about 140 miles north of Los Angeles. It was getting late, so we decided to stay tonight. Santa Barbara is a university city, so it is easy to find affordable rooms to spend the night. That was one of the best nights of my young life.",B1
"It's never too late to learn. Emily Johnson had turned thirty when she decided to return to college to finish her career. It had been ten years since he last attended East Los Angeles College. It had been her dream to finish her two years at ELAC and move to Cal State L.A. Emily was unable to finish because she started working. Even though Emily found a good job, she still had the urge to complete her education. After all, what kind of example would he be giving to his daughters by not receiving their degree? Emily wanted her kids to succeed by going to college and having a better career than she had.

Emily was aware of the difficulties of going to school while working and caring for two daughters. The challenge was prepared and accepted. She went to work during the day, and went to class at night after taking her daughters to her mother's house. Emily had to keep this routine for a year in order to transfer. Of course, it did, and it was accepted in Cal State L.A.
Emily's time at college was a little more tiring compared to community college. She had been studying sociology. The same challenges were presented again. Emily had only completed her general education classes at community college, and now the focus was on her topic of interest.

"Governments across Europe dream of finding a magic solution to rising unemployment. However, in the most affected parts of the EU, unemployment rates continue to rise and the rhetoric recently to shorten the unemployment queue.
Now, in a troubled corner of Italy, a mayor believes he has found a response to his city's chronic lack of work, although, instead of a solution, it seems to be more of an admission of defeat. Valter Piscedda, mayor of the centre-left of Elmas, a small town near the capital of Sardinia, Cagliari, wants to pay residents to leave. The council will pay ten local unemployed to take intensive English classes, board a cheap flight and seek employment elsewhere in Europe.
“This is, above all, an idea born of common sense and experience,” he told the Guardian. “During the last year and a half – especially in recent months – I have been receiving young people, almost every day, who are desperate for their job search. Some are looking here and asking for help to find him here. Others have tried everything and are so discouraged that they no longer want to stay and wait. And they want to go and acquire work experience abroad; life experience, too.
“So my reasoning was this: put everything in place that the board administration can put in place for those who want to gain experience abroad to be able to do so,” he said.
As the national economy continues to stagger, Sardinia, along with much of southern and central Italy, is struggling with high unemployment, with a general unemployment rate of 17.7% in the second quarter of 2014, according to the National Institute of Statistics of Italy, Istat. More than 54 per cent of persons under 25 are unemployed.
For the program Adesso Parto (now I'm leaving), the board of Elmas has allocated 12,000 euros per order of arrival to candidates between 18 and 50 years old. As long as they are unemployed and have lived in the city for three years, they are eligible. They do not have to pursue university studies and their annual income should not exceed 15,000 euros.
The idea of encouraging people to pick up sticks is delicate at a time when the floods of Italians – many of them brilliant young graduates – are leaving their country every year. But Piscedda, who belongs to Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s Democratic Party, denies that he is facilitating a brain drain and believes that the people he is sending can “come back and give me back 100 times what they were given.” More importantly, he wants the plan to give an advantage to those most in need.
“It’s a program for those who don’t have another resource; it’s the last chance room. It’s about allowing them the dignity of not having to ask a friend for money or imposing burdens on families that can’t do it,” he said.
In early 2014, he added, the council launched a scheme whereby companies received financial incentives to hire young Elmas workers. “We announced 20 of these posts,” he said. “We have 120 applications.”
In Elmas, the scheme has provoked mixed reactions. “The reality is that there is little work here,” Alessandro Macis said. “The opportunity to go abroad to learn about the workplace and experience other cultures can be very valuable. The son of a friend of mine who didn't study much has finished in London and is really finding his way. He started as a waiter. Now, he’s a cook and he’s learning English.”
Others were perplexed. “I heard about it, but I thought it was strange. If you have that money to pay for people to leave, why don’t you use that money to keep them here?” said Consuelo Melis, who works behind the bar in a local cafeteria. On Twitter, one of the many reactions was disbelief. “The admission of the state of defeat,” said Marco Patavino. “The institutions are raising the white flag,” said Carlo Mazzaggio.
Piscedda, however, is not discouraged, commenting to his online critics: “Probably, they are people who are not in need... Every day, I deal with people’s problems and I have to do something to try to solve them. These people, if they had an alternative, wouldn't be asking for help.
“The work I can create, as mayor, is temporary. I can clean a piazza. I can clean it up again. I can clean the streets. But these are all temporary things that give nothing beyond that little bit of money for a few months. I want to go beyond that.”

"As a young competitive gymnast, Melissa Stockwell's heart was filled with pride as she looked at the American flag and sang the national anthem before each meeting. When someone asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up, he said he wanted to join the army.
Stockwell's parents thought he was going through a phase, but joined the ROTC program while at the University of Colorado at Boulder. After graduating with a communication degree in 2002, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Transportation Corps.
At the age of 23, Stockwell deployed to Iraq in March 2004. Less than a month later, his life changed forever. It was part of a routine convoy passing through the centre of Baghdad when a big explosion broke out.
Think of the loudest noise you can imagine and our vehicle starts spinning, remember. The woman at the front shouts IED, IED, we have hit an IED!
Stockwell's left leg was gone. It sounds strange, but as soon as they told me I didn't have my leg, I knew I was gonna be okay, says the veteran. I had an almost peaceful feeling that, well, everything's gonna be okay. Life isn't over.
While recovering at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, Stockwell says he was inspired by other patients.
You see these other soldiers and these other veterans who are missing two members, three members, sometimes four members... and I looked at myself and I really thought I was one of the lucky ones and made the decision that I was going to live my life for those who couldn't.
Stockwell learned to walk with her new leg and be independent, but knew she wouldn't feel like herself until she returned to sports.
Luckily there are organizations out there that actually grab the injured veterans from their hospital rooms and take them out doing things they may have never done with two legs, he says.
Four months after his injury, he went skiing in Colorado. The experience gave him an incredible sense of freedom and opened up a world of new possibilities.
After spending a year at Walter Reed, the Purple Heart and Bronze Star received medically retired from the Army. Stockwell returned to school for a new prosthetic career at Century College in Minnesota.
You basically fit amputated with artificial limbs, he says. I didn't know the field existed until I needed a leg, but then I thought, well, that's great.
After moving to Minnesota, he joined his first competitive swimming team. A presentation on the Paralympic inspired her to fight for her country on a new battlefield.
He dreamed of going to the Olympics when he was younger, he says. And now it was almost like I had a second chance. So I decided to try the swimming sport. It was easy for me to swim. I didn't have to wear a prosthetic leg.
In 2008, Stockwell became Iraq's first war veteran to be elected to the US paralympic team. I felt that his life had reached the whole circle: it made me feel so, so alive.
Today, the 32-year-old veteran works as a certified prosthetic at Scheck and Siress in Chicago and runs a triathlon club that began with her friends Keri Schindler and Dan Tun two years ago. Dare2Tri provides adaptive equipment and trainers for athletes with disabilities.
Cancer survivor and amputee Hailey Danisewicz says that Dare2Tri has taught him that, my chances as a person are infinite and that I can do anything that puts my mind to.
In October Danisewicz took second place in the World Paratriathlon Championship in New Zealand. First place, for the third year in a row, was coach and mentor Melissa Stockwell.

"Oprah Winfrey is one of the most successful women in the history of the United States of America. Winfrey was born in a small Mississippi town in 1954 into a poor family. Now she's one of the richest people in the world, and the richest American blacks in the country. She was also named the richest African American of the 20th century. Winfrey is known by most Americans through her day program called ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"". His program is very popular with viewers because he likes to address the difficult problems that many other television presenters avoid during the day.

Winfrey's first life was hard. Sometimes he lived with his mother and grandmother. While living with his grandmother, he learned to read at the age of three, and had memorized many Bible passages. Her mother was a single teenager at the time of her birth, and she had difficulty raising her. Winfrey had two stepsisters. One died young as a result of cocaine addiction, and did not find out about his other sister until 2010. Winfrey wasn't sure who his father was either.
Winfrey suffered sexual abuse from her uncle, cousin and family friend, and became pregnant at 14. However, she lost her baby shortly after birth. Winfrey survived his early years, and at 17 he won a local beauty contest before getting his first break in the media industry as a radio news anchor. This was his first step in the media market.
His show began in Chicago in 1983, and in a few years, he became No. 1 day, field interview program. He has interviewed some of the most famous people in the country on his popular program. Winfrey starred in The Color Purple, and now owns his own production company called Harpo Films.

"Donald Sterling is an American businessman who gained much of his wealth during the California real estate boom many years ago. He also owns Los Angeles Clippers, a professional basketball team from the National Basketball Association. Sterling has owned the Clippers since he bought the equipment in 1981. Although Sterling is a very successful and wealthy man, his team has seen very little success in the NBA over the years. In recent years, Clippers have made some advances in the league, having playedoffs every year since 2011.

Sterling was recently on the news for a very different reason, though. On April 25, 2014, a controversial news and entertainment program broadcast a recorded conversation between Sterling and a friend, where Sterling is heard making racial comments about some of his black friends. Sterling is not kind in his description of these friends. He said he didn't want her to bring any niggers to his Clippers games because he didn't want her to be seen publicly with them.
Sterling's ranting gained international attention. The NBA is made up of more than 90 percent of black players, so many people questioned how Sterling could feel this way about many of his own employees. Their comments created an immediate reaction from the Black community and the Americans as a whole. He was under pressure from the NBA to sell the team after many blacks commented that they would no longer attend their matches.
The NBA has issued a lifetime ban against Sterling, which effectively prohibits him from entering any arena to watch a basketball game for the rest of his life. Sterling challenged the ban, and refused to sell the equipment.",B1
"There are many traditions that American brides and grooms are expected to follow at their wedding. One of the best known traditions is that a bride throws her wedding bouquet to single guests who attend her reception. According to tradition, the single woman who takes the bouquet will be the next woman to get married. The flowers thrown may not actually be the same flowers the bride carries down the aisle during the wedding ceremony. It creates an identical bouquet for the bride to throw. This is because many times the bride wants to keep her original bouquet as a souvenir. Many women take the throwing of flowers very seriously. There have been videos documenting how women sometimes even fight each other for the nuptial branch.

The groom also has something to throw at the wedding reception. One tradition is that the groom takes a league from his new wife's leg and throws the league to single men attending the reception. According to tradition, the single man who catches the league will be the next man to get married. Sometimes the groom takes his wife's leg off with his teeth. In some wedding receptions, the man taking the league has to place it on the leg of the woman taking the bridal bouquet. Some people think this is too sexual, and just skip this part. It's the bride and groom's decision.
The bride and groom often toasted with champagne before the end of the reception. Sometimes a girlfriend and a boyfriend will leave the reception before it's over. They go straight to the airport to start their honeymoon, a special holiday celebrating their new life together.",B1

"When you rent an apartment, you need to check the lease for rules and responsibilities. For example, some owners do not want guests to spend the night. This is because the owner doesn't know who your guests are. If they damage the apartment in any way, you will be responsible. Also sometimes a friend who wants to sleep on his couch ends up staying for a long time, and ends up becoming another tenant.

You are responsible for all the utilities you use while living in a rental apartment. This means that you will have to pay for the electricity and gas you use. If the owner pays for any utility, he will say so in the lease agreement. Once you move in, you'll have to call the power company and the gas company so they can put accounts in your name. Also if you want a phone line, cable or Internet, you will need to call those companies and pay for those services yourself unless the lease says it is included in your rental.
Its owner is supposed to have access to the apartment he is renting from them. This doesn't mean they can break in whenever they want. This means that, although with prior notice, the landlord can enter the apartment for a reasonable time, which means that not in the middle of the night when you are sleeping. During this time the owner will inspect the apartment to make sure you are following the rules, and the owner can also make the necessary repairs. All this must be written in the lease. If it isn't, don't be afraid to ask the owner to add that information. Protect both the owner and you.",B1
"Barbara left college 17 years ago when she had her first daughter. He always regretted leaving her. She had been a good student, and enjoyed going to college classes. However, when he had his daughter, he did not have time to continue his studies. I needed to find a full-time job.

Barbara also regretted leaving college because it was hard to find a good job without a college degree. While Barbara was lucky enough to find work, some of the jobs she hadn't paid well. Most of them did not offer benefits such as holiday pay and health insurance. Barbara was sure that if she had a college degree, finding a better paid job with benefits would be easier.
Barbara's daughter was now a teenager. I was starting to look at the colleges. This inspired Barbara to go back to school herself. Barbara finally wanted to get her degree. Since her daughter was in high school, Barbara had more time. He didn't have to keep an eye on his daughter all the time. However, even as a teenager, Barbara's daughter still needed food and clothes, so going to college on a regular schedule was not an option for Barbara.
Barbara went to local community college to learn about her options. A college counselor told her she could take online classes to finish her degree. Barbara was worried that these classes wouldn't give the same credit as a traditional college class. The counselor told her the credits were the same, and online classes were good for non-traditional students like her. Barbara signed up and went back to being a student.",B1
"Audie Murphy is the most decorated American war hero in the history of the U.S. military. He was honored with all the prizes available during his years in the army during World War II. He also won heroism awards from two foreign governments, Belgium and France. His military record is impressive, as he fought successfully in some of the most dangerous and historic battles during the great war. Murphy was also successful after the war as an actor who appeared in several films.

Murphy was born into a very large family in Hunt, Texas. He was one of 12 children, and grew up in absolute poverty. His father left his family; his mother died at an early age, so Murphy left school to get a job. Murphy did a series of odd jobs from an early age to help the family financially, but finally realized that a military life was the best way to go.
After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Murphy knew he needed to be in the army to defend his country, but he was still not old enough to legally enlist. With the help of one of his older sisters, who helped provide him with false records, Murphy enlisted in the army at the age of 17. It wasn't long before Murphy started making his name in the army. He first saw the action in the invasion of Sicily, and was involved in the liberation of Rome. He became famous for leading his men into battle while he was wounded, and without ammunition. He won several prizes by value.
After the war, he launched a successful career in Hollywood. His most notable film was interpreted in the classic epic film From Here to Eternity, which was based on his autobiography. Murphy starred in several Western-themed films. He died at the age of 46 in a plane crash in the state of Virginia.",B1
"Car chases in the Los Angeles area are a fairly regular event. In 2013 there were more than 700 car chases. Automobile persecution has also become a source of entertainment. Many car chases are captured on video and broadcast live while they are happening. No one has to wait until the 6:00 news to know what happened. People can tune into their local TV station and see what happens in real time. These persecutions are often captured with the help of a news channel helicopter. The helicopter follows and shoots the chase through the streets, reporting the streets through which the cars pass.

People like to see car chases for many reasons. They are intense and full of drama. A spectator never knows what will happen next. Will the driver give up easily? Does the driver have a gun? Will the driver have an accident? Will anyone crossing the street be beaten? Encourage yourself to find out! Many channels see their ratings rise when they pursue aerial vehicles. They're giving people what they want.
The police are not always happy with the media covering the pursuits of live cars in the air. The police are concerned that people trying to escape enjoy the attention. The police believe that the transmission of car chase encourages people to escape. The police are also concerned that attention will lead innocent passersby to the streets. Someone might get hurt. The media insist that they have the right to show car chases. They feel like they're informing the public.
Car chases happen for many reasons. Sometimes the police are after someone who stole a car. Other times the police can try to make a routine traffic stop. However, the driver with the broken rear light may have an arrest warrant, so he drives.",B1
"A prosecutor greeted the jury at George Zimmerman's trial on Monday with an exploding appointment, while his opponent decided it was appropriate to tell the jurors a knock-knock joke.
And that was just the beginning of opening statements in the long-awaited Zimmerman murder trial.
In a case that has sparked the national debate on gun laws and race relations, Zimmerman, a neighborhood surveillance captain, is charged with second-degree murder in the 17-year-old deadly shooting, Trayvon Martin in February 2012 in Sanford, Florida.
Attorney John Guy's first words to the jury of six women may have raised some eyebrows.
Good morning. F ***** g punks, these a *****s all escape, Guy quoted Zimmerman. These were the words in this adult's mouth as he followed this boy he didn't know. Those were his words, not mine.
Zimmerman, Guy said, left his car with a gun and two flashlights to follow Trayvon Benjamin Martin, who walked home from a 7-Eleven, armed with a fruit drink and a bag of candy. Eventually the two of them got tangled up on the ground in a fight. A witness said Martin was on top of Zimmerman, Guy said.
The defendant claims that while Trayvon Martin was on top of him, he said, you are going to die tonight, Guy said. Nobody heard that.
Guy told the jurors that no witnesses saw what happened the night of the shooting from start to finish. Witnesses only saw slices of what happened, he said.
“We are sure that at the end of this trial you will know in your head, in your heart, in your stomach that George Zimmerman did not shoot Trayvon Martin because he had to,” Guy said. He shot him for the worst of all reasons, because he wanted to.
Quick facts: shooting of Trayvon Martin
On the first day of testimony, the jurors heard witnesses recount Martin's trip to the convenience store, Zimmerman's call complaining of a suspicious person walking through his neighborhood before Martin's murder, and a call from August before, in which Zimmerman reported an alleged robbery to the police.
The proceedings ended the day defense lawyer Mark O'Mara opposed the previous call, which prosecutors argued was necessary to explain Zimmerman's comment on the escape thieves.
The Martin family sat down to see the proceedings behind State Attorney Angela Corey. Before the testimony of the witnesses began, Judge Debra Nelson denied a defense petition for Martin's father, Tracy Martin, to leave the courtroom.
Tracy Martin is a potential witness, and potential witnesses may be forced to sit outside the courtroom to prevent their testimony from being contaminated by other witnesses. But the family members of the victims are allowed to stay in court even if they are expected to testify.
O'Mara also accused Tracy Martin of using an obscenity towards a friend of Zimmerman's while holding the door for him during an audience two weeks ago. The friend, Timothy Tucholski, testified that he had not wanted to do a problem with him before.
I wasn't planning on coming here. “I don’t want to be sitting here,” he said.
But Nelson denied the request, and Martin remained in court, but Zimmerman's parents were covered by the rule regarding potential witnesses and had to sit outside, as did Benjamin Crump, Martin's parents' lawyer.
At one point, Martin's father began to cry as Guy detailed how officers tried to save his son's life. Zimmerman has looked forward with no signs of emotion.
After Guy's statement, defense attorney Don West came forward to court the jury. When it started, he told a knock-knock joke. But he couldn't win a laugh. Knock knock. Who's there? George Zimmerman. George Zimmerman who? Well, you're on the jury, he said. Later, West apologized. No more bad jokes, I promise, he told the jurors. I was convinced it was the delivery.
West quickly went on with the business of making his case: that Zimmerman was forced to act in self-defense to save his own life.
The evidence will prove that this is a sad case; there are no monsters here... George Zimmerman is not guilty of murder. He shot Trayvon Martin after being brutally attacked.
With the help of PowerPoint images, West spent hours hammering his argument.
He broke Zimmerman's 911 call, where he first reported seeing Martin and told him he was following him.
Little did George Zimmerman know at that time in less than 10 minutes of him first seeing Travyon Martin that he, George Zimmerman, would be hit in the face, have his head hit concretely and end up shooting and tragically killing Trayvon Martin, West told the jurors.
West also deconstructed a 911 call made by a neighbor, in which it is possible to hear screams and a shot in the background that West said was the sound of the deadly bullet.
While the dramatic sound of the recording filled the room, Zimmerman showed no emotion. Martin's mother left the room.
The moment this really became physical was that Trayvon Martin -- I will use my words -- that Trayvon Martin decided to confront George Zimmerman, West said. That's not going home. He had plenty of time. This is, what, 60 or 70 yards. A lot of time. I could have come and gone four or five times.
West quoted a witness named John Good who described the fight. He called it Martin's dirt and dust, who he said was on top of Zimmerman, hitting him.
He saw enough to make this serious, West said. Zimmerman asked for help, looked at Good and said, help me. But the beating continued as Good broke into his house to call 911, West said.
There was a shot. Shortly after, according to West, Zimmerman said Martin was hitting me, and I shot him.
West also discussed the prosecution's claim that Martin was unarmed.
Travyon Martin armed himself with the concrete sidewalk and used it to break George Zimmerman's head, West said. It's no different than if he took a brick or broke his head against a wall. It's a deadly weapon.
West showed the jurors pictures taken of Zimmerman after the fight. “What you can really see in these photos that you will have in evidence are the lumps,” West said. The big knots on either side of his head. Consistent with having his head hit against concrete.
Female jury to judge Zimmerman
Among the first prosecution witnesses they called was the 911 dispatcher who received Zimmerman's call before the shooting. Seat Noffke testified that he was trained to give general orders rather than direct orders to people.
When Zimmerman said he was following Martin, Noffke told him, okay, we don't need you to do that. Noffke told the D.A. he's responsible for any direct order he gives to someone.
In the cross-examination, defense attorney O'Mara pointed out that Noffke asked Zimmerman, where is he headed?
If you tell someone twice to let you know if the person they're worried about is doing anything else... do you think they're gonna watch them? He asked O'Mara.
“I cannot answer that,” Noffke said.
“You told him twice to let you know if that guy did anything else,” O’Mara said.
“Yes, sir,” Noffke said.
Noffke continued to say that he only wanted a location of the suspect for the officers and that he never told Zimmerman to follow or watch Martin.
Shortly before the court set in motion, Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, spoke to journalists, asking people to pray for me and my family because I don't want any other mother to experience what I'm going through now.
There are no testimonies from state experts about 911 calls.
Martin was black, and Zimmerman identifies as Hispanic.
In a CNN poll published on Monday morning, 62% of respondents say that the charges against Zimmerman are probably or definitely true.

"Emma felt very bad when someone from her daughter Jessica's school informed her that Jessica needed special education services. Emma felt she had failed as a mother. It was true that Jessica was always delayed when it came to learning to talk and walk. Emma thought her son was different. Each child develops at its own pace. Jessica was five years old now, but she still didn't speak in full sentences. Jessica wouldn't be attending a regular kindergarten at a regular school. Instead, he would attend kindergarten at a special education school.

Although this bothered Emma at first, she soon learned to appreciate school. Jessica had a specialized learning plan called Individualized Education Plan or IEP. This plan set specific goals for Jessica, such as learning to feed. Jessica also received a lot of individual attention. Instead of being in a classroom with 20 students, there were only 8 students in their class. All these students were also delayed as Jessica. In addition, the class had two assistants from the teacher to help the class teacher.
The special education school also scheduled speech therapy sessions for Jessica. Once a day, a specialist came to work with Jessica to help her practice learning to move her mouth and tongue and ask for what she needed and wanted. An occupational therapist helped Jessica learn to feed herself and other appropriate age self-sufficiency skills. A physical therapist also came to help Jessica.
Emma may have been embarrassed at the beginning that her daughter was in a special education school, but after a year, Emma realized it was the best thing for her. While Jessica was still a little behind other children her age, at the end of kindergarten, she was able to attend a non-special education school.",B1
"When William worked in Santa Fe Springs, California, in the 1990s, he told me that he thought the building he worked in was haunted. ""It really is,"" William said. ""I have had more than a few incidents that have happened to me while working alone, late at night,"" he continued. William worked as a manager of a very busy chemical distribution company at the time. To keep up with his work, he sometimes had to work at night, or go on weekends to catch up on his paperwork.

William was a wise man. He wasn't the kind of person who would fly out of control in worrying situations. He was always very quiet, and composed. This is what made your story credible. I knew he wasn't the type to make things up.
One night, William went to work after dark and thought nothing of it. His former manager had told him that he could hear some strange noises coming from the warehouse, but it was only the 55-gallon drums that expanded and contracted. During the heat of the day, the drums expanded, and at night, when it cooled, the drums contracted, sometimes making a sound. William wasn't worried.
That night he was sitting on his desk when he heard what sounded like someone knocking on the door leading to the warehouse. William dismissed it as a popping drum, and ignored it. A few moments later, the sound returned, and this time it was stronger. Since there was no one else in the building, he got a little nervous, but he continued to work. Soon the noises became louder and louder. The final height was when he heard someone walk over the roof of his office. This scared him a little, but again he ignored him. Finally, it happened again, and this time William ran to the warehouse to look over his office, but there was no one there. After that, William never went back to work at night.",B1
"Whether you travel to the islands or to the mountains of Thailand, you are likely to spend at least one night in your capital on the way. Bangkok can be noisy and contaminated, but it is also an exciting city with many things to see and do. Why not make it a longer stay?
Where to stay
The Khao San Road was a famous traveller's spot even before Leonardo di Caprio's character in the film The Beach stayed there. But it's noisy, not very pretty and not very Thai. For something more authentic, Phra Kanong offers an alternative place to stay, with its fantastic street markets where every day the people of Bangkok eat, work and live. Not so convenient for major tourist sites, but it has a Skytrain station so you can be in the Grand Palace in 20 minutes.
How to move
Bangkok traffic can be a nightmare. Sure, you can easily take a taxi – if you want to spend hours stuck in traffic jams – but there are two much better ways to move around the city. To explore the temples and historic sites, take an express taxi or a long-tailed boat along the Chao Phraya River and canals. For the modern part of the city, Skytrain is a quick and cheap way to travel from the river to the shopping malls and nightlife of Sukhumvit, and the famous Chatuchak Street market.
Where to eat
The simple answer is: everywhere! Street Thai food is one of the best in the world, and for about $5 you can eat a full and delicious meal. Some food stalls have small plastic seats where you can sit and eat and cook the same dish over and over again, such as fried chicken in rice or Pad Thai noodles. Head to Chinatown – Yaowarat Street – and choose what seems most interesting among the excellent Chinese and Thai restaurants and food stalls.
What to do
Having seen major sites such as the Giant Buddha in Wat Pho Temple and the spectacular Grand Palace, and having bought at Chatuchak Market, check out the snake farm and watch the live snake show. You can even touch a snake if you want!",B1
"Jacquelyn and his family were sleeping at home. His dog Scruffy was asleep next to Jacquelyn. It was 4:36 a.m. and the night was quiet. There were no cars passing through the street, no noise could be heard, it was as if everything was still. Jacquelyn always put a cup of water next to her bed, so that if she was thirsty during the night she wouldn't have to walk to the kitchen. That's when it happened. The furniture began to shake, and the cup of water fell to the ground. Scruffy started barking and Jacquelyn woke up. He looked around and saw all his things shaking. He started screaming. Soon after, his father came in and told him to leave quickly.

It was an earthquake. Jacquelyn was so scared, and she couldn't move. Her father came in and picked her up. He took her outside, where Jacquelyn's mother and brother were already. Jacquelyn and his brother were crying. They didn't understand what was going on.
Luckily Jacquelyn's mother had prepared an emergency kit and had it outside. He looked for the key, which was hidden inside a fake rock, and opened the box. He took out blankets to keep his children warm. Jacquelyn looked at his mother and took the blanket. Then he saw his father take a flashlight from the box. He used the flashlight to see if the house had any damage. The father knew the house was not safe, so they stayed awake until someone could examine the house.
The children had no school due to the earthquake, so they spent the day with their parents. Jacquelyn was so proud of her parents, because they knew what to do during this disaster. He talked to his friends, and they weren't so lucky. Jacquelyn approached his parents and hugged them because he knew he felt the protection of his parents.",B1
"Drought in the southeast of the United States means more than brown grass for people in Orme, Tennessee. Water flows from their taps for only three hours each night.
A 1961 fire truck is loaded with water from a mouth of water in Alabama to transport back to Orme, Tennessee.
The mountain spring that supplies water to the village tends to dry at the end of the summer, but only for a few days. This year it dried up early on August 1, and has not revived, leaving the 145 residents of the city tall and dry and depending on the water transported from the next state.
Every day at 6 p.m., Mayor of Orme Tony Reames turns a large valve to release water from the city tank. When you turn the crank again at 9 p.m., the taps of the city dry.
“When it was cut, we leaped for joy,” Orme resident Debbie Cash said. And then you only have it for three hours.

The old mining city could be the canary in the coal mine for the rest of the region. Just 150 miles south-east, the 4.5 million people living in and around Atlanta, Georgia, are nervously observing the water levels that go down in their main reservoir. The drought has highlighted an ongoing struggle between Georgia, Alabama and Florida for water rights from the Chattahoochee River.
All these people who are in the river systems better take note, because once their streams and tributaries to the river begin to dry up, the river is not far away, Reames said. See photos of a shrunk reservoir in Lake Lanier, Atlanta
Volunteers take turns three days a week driving a tanker truck or diesel fire truck from Orme 1961 to a water mouth near Bridgeport, Alabama, 2 1/2 miles down the road. Several round-trip trips carry around 25,000 gallons of water back to Orme every day.
Bridgeport, which receives its water from the Tennessee River, does not charge its neighbor. Stevenson and New Hope, Alabama, also help, occasionally carrying trucks full of water to the mouth of water, where it is transferred to the Orme trucks. Look where Orme has to go for water.
But things are getting better in Orme. A Bridgeport pipeline is almost finished, built with the help of a $378,000 grant from the federal government.
“With this new water entering, then we will have it made,” Cash said. Now we don't have to worry about that anymore.
In addition, a company in Austin, Texas, called H2O Guard, plans to donate water-saving sink aerations, shower heads, and toilet valves to everyone in Orme on November 17, said company spokesman Robert Easter.
We think we're going to get another 90 gallons saving a day per house, said Easter. That'll make that little water tower in that city go from three hours to four hours without any change in anyone's habits.
Reames said residents have found creative ways to conserve, flushing toilets with condensation water from air conditioners and non-potable water from pools that were filled in early summer.
It's a lesson for everyone.
“Take care of the water you have and be careful with it,” Cash said, “because you never know if you will run out of water. E-mail to a friend

"Chris knew exactly where he was on January 28, 1986. In fact, almost all Americans can remember what they were doing at the time the Challenger space shuttle exploded. It is one of the most tragic moments in the history of the country, and it is one that will not be forgotten. Chris worked as an employee at a clothing manufacturing plant in Commerce, California, which is about three kilometers from downtown Los Angeles.

That morning he was filing some documents when one of his co-workers came through the door into a large work area containing about 20 employees. ""The shuttle just exploded,"" he shouted. Most of the employees were surprised. They had no idea what I was talking about. Again, he said, ""The space shuttle just exploded in Florida."" Chris knew at the time that something was going very wrong.
The space shuttle program began in the early 1980s, and continued to this day. The fleet consists of several shuttles that are designed to go into space, establish an orbit, and do a variety of tasks. It was announced as a new era in space exploration. In the past, space exploration vehicles were once used, and then discarded. The shuttle programme revolutionized the way space travel was carried out.
Chris couldn't believe his ears. Soon almost all the employees huddled around the TV in the lunch room watching with horror the events taking place. It was a sad day for the United States, but it was also the beginning of a new era in space travel. The country recovered from this disaster and resumed its program after a couple of years. There have been other accidents in the program, and especially in Columbia, which disintegrated upon re-entry in February 2003, but the United States will not be deterred. Space travel is dangerous, but the spirit of the American people will not be contained.",B1
"An opening party is a special party that is held when someone buys or moves to a new apartment or house. The person or persons who bought the property or moved are the ones who organize the party. The party is an opportunity for friends and family to congratulate the person for the new home. It also gives people the opportunity to see what the new home looks like. It is an opportunity to fill the new space with love and hopefully presents.

It's traditional to bring a gift to an opening party. Some people register a list of items they want or need for their new home in a local store or stores. Some common items that people will put in a gift register include kitchen tools such as knives and items like curtains. Even if there is no record, a good opening gift is something to decorate the new house with like a work of art or a plant. You can also bring food or drinks to share with other guests. This is often appreciated as at an opening of the house there is not much food served, usually only snacks or sandwiches. There are usually no planned activities like games at a housewarming party. The hostess or hostess of the party, however, will probably give all guests a tour of their new home. Sometimes, because a housewarming party happens shortly after a person moves into their new home, people can be asked to help unpack boxes. But this is not usual.
Opening parties are named after the fact that long ago people would bring firewood to a new home as a gift. This was so that the person could keep their home warm for the winter. Now most houses have central heating and do not use fires to keep warm.",B1
"Surfing was Jeffrey's favorite hobby. Every weekend Jeffrey and his best friend Chad were heading to Santa Monica Beach, where they surfed great waves. California was the perfect place to live if you were a surfer. The sunny sky and pleasant temperature made it an ideal place for surfing. Best of all, California especially keeps this kind of good weather all year round. Jeffrey and Chad were grateful to be surfers in California and not Iceland. While his other friends were skating and skating, Jeffrey and Chad were on the beach surfing the day away.

Jeffrey was 15 when he learned how to surf. Chad was two years younger when she started learning. They had both met at a surf competition. Jeffrey was eighteen and Chad was sixteen at the time of the competition. Despite being rivals at first, Jeffery and Chad soon became friends after the competition. Now twenty-one and nineteen, Jeffrey and Chad had become the best surfers on the West Coast. His medals and trophies were proof of that.
There was nothing more satisfying in the world than to navigate the waters as the sun rose from above and the wind blew. Surfing was an exciting and incredible experience. He was also a great stress reliever. Jeffery and Chad felt like they were on top of the world when they were surfing. Nothing else mattered when you were in the middle of a barrel ride. Jeffery and Chad knew that surfing for them would be a lifelong passion.
The beach was a great place to be. This was especially true in the summer, when beautiful girls met on weekends, bonfires lined up the coasts at night, and vendors and artists attracted visitors to buy their products. There was never a dull moment on the beach. But if it wasn't for the waters, Jeffrey and Chad would have no reason to go to the beach.",B1

"A man suspected of killing three people in Panama is now wanted in the murder of an American woman whose body was found last week, Panama's national police said on Saturday.
Cher Hughes's body, a native of suburban St. Louis, Missouri, was found Tuesday on the property of William Adolfo Cortez Reese, who is suspected in his death, said Javier Carrillo, director of the national police investigation unit.
Carrillo said Cortez and his wife, Jane, are on the run. Cortez can be from Holland. We're not sure that's his real identity, he said. We found a fake passport.
He said Panamanian authorities are trying to reach the police in Holland.
Hughes, who was about 50, was identified by her husband, Keith Werle, who lives in Panama. A second body -- which has not yet been officially identified -- was found near Hughes.
“We believe the reason is that he—LRB—William Cortez—RRB—is killing people to take their property,” Carrillo said.
He added that the authorities do not know the whereabouts of Cortez and that they have not received any information from the public.
Werle said he was on Cortez's property, a huge farmland on Columbus Island in the western province of Boca del Toro, while police were carrying out a search warrant. He said his dog took the authorities to a shallow grave, where they found Hughesbody.
Dwayne Cooney, a friend of the family, said Hughes had lived in Panama for the past decade and owned a hotel, the House of Toad, in Boca del Torro. He described Hughes and Cortez as friends and neighbors.
Hughes had lived in St. Petersburg, Florida, where he had a neon sign business, before moving to Panama, Cooney said.

"One of the most recent social changes taking place in the United States and the world is the creation of social networks. The creation of social networks in itself is not a novelty. These types of groups have existed for at least 150 years, and probably more than that. In times before the invention of the personal computer, and the advent of the World Wide Web, social networks were made in person. People who had similar tastes and interests gathered together to share experiences, make new contacts and promote themselves or their businesses.

On the Internet, social media websites first appeared in the late 1990s. The first major social media website in the United States was MySpace. MySpace was a social media site that allowed its users to exchange messages, share photos and make new friends in a way that had never been thought of in the past. With MySpace, people who didn't get out much could reach others from the comfort of their own homes.
Facebook was created in 2004. It was originally a website created for use by students, graduates, and professors at Harvard University, but soon expanded to include almost everyone. Facebook is an elaborate social networking site that has grown incredibly fast. It is now larger than some of the world's largest companies. It is a website that is constantly changing. New features are added regularly. Facebook has revolutionized the way people remain connected to each other and to the rest of the world. The way it works is simple. Users can easily set up a new account. All a new user needs is an email address to get started. Once a person has created an account, they can invite friends by sending a request to people they know who also have their own Facebook pages. Once you start, making new friends will come easily.",B1

"Salem in the state of Massachusetts is called the ""City of the Witch,"" but don't be afraid. There are no women in pointed black hats riding brooms. The city of New England is called the Witch City due to an infamous set of evidence that occurred there in 1692 to 1693. At that time, the city was just a town in the British colony of Massachusetts. The Salem witch's trials accused more than 200 people of being witches. People thought witchcraft was real and criminal. The defendants included women, men and even children. Nineteen people were sentenced to death. They were all hanged. One of the defendants was tortured with heavy stones placed on him until he was crushed below weight. Seven others died in prison.

There was never evidence that the defendants and convicts were witches. Historians think people would accuse people of family disputes. Other historians think there was a domino effect, with people becoming hysterical after an accusation. Fear of witches spreads like a disease.
The Salem Bruges Trials have become part of the city's history. ""The Crucible"", a play about Arthur Miller's trials, has become a film. The city is not ashamed of its past, but uses it to teach tolerance and earn some tourist dollars. There's a monument dedicated to the innocent people who died because of the witch hunt. There's a ""Witch Museum"" that tells the story of what happened. Many people visit Salem around Halloween. Salem police cars have witch logos. A local public school is known as the Witchcraft Heights Elementary School, and the sports teams at Salem High School are called the Witches. Movies and television shows featuring fiction witches have been filmed in Salem, including ""Hocus Pocus"" and ""Bewitched"".",B1
"March 14th is my favorite day for being a nerd.
Throughout the country, the mathematical geeks of museums, schools, private groups and other places gather to celebrate the number pi, approximately 3.14. That's why March 14th -- 3-14 -- is Pi Day. Besides, Albert Einstein was born on this day.
A quick review: Pi is defined as the distance around a perfect circle, or the circumference, divided by the distance through it, or the diameter. He is also involved in calculating the area of a circle, the volume of a sphere, and many other mathematical formulas that he might need in the sciences.
Throughout history, people have been captivated by this number because there is no way to calculate it exactly by a simple split in their calculator. What is more, its digits continue infinitely, without any pattern in numbers. 3,1415926535897932... etc. Even that many digits are more than most people would need for their daily use, but some people have been inspired to memorize thousands of digits of pi, or even use digits to create poetry or music.
On Pi Day, a number smells like mystery'
Math can be terrifying, but pi is not, as the great fun of Pi Day shows. You could say... gasp! - It's great to like Pi these days. Even the House of Representatives supported the designation of 14 March as National Pi Day in 2009.
In countries where the day is written before the month, Friday is 14-3, which looks less like pi. And so Pi Day is an acquired taste, mathematician Jonathan Borwein, at Newcastle University in Australia, said in an email.
Conveniently, pi sounds like cake, and the cakes are round. You could celebrate Pi Day in a casual way by grabbing a slice of pastry or pizza. If you're enrolled in school, your math class or math department might be doing something special by now.
But if you live in a particularly pi-happy place, you might be able to take part in some larger-scale, pi-inspired activities.
Where Pi Day began
If you want to go where the day is said to have been invented, look no further than the San Francisco Exploratory. Larry Shaw, who worked in the electronics group at the museum, began the tradition in 1988. Last year was the 25th anniversary of Pi Day.
Pi Day began as a small meeting with most museum staff. Now it is a public extravagance with a procession of pi, whose assistants get a number -- 0 to 9 -- and line up in the order of pi digits: 3,14159265... you get the idea.
The parade ends at the shrine pi - a pi symbol with spiral digits around him embedded on the sidewalk, which was unveiled last year.
For those who cannot attend in person, the Exploratory has a Second Life Pi Day event that includes irrational exhibitions, fireworks, cheerleaders, music and dance. The museum also lists a lot of educational activities to teach about the concept of pi.
Pi's day, is it an attack on Piunder?
Where Einstein lived
On the opposite coast, the lush university city where Albert Einstein spent the last 22 years of his life is showing community exuberance for pi.
Princeton, New Jersey, kicks off the Pi Day weekend on Thursday night with a reading from physicist Charles Adler, then heads for a full day of activities on Friday, including a walking tour of Einstein's neighborhood and a pastry pizza contest.
The cake eating contest is held at McCaffrey's supermarket, while an Einstein competition will resemble mustaches and wild grey hair at Princeton Public Library.
Pi fans who have been spending the last year memorizing digits can show up and compete in the library, where the winner between 7 - at 13 years of age, can take home a fresh pi-hundred -LRB- That is, $314.15 -RRB-. The Princeton Historical Society is having an Einstein birthday party. Tetsuya Miyamoto, inventor of the KENKEN puzzle, will also speak in the library.
Here's 10,000 digits of pi for you to memorize.
The residents of the Brainiac city love this event because it is a way to celebrate how peculiar they are, said Mimi Omiecinski, owner of the Princeton Tour Company, which started Princeton Pi Day in 2009. A lot of them get super into this. Last year some 9,000 people participated, he said.
Along with his fascination with Albert Einstein, Omiecinski was inspired to launch a Pi Day throughout the city after he learned that Princeton University's mathematics department celebrates March 14 with eating cakes and pi-reciping -LRB- As a Princeton student, I got second place for most digits in 2005 and 2006 -RRB-.
Even more pi
Chicago is also getting into the pi business. Many restaurants and bakeries offer Pi Day specialities. The Illinois Scientific Council and Fleet Feet Sports are organizing a 3.14 mile ride/run Friday night, with discounts for anyone named Alberta or Albertina. Philly.com highlights two options to satisfy your cake cravings in the City of Fraternal Love.
Bostonians can go to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at Pi time -LRB- 3:14 p.m. -RRB- for pi-themed activities such as Pie Throw to your best friend in high-speed camera.
The Boston Science Museum has Pi Day educational events, and the Seattle Children's Museum will also celebrate it.
Even the Salvador Dalí Museum in St.Petersburg, Florida, will celebrate the day, as Dalí loved irrational Pi and Phi numbers, often using them and other mathematical principles in his art, according to the museum. If you live in the area, check out their math-inspired movie program and tour all day.
There are also many resources online, as requested.org.
Outside the physical classroom, Pi Day will be held online through Google's virtual classroom project. David Blatner, author of the full book The Joy of Pi, is organizing a Pi Day contest in which students from three classrooms approach to see who can recite the most pi digits of memory.
How did Pi Day become such a big thing?
Blatner says Pi Day has become a success for the same reason that the new Cosmos TV show is getting so much attention.
People around the world are hungry to make science and mathematics fun and interesting, he said in an email. We know that mathematics and science are important, we know it's fascinating, but we often don't know how to make it fun and interesting. Pi Day gives us a great excuse to throw away our fear of math and say hey, it's a little clean!
If you agree, you just have to wait until 14/03/15 -- or as a popular Facebook group calls it, the only Pi day of our lives.
That's because pi to four digits after the decimal is 3,1415, and it's unlikely that we survive until 2115 to see that second instance of perfection pi.
So get ready next year to take a picture of your digital clock at 3/14/15 at 9:26:53 a.m. That'll be worth over a thousand digits.

"Ken received many reminders by mail in the weeks leading up to the first Tuesday of November, election day. Since before becoming a citizen of the United States, he hoped to be able to choose who would represent him at the various levels of government. Shortly after taking the citizenship oath, Ken filled out a short paper form, registering him to vote and choosing an affiliation to a political party. Ken appreciated that choosing a specific political party did not limit who could vote, however. He was free to vote for someone from the party he signed up for. I could even vote for someone from a different party. Since his vote was secret, no one would know anyway.

Now that he was a naturalized citizen, Ken spent many hours looking at the various voter guides that appeared in his mailbox. At the national level, Ken could vote for president, members of Congress. At the state level, Ken could vote for state congressmen and the state governor. At the local level, Ken could vote for mayor, councillors and members of the local school board.
He was a little overwhelmed by the elections. In addition to receiving mail about the various candidates, he saw many announcements with the position of each candidate on various topics. There was also a televised debate, which helped show what candidates have in common and how they differ.
Ken was nervous the day he went to vote. He went to his local polling station. A pollster requested Ken's name and address to verify that he was registered. Ken confirmed his record by signing next to his name. Then he was given a vote and taken to a booth where he had to make some difficult decisions.",B1
"Over the decades, celebrities have chosen various ways to deal with an increasingly intrusive medium. Such methods have included suing - LRB- Jacqueline Kennedy -RRB-, hitting -LRB- Marlon Brando -RRB- and putting a bag over the head -LRB- Shia LaBeouf -RRB-.
But Alec Baldwin's coping mechanism opens a new chapter in the paparazzi wars. After the TMZ celebrity gossip site published images of Baldwin shouting blasphemy to an aggressive videographer -LRB- with audio cushioned that may or may not have contained a gay insult -RRB-, Baldwin published a bitter farewell to the essay of public life in New York magazine.
Before we permanently lose other celebrities to their secret hideouts, it's time to consider a way to fight the paparazzi. In fact, Baldwin was on the cusp of discovering a new â€$ weapon that he didn't notice.
After the first reading of Baldwin's diatribe, the solution - LRB- may have been lost after all, the piece is quite long and sometimes exhausting -RRB-. But the answer is to look us in the face. In fact, he's looking us all in the face. Every day.
“These days,” Baldwin said, “everybody has a camera in their pocket. Not only the Ron Galellas of the world, but all the audiences of John Q. looking for the opportunity to embarrass a celebrity. This kind of world is too much for Baldwin, who is prone to lose his temper.
But if the cameras are small, cheap and omnipresent, why not use them in their favor? Why not take one with you when you go in public, ensuring that the public can always see your side of the story? “They are harassing you,” Baldwin said in his farewell to the world. You can say they want to get into it with you. Some people bump into me or block the entrance to my apartment... exactly. Then why don't we get them on the spot?
Does that sound like too much trouble? Maybe. But if you're rich like Baldwin, why don't you hire someone to follow you and record your life as it happens? Go on with your daily life, but have a trusted and well-paid photographer at your side, documenting how rude, invasive and aggressive celebrity chasers can be.
Does it still sound unreasonable? There is another solution that has just been made available. You can record your daily interactions with a portable camera embedded in your glasses. If you want to show the world what really happened to that idiot photographer, just upload the images from your Google Glass. As USA Today reported earlier this month, police departments are using portable cameras to protect both the police and citizens from unfair accusations.
All this may sound extreme. Why do celebrities have to go so far to protect themselves? It may be a lot of trouble, but isn't it better than being repeatedly humiliated by outbursts out of context? Isn't it better than retiring from a job you love and living as a hermit for the rest of your life? Baldwin said in his diatribe, “You are out there in a world where if you make a mistake, it echoes in a digital cannon forever.” Right, but not if you can show your side of the story.
It may be too late for Baldwin, but not for other celebrities. Don't disappear from public life just for in spite of the paparazzi. If you do, celebrity gossip sites will win. It is time for a twenty-first century solution. It's time to fight photos with photos.

The first graph illustrates the percentage of the population that owned a smartphone between 2011 and 2016, and the second breaks down the percentages by age for 2011 and 2016.
In general, smartphone ownership increased over the six-year period. In general, the younger ones were more likely to own a smartphone. However, the most significant increases in smartphone ownership between 2011 and 2016 were from 45 to 54 years old, from 46% to 84%; from 55 to 64, from 9% to 59%; and from 65 to 74 years old, from 5% to 50%.
The percentage of people who owned a smartphone increased steadily, starting at around 35% in 2011 and reaching around 77% in 2016. Persons aged 16-24 represented the highest percentage of smartphone ownership in 2011 and 2016. Seventy-five per cent of people aged 25 to 34 and 72 per cent of those aged 35 to 44 had a smartphone in 2011, an increase of 88 per cent and 86 per cent, respectively, in 2016.
Although almost no one in the category over 75 years old owned a smartphone in 2011, 15% of this group possessed smartphones in 2016.

"She is the daughter of a Beatle, everyone's fashion designer, from Madonna to the British Olympic team, winner of a Queen Elizabeth medal, and counts Kate Moss among her friends.
From all appearances, Stella McCartney's life has been a haunted life, not that she necessarily sees it that way.
The fame has followed Paul McCartney's second son and the wife of American photographer Linda from the moment she was born.
And it has been both a blessing and an obstacle.
As McCartney was awarded this year with the prestigious Lincoln Center Corporate Fund Women's Leadership Award, CNN spoke to mother of four about sustainability in a notoriously irresponsible fashion industry.
Influence of parents
CNN: You had models to follow very famous -- do you think that helped you, or do you think it was actually an obstacle?
McCartney: It certainly opened many doors and certainly closed some minds. So I think there was a balance.
CNN: What do you think was the biggest inspiration you got from your mother, Linda McCartney?
M: I learned a lot from your ethics. Both my mother and father - LSB - former Beatle, Paul McCartney -RSB - are known for being vegetarians, activists for world rights and environmentalists, and that definitely came to my place of work.
Once you have children, add another layer of responsibility to what you're doing. You have to be a role model for them, so it makes you question your actions -- in a good way.
The Biggest Challenge
CNN: What is the biggest challenge you've ever encountered to get to where you are now?
M: At first, when I wanted to go back to London and start my own fashion house, a very well thought-out executive in the industry told me: Name a designer who comes from Britain and has had any kind of global success.
I wanted to show him I was wrong. Obviously there have been great women in Britain in design, but there is actually less than I thought. So that was a small obstacle for me.
Since the first day I've never worked with leather or leather. I don't work with PVC, and I'm very aware of the supply and manufacturing of fashion. That's an obstacle, it's a challenge, but it's worth it.
CNN: Do you feel a lot of pressure from the industry because you chose to follow the path of sustainable fashion?
M: It's been difficult, it's still difficult, but I'm fine with the difficult, it's what keeps me on my feet. I've made people tell me: you'll never sell bags, you won't work with leather and leather is luxury.
To me it is quite the opposite, the leather is everywhere, it is so cheap a material, it is so mass produced. More than 50 million animals a year are killed only by fashion. It doesn't have a luxury element for me.
CNN: So you feel comfortable turning that idea into your head, that leather is luxury?
M: Many things have existed for a long time, that doesn't mean they have to stay forever. When you're in design it's your job to change, push, modernize.
The fashion industry, it's not really that responsible for any reason. We are not expected to respond to the fact that it is not sustainable to kill so many animals for shoes and bags. And you don't have to! Ninety percent of the people who come to my stores have no idea I don't work with leather.
Tell him not to.
CNN: You get really strong when you talk about people who tell you you can't do anything.
M: Not everyone, who likes to be told they can't do something? Anyone can do what they want, if they really want it.
I'm not going to pretend that I don't come from a privileged starting point. I'll always admit it was easier for me to interrogate people by telling me that I couldn't do something because I had a very nice place to fall back into. So maybe that gave me a little more spark and struggle.
I'm learning as I get older, you don't have to try to fight everything from a man's house. I guess I got here for a reason, it wasn't because I was a woman.

"Anthony wanted to get cable TV for the new apartment he rented with his wife and children. He was especially interested in seeing channels from his home country. He called the local cable company to sign up. There were plenty of options for Anthony to choose from. The basic service was the least expensive, but it did not include any of his country's channels. So Anthony signed a package that included channels from his country. However, that package did not include the cartoon channels that his children liked to see. So he added an expanded package to include cartoon channels. That still omitted channels showing certain series that his wife liked to watch. So Anthony signed up for a special promotion that included a premium channel for a free month.

The customer service representative set an appointment to send a technician to Anthony's house in a week. The date wasn't for an exact hour. Instead, the customer service representative said the technician would come between noon and 2:00 p.m. When the technician arrived, he installed a conversion box and a digital recorder box for family television in the living room. The tech gave Anthony a remote control and a channel guide. Anthony had to sign some papers before the technician left.
Anthony, his wife and children enjoyed the hundreds of channels they now had thanks to the cable. A month after the technician arrived and installed all the equipment, a bill arrived. The bill totaled almost $200. Anthony couldn't pay so much monthly. He discussed it with his wife. They decided not to keep their country's channels and premium channels that his wife enjoyed. The only extra channels Anthony had were cartoon channels for his children.",B1
"Once you find an apartment you want to rent, you should contact the owner, the person who owns the property. Most owners are no longer individuals, but companies that own a number of properties. You and the owner will set a date to see the place you are interested in renting.

On that date you can see the apartment and ask questions. Some owners will require you to fill out an application. The request will ask questions about your work, salary, and how many people will live with you in the apartment. The owner wants to make sure they have responsible tenants who will pay the rent on time. Some owners even ask for references, names and phone numbers of people who can verify that you have a job and are a responsible person. Most owners will also execute a credit check. A credit check is your bill payment history on time. If your potential owner sees that you owe a lot of money to different companies and don't pay your bills on time, they may not want you as a tenant. If you have a bad credit or unstable work history, you may be required to get a co-signer, who is another financially responsible adult to sign the rent, a rental agreement, with you. This co-signer is legally responsible for paying the rent if you stop paying.
If you can't afford a full apartment, another option is to rent a room in someone's house. The process of renting a room is like renting an apartment, except that it only has one room and usually has to share the bathroom and kitchen. Most apartments and rooms in the U.S. They're unfurnished. You are expected to bring your own furniture, including a bed, a dresser, a sofa and anything else you need.",B1
"After they told him for the umpteenth time that the beer he wanted would be “too dark and too strong for you, love – have something sweeter,” Rebecka Singerer had had enough.
“No, I don’t want a fruit beer. Women can drink whatever they want,” she says.
Now Singerer, a nanny, has joined FemAle, a group of like-minded drinkers in Gothenburg, to launch the first Swedish beer made by women.
We can do it, a pale bottled beer, just came out for sale in stores all over Sweden. Its label is a capture of Rosie the Riveter, the creation of a World War II propaganda campaign that went on to become a symbol of women's power in the workplace.
The group's founder is 25-year-old Elin Carlsson, who paints cars at the Volvo factory outside the city. “We can do it It’s not a female beer, but a beer made by women that anyone can drink,” he says. “It has nothing to do with feminism; it’s about equality – we wanted to show that we can do it.”
FemAle faces decades of prejudice in the beer world. In an irony that is not lost in FemAle, Carlsberg and other big brewers have spent millions in recent years trying to sell beer to women, trying to “shrunk it and shrink it” to appeal to perceived female tastes. The offers of Carlsberg Eve and Copenhagen, Foster’s Radler and Coors’s Animée were among the lightest, aromatized and even “swelling resistant” beers that could not find a market.
FemAle's approach is different, with tastings only for women that allow potential customers to experiment with flavors and styles of beer that they usually can't taste. This educational process is the way to “introduce more girls into the beer world,” the group says. “Bring your mother, sister, girlfriend, aunt and grandmother so we can all learn more about beer.”
FemAle's idea arose after women continued to crash into beer festivals.
We Can Do It was the idea of Felicia Nordström, a bar worker who said she was sick of bearded beer snobs saying, “What do you know about beer, honey?” She approached FemAle and joined Ocean, an independent local micro-cervestry. One weekend they invented the recipe and the next they prepared 1,600 liters.
“This is not a beer for women, it’s our most juicy beer,” says Thomas Bingero, Ocean’s main brewer. “When large breweries target women, it usually fails. This is something completely different.”
The first batch of We Can Do was sold almost before it was made. FemAle has already been approached by other breweries asking if they can prepare new beers with them.
We can do it Use three malts – Maris Otter, Amber and a Thomas Fawcett wheat malt – and the Galaxy and Cascade hop varieties. Its IBU, or bitterness level, is 65 and its alcohol content is 4.6%.
“Women opt for a glass of wine because they don’t know what beer is about; they don’t know what to order,” says Carlsson. “We open new worlds for you.”
“I didn’t like the strong ones, but at the time I only drank Pripps [a light, Swedish beer],” says Singerer, 38. “Guinness tastes like water to me now. There are imperial stouts that are like drinking biscotti submerged in espresso coffee.
Women are part of a brewing explosion in Sweden, which is developing a passion for artisanal, bottled and current beers. The standard Stor Stark beer (big strong) is now “almost extinct” in Gothenburg, say women, as pubs and bars replace the big brands with a selection of specialized beers.
“All girls are different – there is no typical beer-loving woman. Anyone can do it,” says Emma Henriksson, 22, a member of the group working in a garden equipment company.
“Every pub wants to learn how to reach women,” Singerer adds. And Elin has found his way. It's amazing. We are very proud.”

"It was Saturday morning. Mary left her house with twenty dollars in her pocket and a spirit full of optimism. He had spent the night before in front of his TV watching a reality show that followed lucky people who had found incredible things in their local second-hand stores. All these people had bought seemingly ordinary items at extremely low prices, and ended up discovering that their items were actually very valuable treasures. After having spent five consecutive hours watching other people's experiences, Mary was determined to give a chance to hunt in return in the hope of finding something that would make her rich.

One of his favorite stories about the show was a man who had bought a copy of the Declaration of Independence thinking it was a cheap replica, for just $2. He ended up discovering that the impression was actually one of the 200 official copies of the Declaration of Independence commissioned by John Quincy Adams in 1820. The man ended up earning $477,650 after selling it.
When Maria entered her local second-hand shop, she tried to remember what all the people on the reality show had looked for. The most common items of which people got rich were paintings and therefore headed straight for the home decoration hallway. Once there, I couldn't decide which one was the most expensive. In fact, they all seemed pretty ugly to him. ""Excuse me,"" Mary told an old woman passing by. ""What painting do you think could make me richer?"" Confused, the old lady quickly pointed to one and left.
The painting that the old lady had pointed out was of a cat collage with almost 20 different cat faces fluttered one over the other. ""It's definitely not my first choice,"" Mary thought. However, he trusted the fate decision and bought the painting for five dollars. After putting it online, she began to receive dozens of emails asking if the picture frame shown came with the painting. To see what the whole buzz about the frame was all about, he took it to an antique shop and asked if there was anything special in the frame. ""Of course, it's special!"" commented the clerk of the shop. ""His wood and his age make it at least $25,000!"" Mary ended up selling the frame for $30,000. A few days later, the buyer returned the ugly painting by mail.",B1

"One of the favorite American parties is Christmas. The party has a special meaning for most Americans today. It is an official government holiday held on December 25. Most Americans get both Christmas Day and Christmas Eve from their jobs so they can spend time with their families. Many people are busy buying gifts for their loved ones in preparation for the big day. Christmas Day is the time when families open the gifts that have been given. Gifts are wrapped in beautiful paper, and usually include a colorful bow and a label with a person's name on it. These gifts are placed under a tree that is brought home and decorated with bright ornaments throughout the family.

When Michelle was a little girl, she loved helping her parents decorate the Christmas tree. It all began by going to a lot of Christmas trees, where sellers sold freshly cut trees to the public. Families can walk through the lots to pick up the tree that is suitable for them. Michelle loved to go buy a tree for the sweet aroma that came from the trees. ""I like this one, Dad,"" Michelle said. ""It's perfect,"" his father accepted and bought the tree. It was the right size, with full green branches.
Once the tree was brought home, Michelle helped her mother put the tree in the right place, and started decorating it. His brothers and sister would also help. This was always a great family tradition. They put a series of flashing lights around the tree, along with beautiful ornaments of different types. Each member of the family was able to place their own special ornament on the tree just where they wanted it. The colors blue, red, yellow and red flashed and went out and glowed brightly, reflecting on the ornaments. While the family stood up and saw the decorated tree, they all smiled. Michelle turned to her father and said, ""Thank you, Dad.""",B1
"Chicago is known as the Victoria City. Some people think this is because of the breeze that blows almost constantly. The city is located in the state of Illinois on the shore of one of the Great Lakes, Lake Michigan, which is the fifth largest freshwater body in the world. Chicago can also be called the windy city due to the wind tunnel effect created in the center by many tall buildings.

The skyscrapers are an important part of Chicago's history. The first skyscraper in the United States was built in the city in 1884. With only 10 stories, it was impressive for his time. The skycraper was finally demolished. Chicago is home to other famous scoops. It was the birthplace of the refrigerated train, mail order catalogues, car radio, TV remote control, the first wheel, the first steel railroad, the first planetarium in the Western Hemisphere. Chicago is also home to the first blood bank and first entry bank. It is also home to The Lincoln Park Zoo, the oldest public zoo in the United States.Perhaps the windy city should be called the city of firstfruits.
Chicago is the third most populous city in the United States, after New York and Los Angeles. A little over two and a half million people live in the city that has more than 100 neighborhoods. President Barack Obama lived in Chicago.
Almost 40 million people visit Chicago every year. Many of them visit the Willis Tower. Formally known as the Sears Tower, it is the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere. It takes only a minute to reach the 103 Skydeck floor thanks to some of the fastest lifts in the world. From Skydeck visitors can see four states: Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin.",B1
"Driving in the United States can be confused not only by all the rules and laws that drivers must follow, but also by driving habits. Many people in the U.S. They really depend on their cars to get to work and school. In fact, most American workers spend an hour driving to work every day. In order to drive in the U.S., you have to go to your local motor vehicle department first, and take a written test to get your apprenticeship permit. If you pass this test, you can practice driving so you can pass a road test and get your license. The Department of Motor Vehicles or DMV has free brochures that you can go and get to study for your apprenticeship permit. You can also access the information online and even take a practical written exam. To prepare for the road test, you can have a friend teach you how to drive or pay to take classes at a driving school. However, you cannot practice driving on your own. If you get caught driving with just an apprenticeship permit, you can get in trouble with the law.

Once you get your driver's license in a state, you can use it to drive all over the United States. Wherever you drive, you will see signs placed along the road indicating the speed limit. These numbers are not a suggestion. You can usually drive faster on a road than on local streets. Local police use special equipment to detect their speed. If they find you're speeding or driving above the speed limit, the police can stop you and give you a ticket. You will have to pay a fine, and some of the fines are over $100. The lines painted on the road are not just to keep the cars in their lanes. They send a message. For example, a double solid yellow line means that it is against the law to pass another car here. Pass another car here.

"Many American basketball fans would argue that Michael Jordan is by far the best player in history to play at the National Basketball Association. The professional basketball league has existed since 1947, and there have been many individual players who have excelled in the game. Players like Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul Jabbar and Jerry West had left their mark in the league long before Jordan played the game.

No doubt Jordan had a big impact on the game mainly during his years playing with the Chicago Bulls. Jordan led the team to six championship finals, winning all six during the 1990s. Its legend is firmly grounded in the history of the great city, and many fans feel it has no equal. It is difficult to argue against Jordan in light of its success in all the titles it achieved, but basketball is a team sport, and winning a championship needs a team effort. There have been countless superstars who played in the league who didn't have good teammates, and never won a title. Chamberlain falls into that category.
Chamberlain won two NBA titles in his career, but no one in the game dominated him as he did. He has several league records, one of which is that he is the only player to score 100 points in a single game. However, when Chamberlain played the game, the NBA was not as big as in the 1990s. During the 1990s, the league enjoyed much greater popularity among American viewers, and much of this can be attributed to Michael Jordan's greatness. Jordan brought a style of play that had rarely been seen in the NBA. He won many individual awards during his career. He played his last seasons as a member of Washington's bullets.",B1
"In January I spent three weeks volunteering as an English teacher in my city. I've been thinking about becoming an English teacher for a while, so it was a good opportunity to see how it is. Students had just arrived to start a new life in the UK and had a range of levels from beginner to intermediate. They came from a variety of countries and had very different backgrounds and experiences.
For me, the most important thing was the relationship with the students. At first I was nervous and I didn't feel sure to talk in front of people. However, I found it easy to build good relationships with students as a class and as individuals and soon relaxed with them. It was a challenge to encourage lower-level students to speak English, but at least they understood much more at the end of the course.
At first, lesson planning took a long time and was not happy with the results. Classes seemed too difficult for some students and too easy for others, who quickly ended and got bored. I found it better to teach without a course book, adapting the materials I found online to suit your needs. I learned to take additional activities for students who finished early and that was much better.
I still have to keep improving my lesson planning. I would like to have more ideas to teach mixed skill groups and want to better plan the whole course next time. That way students have a focus on each lesson and a sense of progress and what they have covered. I will also make students safer with beginners when working in pairs so that conversational activities give everyone more opportunity to talk and students can help each other.
Overall, it was a very positive experience and I learned a lot. I've decided I'd like to be an English teacher in the future.",B1
"There was a march through Boyle Heights neighborhood in Los Angeles. The march was sponsored by a coalition of local organizations and agencies. The purpose of the march was to raise awareness of violence in the community. Many people have been killed because of gun violence and other crimes.

The march began at 9 a.m. in a crowded corner. Many parents brought their children to the march. The crowd began to walk along the sidewalks of the neighborhood. Occasionally the crowd stopped, and an organizer who used a megaphone told the story of a person who was killed. After the organizer told the story, there would be a prayer followed by a moment of silence. There were relatives of people who had been killed participating in the march. Some of these relatives left candles, balloons, or flowers in remembrance of the people who died. A woman who died was found at Hollenbeck Park Lake. The police suspect her boyfriend killed her. I had a little daughter. Her ex-husband participated in the march and asked the organizers to include her in their prayers.
The march continued for 20 blocks, and ended in Wabash Park. While the march was bleak, the atmosphere inside the park was more celebratory. Different organizations had booths with information about local programs. There was a craft table for the children to draw the kind of neighborhood they wanted to live in. Different bands played among speakers offering solutions to neighborhood problems.
The same day there was another march on a nearby housing project. In the spring, four houses were bombed. The police suspect that the attacks were racially motivated. The organizers planned to celebrate the march again next year. They really expected conditions in the neighborhood to improve so they wouldn't have to leave, though.",B1
"Clay Cockrell is sitting in his office in Columbus Circle, opposite 1 Central Park West, which houses the Trump International Hotel and Tower. In front of the tower is Central Park, where Cockrell holds his popular walking sessions and conversation therapy.
Cockrell, a former Wall Street worker who has become a therapist, spends most of his days walking through Central Park or Battery Park in downtown Manhattan, near Wall Street, as a confidant and advisor to some of New York's richest people.
“I turned to her naturally,” he said, becoming an expert in wealth therapy. “Many of the extremely rich – 1% of 1% – feel that their problems are not really problems. But they are. Many therapists do not give enough weight to their problems.”
So what problems is 1% of the United States struggling with? “There’s guilt for being rich in the first place,” he said. “There is a feeling that they have to hide the fact that they are rich. And then there is the isolation: being in 1%, it turns out that it can be lonely.” It seems that F Scott Fitzgerald was right: the very rich “are different from you and me.”
Councillors argue that things have gotten worse since the financial crisis and the debate about income inequality that have driven movements like Occupy Wall Street and the $15 campaign to fight for a fair wage.
“The Occupy Wall Street movement was good and had some important things to say about income inequality, but it pointed to 1% and painted them globally as negative,” said Jamie Traeger-Muney, wealth psychologist and founder of the Legacy Group of Wealth. The media, he said, are partly guilty of making the rich “feel like they need to hide or feel ashamed.”
“Sometimes, I’m surprised by the things people say. You would never refer to another group of people in the way that it seems perfectly normal to refer to wealth holders.”
“It’s really isolating having a lot of money. People’s reactions to you can be terrifying,” said Barbara Nusbaum, an expert in money psychology. “We are all taught not to talk about money. It's not polite to talk about money. Ironically, it's harder to talk about having money than talking about not having money. It is much more socially acceptable to say 'I am broken. Things are hard. You can't say 'I have a lot of money'. You have to keep a big part of your private life.”
As a result, Cockrell points out, the rich tend to go out with other rich Americans, not for snobbery, but to be close to those who understand them and their problems.
The widening gap between rich and poor is a global phenomenon. According to Oxfam, the richest 1% has seen their share of world wealth increase from 44% in 2009 to 48% in 2014 and is on track to own more than 99% by 2016.
In the US, in the last three decades, wealth owned by the top 0.1% households increased from 7% to 22%, even when wealth from the poorest 90% of households declined.
The number of extremely rich people has also increased. According to an investigation by the Spectrem Group, in 2014, the number of U.S. households with assets of $1 million or more (excluding the value of their primary housing) increased by $500,000 to $10.1 million. In 2007, that number was 9.2 million. Households worth $5 million or more reached 1.3 million and 142,000 households are now worth $25 million or more.
Since the 2008 financial crisis, the income gap has expanded and the situation “has worsened for the rich,” Cockrell said. The main reason? Not knowing if your friends are friends of yours or your money.
“Someone else who is also a billionaire – they don’t want anything from you. Never be able to trust your friends with people from different media, I think that’s hard,” Cockrell said. “As the gap has widened, the rich have become increasingly isolated.”
These are real fears faced by the richest of the rich. In 2007, the Gates Foundation partnered with the Boston College Center for Wealth and Philanthropy to document what it felt like to be in 1% of the United States. Over the next four years, researchers surveyed 165 of the richest households in the United States: 120 of those households have at least $25 million in assets. The average net value of respondents was $78 million. The resulting study, The Joys and Dilemmas of Wealth, was 500 pages long and seemed to prove the old adage that money cannot buy happiness.
“Wealth can be a barrier to connecting with other people,” confessed a spouse of a technology entrepreneur who earned about $80 million. Some Americans have taken to keep their wealth secret. “We speak of it as stealthy wealth. There are many people who are hiding their wealth because they are concerned about the negative judgment,” said Traeger-Muney. If rich Americans talk about the unique challenges that come with their wealth, people often discard their experience.
""People say 'Oh, poor you.' There’s not much sympathy there,” he said. “Wealth remains one of our last taboos.”
Speaking in his soft, soothing voice that makes you want to spill all your worries, Cockrell said that a common mistake many of his rich customers make is to let their money define them.
“I don’t think it’s healthy to rule out your problems. If you are part of 1%, you still have problems and are legitimate for you. Even when you say, 'I don't have to fight for money,' there are other parts of your life. Money is not the only thing that defines you,” he said. Your problems are legitimate.

"He was the best tennis player in Japan.
And Roger Federer. Even now, even though I love watching him play I think he's really the tennis history champion.
"" Project 45 ""
Nishikori's rise saw a wave of optimism that he could be a pioneer of tennis, hence Project 45hype while leaning toward usurpation of Matsuoka's ranking.
Project 45 wasn't a pressure on me -- I was just playing tennis for my hobby, he said.
My first goal after becoming a professional was to enter the top 100 and then be 45 years old. It was one of my goals to be the number one tennis player in Japan, and now I'm at No. 11 in the world.
Reaching the top 10 is my next target. It won't be easy to get there -- hopefully this year -- but I'm getting closer.
State of the rock star
Like Matsuoka, Nishikori has come to understand what it means to be the only representative of Japan in the top 120: fame and worship.
Like Andy Murray, who has had to carry the hopes of the United Kingdom on his shoulders, Nishikori has the same weight of responsibility, but responds to twice the number of people.
I return to Japan about three or four times a year, he explained. I have to go back to my hometown and, yes, people recognize me on the streets.
Sometimes it's not easy; you can't relax, but at the same time I try to enjoy the moment. Not many people can feel that way. I love staying in Japan, I really enjoy it when I get back.
Not for a second do you regret the accessories that your success in the game has delivered. He's just a good-looking guy from Shimane acting his hobby on the global stage.
For me, playing tennis was always my hobby, I'm a lucky guy, he said.
It was something I loved. It's something that can drive you crazy or crazy sometimes, but it's something you love and not many kids can do your job.
I'm trying to enjoy this moment and this life... it's not gonna be long, 10 to 20 years, so I'm gonna work hard.

"Laura was confused. He came to the United States a year ago. I didn't understand the difference between Memorial Day and Veterans' Day. I knew that both parties had to do with remembering and honoring the people who had fought in wars for the United States. I also knew that both days were national holidays. On both days the banks, schools and post offices were closed; on both holidays, the shops offered special sales; on both holidays, people hung the American flag, and sometimes even there were fireworks. Laura had seen on television that on both days the President of the United States gave a speech and visited a cemetery placing a crown in the grave of a soldier. Laura decided to ask the postman Brian what the difference was. She thought he'd know since he had two days off from work.

The next day, when Brian was leaving Laura's mail, she asked him. Brian explained that Memorial Day is generally observed on the last Monday in May. This meant that it could be on a different date every year. The commemorative day is a day to remember and honor the soldiers who died, especially if they died in a battle. Brian also told Laura that Memorial Day was also considered the unofficial start of summer. Many public beaches would open on Memory Day. Veterans' Day is a day reserved to thank and honor all the people who served in the U.S. Army. Brian explained that Veterans Day is also to remember those who are still alive. Brian told Laura that Veterans Day's date never changes. It is always celebrated on November 11, which was the date when World War I ended in 1918.",B1
"A wedding shower is a party when a woman who is about to get married is ""showed"" with gifts and good wishes. A future bride will often register in one or more department stores and create a list of things she would like people to give her as gifts. This makes it easy for guests of both the wedding shower and the wedding itself to know what kind of things the bride wants. A record also ensures that there are no duplicate gifts. A bride may want a blender, but she certainly doesn't want to get three and has to deal with the hassle of returning extras. Most wedding shower gifts are items a newly married couple needs to start their life together. These gifts include dishes, pots, pans and even appliances such as toasters and microwave ovens. Many brides also expect to receive some money. Cash or cheques are considered appropriate gifts for a wedding shower. The money is useful to help pay for an expensive wedding. Sometimes people bring gifts of bad taste like lingerie to the nuptial showers. Some people think these gifts are good because they help the new couple ""spit"" their married life. Others find this kind of gift embarrassing.

While many nuptial showers are surprises, others are planned with the contribution of the future bride. A nuptial shower can be small and intimate and hold in someone's house. It can also be a bigger affair held in a restaurant or catering room. Appetizers and desserts are sometimes served or a full meal can be offered. Traditionally, nuptial showers were only women's affairs. However, more and more showers are not co-ed, with men and women. Traditionally men are not invited to the nuptial showers, but now more showers include men and groom-to-be. Like many parties in the United States, there would be no dancing in the bridal shower, just eating and people chatting. Some wedding showers even have games.",B1

"The Taj Mahal
The Taj Mahal is a famous mausoleum located next to the Yamuna River in the Indian city of Agra. A mausoleum is a building where people bury the dead. The name Taj Mahal means ""the crown of palaces"".
1.
The most famous part of the Taj Mahal is the large white dome in the center. It is 35 meters high and is surrounded by four smaller domes. The rooms inside the building are decorated with beautiful arches and precious stones on the walls. The buildings are surrounded by gardens with trails, swimming pools, fountains and green gardens.
2.
The construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 and ended in 1653. It was built with materials from all over India and Asia, but the main material is white marble. Historians believe that the materials were transported by more than 1,000 elephants for construction.
3.
Emperor Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal as a burial place for his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. According to legend, I wanted to build another Taj Mahal in black across the river, but this never happened. During the Indian rebellion of 1857, many parts of the Taj Mahal were damaged by British soldiers, who took some of the precious stones from their walls. Over the years, the Taj Mahal has suffered environmental damage, and there have been many attempts by the government to preserve its beauty.

The Taj Mahal is one of the most famous monuments in India. There are millions of visitors to the mausoleum every year. The Taj Mahal is almost always included in the lists of famous buildings to visit and is considered one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. It is also a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

"Hurricane Bertha, the first hurricane in the 2008 Atlantic season, increased in strength on Monday night, according to the National Hurricane Center.
A satellite photo from 5:45 a.m. Monday ET shows Hurricane Bertha over the Atlantic.
While Bertha's power may fluctuate over the next day, it is expected to gradually begin to weaken by Wednesday, 11 p.m. downtown. ET's advisor said.
Bertha became a major hurricane -- or category 3 -- on Monday afternoon. A category 3 has wind speeds of 111 to 130 mph.
11 p.m. ET, Bertha was 695 miles - LRB- 1,115 km -RRB- east-north-east of the North Leeward Islands and about 1,085 miles -LRB- 1,745 km -RRB- south-east of Bermuda. The eye was moving west-northwest at about 12 miles an hour. Its maximum sustained winds were recorded at 120 mph - LRB- 195 km/h -RRB-, from the 115 mph mentioned in a warning at 5 p.m.
The hurricane is expected to turn northwest and slow down in the next 24 to 48 hours, the center said.
There is a very small possibility that Bertha will reach the United States. Bermuda could be affected by the hurricane this weekend. See Bertha's projected path
It is still too early to determine whether Bertha will affect Bermuda or not, the center said.
The storm formed on Thursday at the eastern end of the Atlantic, off the coast of Africa, near the southern Cape Verde Islands. It was strengthened into a hurricane early Monday. More information about hurricanes

"During the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, Germany, Chancellor Adolf Hitler promised to use the games to show Aryan superiority to the rest of the world. Hitler was convinced that the white Aryan man was part of the higher race, and promised that his games would prove this superiority on the Olympic scene. American athlete James ""Jesse"" Owens, had a different idea.

Owens was an excellent athlete at Ohio State University during the 1930s. During a track encounter in 1935, Owens set three world records, and tied another, in what has been called ""the best 45 minutes in sports"". Although Owens found great success in his athletic career, he grew up for a time in the United States where Black people were still highly discriminated against. The segregation laws were still in force in many parts of the country, and Owens felt this prejudice directly. He could not stay in the same hotel rooms as his white companions, nor was he allowed to eat in the same restaurants. Ironically, Owens was treated better during his time in the 36 Olympics in Germany.
During the games, Hitler got angry because Owens was winning so many gold medals. Owens was proving that Hitler's racist claims and rhetoric were false. Hitler didn't like it. Owens ended up winning four gold medals in these games. Hitler refused to shake his hand. One of the defining moments of the games is when Owens was a friend of German athlete Luz Long. Owens appreciated his friendship with Long, especially because he knew Long could fall out of favor with Hitler's brutal regime.
Many German fans shook Owen's hands, although Hitler did not, but when Owens returned to the United States, he found that he had not changed much there.",B1
"One of the greatest tragedies in the world was the sinking of the Titanic luxury line. Although it was a British ship, many Americans were on board during the terrible night of April 15, 1912. The ship was on its inaugural journey that night when it hit an iceberg in the deep waters of the North Atlantic Ocean. The ship was en route to New York City from Southampton, UK when it arrived at the iceberg, killing more than 1,500 of the 2,224 passengers. The ship was the largest ship ever built until that date, and it was thought to be insumable.

Ship passengers ranged from some of the richest people in the world at the time, to thousands of immigrant workers who were trying to find work in the United States. The Titanic was equipped with technological security features such as remote-controlled watertight doors and watertight compartments, but did not carry enough lifeboats for all passengers. Due to the immense size of the ship, it was thought to be insumable, a fact that contributed to the small number of lifeboats carried on the ship. In addition, many of the lifeboats were not filled to their capacity when they were launched, causing further loss of life.
Most of the dead that night were men. The protocol followed by the ship's officers required ""women and children first,"" when lifeboats were loaded. The accident was affected by international shock and pain. Many of today's maritime rules have been established because of this disaster. Only 705 passengers floating in lifeboats were saved that night. The ship broke in two parts before sinking. It's more than a mile deep in the North Atlantic. The sinking of Titanic has been documented in cinema and literature over the years.",B1
"Apples don't grow in New York, so that's not why it's called the Big Apple. There are many legends about how the city that never sleeps got its name. One story says that a famous brothel owner named Eve gave the city his name. Another version of the story claims that the name has its roots in show business with artists calling New York the ""Big Apple"" as it was the best place to be noticed. There is a legend that the city received its name due to the large number of unemployed who sold apples on the streets of New York City during the Great Depression.

The most likely term has its roots in horse racing in the 1920s. The awards were called ""apples"" and a newspaper reporter when writing about the races used to call the big prize the big apple. In fact, the ""big apple"" was soon used to mean any big city. In the late 1920s until the 1940s, ""The Big Apple"" wasn't just a nickname for New York, it was also the name of a song, a dance, and a place to dance and sing. New York was the heart of the jazz musical scene in the 1930s and 1940s. In Harlem, Manhattan, there was a club called The Big Apple. There was also a short film of the same name from 1938 with black jazz musicians and dancers.
In the 1970s, the city's tourism agency began to use the term ""Big Apple"" on purpose. There's even a corner in Manhattan called Big Apple Corner. A New York City baseball team, the Mets of New York, have a big red apple coming out every time the Mets hit a home run in their Citifield stadium. Although the origins of the nickname ""Big Apple"" are unclear, it seems to be here to stay.",B1
"Molly Haskell will always have brotherly love for Ellen Hampton. After all, Hampton was once named John Cheves Haskell Jr. and used to be Haskell's brother.
Until 2005, Hampton lived as John -- or, as his family called him, Chevey. That year, she told her sister that she had been living with gender dysphoria, which the American Psychiatric Association defines as a marked inconsistency between experienced/expressed gender and assigned sex.
This was my 59-year-old brother, Haskell said of the revelation in a phone interview. It had been a little boy, and all my memories had been of a boy. It makes you go through your whole past.
Haskell details the experience with a critical but compassionate eye in his latest book, My Brother My Sister.
At the time of the announcement, Chevey was married to a woman, Eleanor, and a loving stepfather with his two children.
Hampton, now divorced, lives as a heterosexual woman after gender reassignment and facial reconstruction surgeries, hormone therapy, and a wardrobe review.
Haskell recently talked to CNN about his own family and emotional journey with his transgender brother. The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.
CNN: Obviously you've reached an agreement with Ellen's decision. What took you for your part?
Haskell: First of all, I realized very soon that it is very overwhelming. I knew I could never say not to do this.My brother would never have hurt anyone, so he really told me how powerful feeling was. Seeing her go through it and evolve -- not only was she radiantly happy, but she was completely in front of her. Seeing how he handled it -- I'd talk about it if people wanted to -- he showed me that this was meant to be.
CNN: However, you write frankly about having unexpected anxiety about the news.
Haskell: I was afraid for her. I was shocked that this was happening. There was shock and apprehension. I had been in favor of more diversity, and the challenging binary roles for male and female behavior, but somehow I didn't include my brother changing sex.
The only thing is that we're born men or women, and we need those boundaries to rub against. I think one interesting thing a feminist told me is that I seem to embrace these binary principles in the book. I think there is such a thing as a man and a woman; we need these dichotomyes, like good and evil. We make these divisions to keep us standing in the world.
The sex we are born is not immutable, and that is very difficult to understand. You really can't call his decision a choice. It's too painful, too dangerous, it has to be an impulse that we don't even have a word for.
CNN: What was your part of Ellen's trip?
Haskell: I think many people who are transsexuals emphasize the strangeness of all this. For example, the director of The Matrix Larry Wachowski, now Lana Wachowski, has this wild red hair. My sister's not like that. This book is an attempt to unmask the whole subject. I think it's more puzzling for people when the person seems so normal, but I think we have to remember that they're not many people.
So many changes, but much doesn't change. You can take hormones to change this, operate to change that, but you can't change your voice, hair, love... there's a core of yourself that doesn't change.
CNN: How was it different to have a sister instead of a brother?
Haskell: It's wonderful. It's like I've been given two for the price of one. We have differences... it takes so long to get dressed! We're a lot closer than we've ever been. It is difficult to say that change has not made her happier.
At first I thought I was losing a brother. It was like a penalty, a death. But your happiness is crucial. It's more open, more gregarious. I think my mother would have been very, very upset but, in a funny way, Ellen is the kind of person my mother wanted me to be Chevey.
CNN: How was it different from 59 years old than it could have been before?
Haskell: I think the reason he didn't do it before is because there was no acceptance. Why is this happening so much now? Because he can. There's a word for it, and there's people doing it. This submerged desire finally had a means of being released.
CNN: Having Ellen in your life took some adjustments, even in small areas like the right language, right?
Haskell: The first time we went out in public, I was very aware of myself and nervous. We went to dinner at a fancy restaurant and the waiter asked us how we liked our food. I said mine's good, but yours is fabulous. She - LRB- Ellen -RRB - smiled and I smiled.
I often called her Chevey by mistake when it was just the two of us. And on the phone, the voice is a huge thing that's not improvizable. There's no good surgery. When she gets on the phone, I'd see her as Chevey, my brother.
Recently, however, I have stopped doing that. It's automatically Ellen.
Ellen initially didn't want you to write the book, but then she changed her mind. Why?
Haskell: She wanted to have this book when she was fighting with him. I wanted it to be your book as much as my book. I think of it as a society.

"With the deployment of HealthCare.gov -- the portal for registration in Obamacare's new health-care exchanges -- being beaten by critics and users, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta sat down with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius for an exclusive interview.
Here are Gupta's conclusions from the interview:
1. Full speed ahead
I was surprised to learn how extensive the concerns were before the launch of October 1. Congressional researchers claim that just weeks before the planned start-up, more than two-thirds of the insurers had concerns that the system would be viable by October 1. A few days before the launch, the website crashed while testing with just a few hundred people entering, according to the Washington Post.
Despite all that, the White House decided to move forward. When I pressed Sebelius on this point, she said, “We advance because millions of people have been waiting for health insurance, and they don’t want to delay any longer.
Sebelius at the Obamacare launch event
She said it a few times: A few weeks didn't make that much difference since open enrollment lasts until the end of March, and millions more people could have health insurance by that time.
2. Didn't Obama know?
According to Sebelius, President Barack Obama was not aware of any significant problems until a couple of days after the website had been launched.
The Affordable Care Act is promoted as a signing achievement for the Obama administration, and I was surprised that the President was not being kept up to date -- according to Sebelius -- on concerns about deployment.
Sebelius: Obamacare troubleshooting website Blind President
3. Team Late to arrive
Sebelius said that for the website to run smoothly, she has asked contractors to bring her best and brightest, her A-Team. I was surprised that the A-Team had not been assembled before, given the magnitude of the ACA, and the challenge of establishing the website.
When I pressed the Secretary on this point, she simply said she wants new eyes and ears, and put all her hands on deck, working toward a solution as quickly as possible.
4. Open to dilatory fines?
Sebelius did not back down on the individual mandate, which requires people to have health insurance or pay a fine.
I asked how it was possible that people could face a fine, if they had tried to register and had not succeeded. At that point, it seems that she may have left the window open to a delay, saying only: I don't think that's really the question right now.
The problem is whether people will be able to enroll for affordable health care in the six-month open enrollment period? And I think the answer is absolutely yes.
It is not clear whether this question is raised again or not. For now, the Secretary said that the individual mandate is here to stay.
Administration to initiate the effort to promote registration
5. Falling on his sword?
Finally, I asked him about the calls for his resignation. In recent days, his friend, Senator Pat Roberts, as well as the Republican vice presidential candidate, Representative Paul Ryan, have raised the possibility.
Although not decisive, Sebelius again reinforced the mission of this task, saying it was the most important work he had ever had. He also reinforced that he served at the President's pleasure.

"The original World Trade Center opened in New York in 1973. The most famous part of the building complex was the Twin Towers. They were named because there was almost exactly the same thing. The only difference is that one had a high antenna on top.

When they were built, the 1,368-foot tall buildings were the highest in the world. Such tall buildings needed a way for people to travel in them. The towers had 95 lifts in total. Visitors used to travel to the 107th and 110th floors, where there were observation decks from which you could see the whole city and New Jersey. Inside there were offices, shops, a hotel, and on the top floor of one of the towers there was a restaurant called ""Windows on the World"". The restaurant even organized a salsa night on Thursdays. A series of subway lines ran under the towers. The World Trade Center Complex, with a total of seven buildings, was so large that it had its own zip code. In 1974 a Frenchman walked a loose rope between the twin towers.
The World Trade Center survived a bombing in 1993. The horizon and spirit of New York City were changed after September 11, 2001. That morning, two planes crashed into the World Trade Center in central Manhattan. At first the upper floors of the buildings were on fire. Soon they collapsed, covering the lower part of Manhattan with hot metal and ash. A total of 2,753 people died. For weeks the air smelled of burnt metal and plastic. It took eight months for the site to be cleaned. Years later, the World Trade Center is rebuilding. There's a new tower, called the Tower of Freedom. There is also a monument and a museum to honor those who died in the 2001 attack.",B1
"The Beatles are a group of English musicians from Liverpool, England. He took America for the storm with his appearance on Ed Sullivan's first-hour television show. The group's first appearance was seen by more than 73 million viewers in February 1964, presenting the band to the American people. In the following months, the band became the largest rock band ‘N’ Roll in history in the United States.

The group's success opened the door for other British bands to go to America. Bands like The Rolling Stones, The Who, The Kinks and The Dave Clark Five soon played their music for the American public.
The Beatles were formed by four of the best musicians who played rock music. His lead singer was Paul McCartney, and drummer Ringo Starr. Both still play to this day. Two of the original members, singers and composers, John Lennon, and George Harrison, have died tragically, but their music lives in American culture to this day. The Beatles have sold more records in the United States than any other country in the world.
There was controversy in the United States before the first appearance of the group. American conservatives regarded the Beatles as an adventitious, brazen, new ideas, lyrics, and sound. The young generation of the time was ready for change, and the Beatles gave them what they wanted. The ""Mop Tops"" were nicknamed because of their long bowl-like haircuts that flew on the face of the convention in the 1960s. But nothing was going to stop the Beatles. His music is as popular today as it was 50 years ago. This February, the Grammy Awards aired a special broadcast to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the group's first appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show.",B1
"In Los Angeles, places associated with death are often popular. One of those popular places is the Department of Forensics. When someone dies and the cause of death is indeterminate or suspicious, the body is brought here for examination. It's the coroner's job to determine the time, cause and form of death. Sometimes the coroner will have to perform an autopsy, which is like an operation on a corpse to try to figure out how the person died. One of the reasons L.A.'s coroner's office is so popular is because of the number of famous people who have been examined there. Some of these people include Marilyn Monroe, Robert F. Kennedy, Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston.

The L.A. Coroner's office is so popular that there's even a gift shop where visitors can buy items like shirts, caps and cups with the coroner's logo. A T-shirt that people can buy even says, ""Our work bodies speak for themselves."" They even sell beach towels with body contours. The store is open five days a week. They also have a website and a paper catalog for those who are not close enough to visit. The coroner's office claims that the purpose of the store is to tell people how fragile life is and to create awareness and responsibility for one's actions. Some people feel that having a shop in the same place where the dead are is disrespectful.
There's been a series of TV shows about the LA coroner's office. Some of these are reality TV shows with what workers really do there. An example is called ""Death Detectives."" Other programs are fictional like ""Quincy M.E."" The coroner. means a forensic doctor, the person who performs the autopsies.",B1
"Boston is the capital of Massachusetts. It is the largest city in the state of New England and is rich in history. That's why more than 12 million people visit the city every year. It is a very ancient city, founded in 1630 by English settlers fleeing religious persecution. The American Revolution, when settlers, known as patriots, fought for their independence from the British, began in Boston with the battle of Lexington. Other key events of the revolution took place in the city. One was the Boston Massacre, when British troops shot at protesters, killing five. The Boston Tea Party, when settlers threw a whole shipment of British tea into the port to protest against taxes, was not a party at all. Paul Revere's ""night trip,"" where he warned settlers of British troops approaching, also occurred in Boston. Many of these sites can be accessed by taking a walk through the ""Trail of Freedom"", a red line of bricks embedded on the ground across the city.
Boston is also a city of notable firstfruits. The first public school in the United States was founded in Boston in 1635. Boston Common, where British troops camped during the American Revolution and where the first settlers hung people, is the oldest public park in the United States. Boston is also home to the oldest subway system in the United States.
Like many cities in the United States, immigrants played an important role in their development. Irish immigrants who settled in Boston, for example, played an important role in local and national politics. Boston also has a large and active Puerto Rican community and an Italian community. President John F. Kennedy and his family have ties to Boston.
Boston is also well known for many schools and universities around it. Some of the most famous are Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Boston attracts more than 350,000 college students from all over the world.",B1
"In the era of social media, it is not necessary to be at a party to enjoy smart or catty comments about the Super Bowl.
Twitter turned on Sunday night with comments on every conceivable aspect of Super Bowl XLVI, from Patriotstight end Rob Gronkowski's balky ankle to Madonna's acrobatic half-time show for all those commercials.

Two... one... impeller ignition... and Discovery's final takeoff.
CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Of course, we'll have more on that for you on today's show, but we're getting off the ground in North Africa. My name is Carl Azuz. CNN student news starts right now!
First: Rest in Libya
AZUZ: There are approximately 6,000 Americans in Libya, and the U.S. government is trying to get them out. A ferry that was chartered to take hundreds of U.S. citizens from Libya to Malta was held for a while yesterday. U.S. officials said everyone on board was safe. They said the delay was for time.
Meanwhile, Libya's leader, Moammar Gadhafi, is blaming youth for violence in his country. He says they're taking some kind of pills and being manipulated by the Al Qaeda terrorist group. But during a speech earlier this week, President Obama said that what is happening in that part of the world has nothing to do with external influences.
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: So let me be clear. The change taking place throughout the region is being driven by the population of the region. This change does not represent the work of the United States or any foreign power. It represents the aspirations of people seeking a better life.
Political rest
AZUZ: Looking around that region, starting with Libya in Algeria. The country has lifted a 19-year-old state of emergency, and what that means is that people there have greater freedom of expression and assembly now. Moving south to Cameroon, where protesters are demanding that the country's president withdraw. He's been in power for almost 30 years and is running for reelection this year. Finally, Yemen, where eight legislators resigned to protest against violence against people who protest against the government. One of the legislators said I resigned because the government has not respected human rights.
Is this legal?
JOHN LISK, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? The Discovery Space Shuttle is named after sailboats. This is the truth! The ferry is named after two ships that explored the world.
Final mission
AZUZ: The Discovery space shuttle has made more space travel than any other ship. All together, the shuttle has spent almost a full year orbiting the Earth. Yesterday, Discovery left on his 39th and last mission, delivering equipment to the international space station. This was the first release of Discovery, in 1984. And these pitches aren't cheap. NASA estimates that every time a shuttle takes off, it costs almost $500 million. After Discovery's current mission, there are only two launches left for the space shuttle program.
Budgetary battle
AZUZ: We have been reporting on this controversial budget project in Wisconsin. You can review our transcript files for more details about that. It was expected to be put to the vote yesterday, but only in the House of State Representatives. Things aren't moving forward in the Wisconsin Senate. And that's because Democratic senators have left the state in an effort to try to block any vote on the bill. You can get the latest details about this situation at CNN.com.

TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Cry goes to Mr.Bozic's world geography class at Cypress Creek High School in Houston, Texas! Willie O'Ree was the first African-American to play in what sports league? Were the: A-RRB-MLB, B-RRB-NBA, C-RRB-NFL or D-RRB-NHL? You've got three seconds... Come on! Willie O'Ree made her debut in the National Hockey League in 1958. That's your answer and that's your cry!
Diversity in hockey
AZUZ: Willie O'Ree paved the way for other African-Americans to hit the NHL ice. As we continue our commemoration of Black History Month, we are taking a look at diversity at the Thrashersroster in Atlanta. Richelle Carey sat with the four African-Americans on the team to talk about life as a minority professional hockey player.
- LRB- BEGIN VIDEO- RRB-
I want each of you to tell me what you like about hockey. Sell me hockey! Sell me!
Hockey is the fastest and most physical sport there is.
JOHNNY ODUYA, TRASHERS DEFENSEMAN: Teamwork, too. I'd say a total package sport.
I like to skate fast, since I was three years old.
DUSTIN BYFUGLIEN, THRASHERS DEFENSEMAN: I guess it's something about being on the ice I enjoy. It's just me being out there, having fun and enjoying the people around me.
CAREY: What is the biggest mistake or false assumption that people make about you?
This guy can't stand on skates.
ODUYA: Maybe in Atlanta, tell people you're a hockey player and they don't believe you.
What do you think?
I don't know. Maybe basketball or baseball, I have no idea.
CAREY: Who here knew they were going to be a professional hockey player? Does anyone here know?
I probably knew it when I was in first grade. We had a mission to say what you wanted to be when you grew up. And I said, hockey player, and she said, ""Choose something else."" And I said, no, I'm gonna be a hockey player, and I stayed with him.
CAREY: Did anyone try to lead you to something different, because you don't look out on the ice that often and see people of color? Did anyone say this isn't right for you?
KANE: No, I think, honestly, it was almost the opposite. My father really instilled that urge in me to fight through that kind of thing, the battle through adversity, and that's what made me so successful.
CAREY: Does anyone else feel that they were directed in a different direction for racial reasons at all?
I grew up in an urban neighborhood and many of my friends play basketball and sports like that. I was gonna play some basketball, but after an hour I got bored of him, so I'd say, I have to go play hockey now. And they were, uh, naw, you're not gonna make it in hockey, so you could also play basketball or something. But I had some support from my parents. That helped me a lot. All my close friends to date were minor hockey players, and their support helped me get to where I am today.
CAREY: We always hear about hockey like, it's an expensive sport for kids who want to play. And often, perhaps, that's why minority children don't get into this. Explain to me, why is it so expensive?
STEWART: I think when you have to pay $500 for a pair of skates instead of a $20 basketball or a $50 pair of football shoes, it makes a lot more sense to play those sports. But there are many community initiatives right now in the NHL helping urban children. And with Hockey's program it's for everyone who's helping not to play so lucky kids, they're making good strides.

"Nobody's ever outdone Magic Johnson. Since he was young, Johnson has been known for his great attitude toward life. It just happens that Johnson is also one of the best basketball players who have played in the National Basketball Association. Johnson played his entire career for Los Angeles Lakers. The Lakers are the best franchise in the NBA in the last 40 years, having won more championships than any other team.

During the 1980s, the Lakers were known as ""Showtime"" due to the team's high-pace and high-scoring style of play. Much of this style can be attributed to the charismatic Johnson. His style developed at an early age when he played basketball in his home state of Michigan. He attended Michigan State University, and directed his team to the National Collegiate Association of Athletics (NCAA) degree in 1979.
He was taken by the Lakers as his first choice in the college draft, and he never left. Johnson played for the Lakers from 1980 to 1991, and then played for some games in 1996. During the 1980s, he took the Lakers to eight championship games, and won five. No other team had mastered the game in a single decade since the Boston Celtics in the 1960s. He also won an Olympic Gold Medal in basketball, and won the Most Valuable Player Awards several times, but his most lovable quality remained one of the most enjoyable and appreciated players in the game.
Today Johnson still calls L.A. his home. He's gone from basketball player to coach, to team owner and entrepreneur. He owns a successful movie franchise called Magic Johnson Theaters. Johnson was also part of the investment group that bought the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team in 2012. He is married and has two children and a daughter.",B1
"Parenting styles in the United States are often criticized. One type of parenting that is criticized is a father in a helicopter. These types of parents hang over their children like helicopters, which means that these parents are always on top of their children.

Although being a conscious and involved parent is not a bad thing, the helicopter's parents take him to the extreme. The actions of the parents of helicopters actually hurt the children by not teaching them to be responsible for their actions. For example, parents of a helicopter would call their adult college-age child to wake them up to go to class when part of the university is learning to be responsible and learn to manage their own time. The parents of the helicopters are also too concerned that their children will be injured. This means that the helicopter's parents retain their child's natural curiosity. Part of growing up means your child has to get hurt, physically and emotionally. This is how lessons are learned. Instead, the children of the parents of helicopters can grow up to be too needy and dependent adults. Some people blame the rise of helicopter rearing for the rise of cell phones. Mobile phones make it easy for parents to track their children all the time.
The opposite of the mother helicopter is the mother of free reach. The free-range mom follows a slow-rearing style, which means she lets her kids explore the world at their own pace with little direction. The free-range name comes from the idea that children should have the freedom to explore their world or rank in a way that makes sense to them. This often means that free-range moms will not schedule activities such as extra classes or play dates for their children. Instead, a free-range mother will let her child play in a park. There's less emphasis on things like the last toys.",B1
"When a film is to be released, the theater will usually show the film during a midnight screening. Anthony Baker and his girlfriend Linda Moore love watching new movies at midnight. A lot of people usually show up early to line up. Anthony likes to line up and talk to different people in line. Anthony told Linda about the new movie he was dating. Linda got online to buy the tickets. He wanted to make sure they got tickets.

Linda got an email from the theater. He said he could pick up the tickets at the theater. Anthony took Linda to lunch before he went to the theater to wait in line. Anthony was excited because the movie they were going to see was the sequel to one of Anthony's favorite movies. When they arrived at the theater, Anthony and Linda went to the back of the line and started talking to the people behind. Everyone seemed friendly, and some of them really knew Anthony and Linda.
After an hour of waiting in line, the theater began to let people in. Anthony hugged Linda and started jumping up and down. Linda loved going to the theater with Anthony. He looked like a little boy when he was there. She always put a smile on Linda's face. When they came in, Anthony and Linda found their seats. They realized that everyone in the theater started singing a song that came out in the first movie, so Anthony got up and started clapping and singing. Linda looked at Anthony and thought, ""It's a completely different experience to see a midnight screening.",B1
"Not all children's birthday parties in the U.S. They think they're the same. Sometimes it seems that birthday parties try to show and entertain the children's parents, in addition to the children.

Most of the children's birthday parties are held at the birthday boy's house. It used to be that children's parties were only for children. The parents left their children and returned when the party was over to bring them home. It is now more common for the parents of the guests to stay for the party as well. This gives adults time and space to socialize while children play. Children and adults do not always have the same taste in food. So when adults are invited to stay for a child's birthday party, there is usually more elegant food for adults such as cheese, biscuits and fruit dishes. Meanwhile, children eat hot dogs and chips. While children drink punch, juice, or soda, parents may be drinking cocktails, beer, or wine.
Entertainment for an adult and mixed children party also goes beyond the usual clown or magician. Sometimes there will be a DJ, and adults will dance. Party games aren't just for kids either. While children play traditional games such as fixing the tail on the donkey, adults can play casino games such as blackjack or poker.
Not everyone likes this trend of adults and kids partying together. Some consider that the parties should be kept separate. Some people worry about adults getting drunk in front of children. Others are concerned that children are abused by adults they do not know. For others, it is about allowing a child to have a special day. It is also concerned that these mixed parties foster a sense of competition between parents in a community.",B1
"For the past month Mark King had been receiving flyers by mail about a new superstore opening up in his neighborhood. The flyers mistook him. I've never heard the term superstore before. Later, he learned that a superstore is a large retail store that sells a variety of products, usually at discount prices. Sometimes superstores are also called big box stores. Many times they are chain stores owned by a company.

All the flyers had different messages about the opening of the superstore. A group of flyers invited him and others to apply for work at the store. The jobs paid well and even offered some benefits. Mark thought this was a good thing since he knew a lot of people were looking for work. Another set of flyers included coupons to be used on the opening day. The store had many bargains for common items such as paper towels, but also for large screen TVs. Mark thought this was a good thing too. It seemed like a good idea to be able to get a variety of things in one place instead of going from one store to another. I'd save time and money. Superstores could sell groceries and clothes under one roof.
Another set of flyers contradicted the positive messages about the superstore however. Some local residents were organizing a superstore protest. The flyers said the superstore was bad for the community because it threatened the business of the smaller shops in the area. Mark thought of Mr. Hernández who had a small grocery store on the block. That's where Mark bought staples like eggs and milk. I didn't want Mr. Hernández's shop shut down, but I also wanted to save money.",B1
"Section 8 is also called the housing option voucher program. Very poor families, the elderly and persons with disabilities can earn up to $2,000 a month to help pay rent in single-family homes and apartments. However, qualifying families do not receive a completely free ride. To qualify, you must be able to pay about 30 percent of the rent yourself. The rest of the rent is paid directly by the government to a landlord. Not all owners accept Section 8. If you qualify for Section 8, it is your responsibility to find an owner who accepts the program.

Eligibility for the program depends on your annual income and how many people are in your family. To qualify you have to be a U.S. citizen. or a legal resident of the U.S. If you are undocumented or have a tourist visa, you cannot apply for this program. As with all public housing programs, you will need to fill out an application to see if you qualify. In the application you will have to say how much money you make, how much money you have in the bank, and how many people are in your family. You'll have to prove how much you earn. The government will ask to speak to your boss, see your bank statements and proof that you pay taxes.
If you qualify, you'll probably be put on a waiting list. Section 8, like other public housing programmes, has many people applying for them. You might be waiting many years before you really get a voucher, which is like a coupon that says how much rent the government is willing to pay for you. If an owner accepts you and your Section 8 bonus, you still have to sign a rental agreement, or rental agreement.",B1
"Introduction
Did you know that, in the UK, there is no legal requirement for restaurants to convey advice to staff? It is a fact that is covered in a government-led review, published in May 2016, in which workers, employers and customers were asked their opinion about the tipping process. From behind, ministers said they were interested in changing the rules and making sure low-paid workers received the money left to them by grateful customers. The government has announced a two-month consultation on proposals that said they would end injustice.
Among the revelations of the review was the fact that some waiters charge up to 15% of the rate of administration on tips left by credit or debit cards. In some restaurants, the government has seen evidence that waiters are forced to hand over their own money, if they do not collect enough tips, to cover these fees. The government said it would consider prohibiting employers from charging workers an administrative fee or any other deduction.
The government also said it wanted customers to know that tips are voluntary, asking for the system to become more transparent, with restaurants clearly showing their tip policy.
We asked waiters all over the UK what they think of the tipping process (including how much they take home advice and whether it's fair) and what would be better for them.
1. Rodri, 37, London: ""About 50% of a waiter's income is advice""
Average tips: £60 per eight-hour shift
I think they treat bartenders better in... America. Everything has become fairer since the tip scandal was exposed in the summer of 2015. This is when it was revealed that dozens of restaurants were exposed for skiing staff tips for management fees. However, there are still horror stories of new employees in some chains. I've heard of restaurants that don't pay their chefs a portion of the log (a payment arrangement used to distribute tips). Some restaurants will take 4% of all sales to pay chefs and as a management fee. So, if you sell £1,000 of food, the company will take £40. This is regardless of how much you earn in tips. This means that if a table has a £100 ticket and does not tip, the waiter has to pay £4 of his own money. This leads to a culture that hoards money and, ironically, to bad service. If a table doesn't tip, the waiter feels like they're being robbed by the company and ends up resenting customers.
I can average about £60 in tips per shift but, on a good night, this goes up to over £100 and, on a poor night, it's about £40. About 50% of a bartender's income is advice. All restaurants should have to publicly declare their exact tip procedure. The U.S. has it pretty good – everyone tips.
2. 22-year-old Elle, Edinburgh: 'We never know if it's fair'
Average tips: £20 per eight-hour shift
I think they treat waiters better in France.
I work three jobs, all on zero-hour part-time contracts, catering and hospitality. My main day job is in a cafeteria where the small number of employees work both in front of the house and in the kitchen so that all our tips are put in a pot and shared equally. My main job at night is at a restaurant where we don't receive our advice, but our wages are the minimum wage plus an extra £2.50 per hour (which apparently has been worked to account for average advice when shared with kitchen staff). My third job is catering events and no one tips.
In restaurants, because many customers add tips through card payments, staff never really see how much tips are being given, so we don't know if we're getting our fair share or not. The system seems better in France, where they don't give a lot of tips, but the waiting tables look like a proper job, offering job security and decent income.
3. Ashley, 22 years old, London: 'Tips are heading for customer breakups'
Average tips: £10-15 per eight-hour shift
I think they treat waiters better in Australia.
I work in a pub in southeastern London at night and do day shifts at a local restaurant. In both places, tips are collected and distributed at the end of the night. The money is also taken from the tip jar to cover breaks by staff or customers. If a team member leaves early, they will rarely see their advice because it is shared just before the pub closes.
It is incredibly unfair for our advice to be shared, especially when a team member is not well. Likewise, when a team member does incredibly well, they don't get what they've earned. It's really unfair that advice goes into breakups made by customers. Managers should have ways to pay for broken glasses and plates without docking our tips. I do about 20 pounds a turn, but they'll only give me 10 to 15 pounds of that money. When I'm well tipped, tips impact my finances enormously. Every once in a while, I'll earn more than 50 pounds in one night, which almost doubles my earnings for that day. However, I never receive more than 30 pounds of that money after it has been distributed. I really trust tips because they only pay me £7 an hour.
I would prefer to earn a good basic salary (as in Australia) and therefore did not have to rely on tips to make ends meet.
4. Tom, Manchester: 'A big tip night can help pay the rent'
Average tips: £40 per eight-hour shift
I think they treat waiters better in Italy.
Where he used to work, the floor staff kept 80 per cent of cash tips and 40 per cent of card tips. The other 20% cash went into a pot for the waiters of the commissars and the service bar. Sixty per cent entered a log system, which helped raise kitchen wages. I'm not really sure if this was to help pay the agreed salary or provide bonuses.
It's hard to say how much I won a turn; maybe around £40, £20 of card tips. You can make a massive change in your weekly finances. Sometimes people needed a big night to pay their rent.
They have tips right in Italy, where people don't add a service charge, but usually round their bill so, if they get a meal for €19, they leave a €20 note and don't ask for change. They respect staff and often see people making a career of waiting and experience shows.

"Gas prices in the United States have dropped for four weeks in a row and now average more than 20 cents per gallon cheaper than a year ago, according to a new nationwide survey.
The average cost of a gallon in the continental United States of regular is $3.71, 3 cents less than two weeks earlier, said Trilby Lundberg, editor of the Lundberg survey. Prices have dropped almost 9 cents per gallon in the last four weeks and are 22 cents cheaper than at this point in 2012, Lundberg said.
The lowest Brent crude oil prices of reference in Europe are largely behind the most recent fall. More U.S. refining capacity returning online after seasonal maintenance also contributed, Lundberg said.
From there, in the short term, we can see more price reduction soon, perhaps in the order of this approximate decrease of 3 cents, he said. But the current picture suggests it's not big.
Gas prices broke a three-month upward spiral in early March, which had risen almost 54 cents since the end of December.
The Lundberg survey investigates about 2,500 filling stations in the 48 lower states every two weeks. The most expensive fuel in the last survey, conducted on Friday, was in Chicago, where pump prices averaged $4.10 per gallon; the cheapest could be found in Billings, Montana, at $3.33, Lundberg said.
Average prices per gallon in other cities:
Atlanta: $3.57
Baton Rouge, Louisiana: $3.45
Boston: $3.75
Denver: $3.53
Las Vegas: $3.72
Memphis, Tennessee: $3.43
Miami: $3.74
Philadelphia: $3.64
San Francisco: $4.07
Seattle: $3.81

Dear James,
As you know, we've been working on the new perfume we're releasing in April and we're not sure about some of the packaging details. We've seen some of your creative work in the sales department and we think you have a very good eye for detail.
Do you have any time before closing the business this Friday to sit with us and talk through some of our designs? We would greatly appreciate your advice on this. It shouldn't take more than two hours of your time and we'd be happy to clear it up with Patricia, your head of department, if necessary.
Greetings.

"“I have a Dyson vacuum cleaner, but I don’t even know if I want it. I just picked it up,” said Louise Haggerty, a 56-year-old hairdresser and waitress, from her trip to Black Friday sales at 1 am. “He was crazy in there. It was crazy. It was absolutely disgusting, disgusting.
Haggerty had ventured out to the 24-hour supermarket of Sainsbury in Harringay, north-east London with a friend hoping to pull out a large flat-screen TV. “But so many people pushed in the queue that we didn’t have a chance,” he said. “The poor woman who was second in line was pushed by a crowd of young people. She didn't get anything. People behaved like animals – it was horrible,” he said. I only saw two security guards.
Frustrated for not being able to buy a reduced Blaupunkt 40” TV from £299.99 to £149.99, Haggerty hurried to pick up a Dyson Animal Vac, from £319.99 to £159.99. “I don’t even know how much it costs; I don’t even know if I’m going to buy it. I just wanted something,” he said. There are guys with three, four, five TVs. It’s not fair.”
One of those guys was Andy Blackett, 30, a realtor, who had two carts full of bargains. “I have two coffee machines, two tablets, two TVs and a stereo,” he said. “I couldn’t tell you the prices, but I know they’re bargains,” but his 19-year-old partner Henry Fischer wasn’t as successful. “Someone stole my TV – it’s because I’m the smallest.”
Blackett, Fischer and some companions had driven to Sainsbury’s at 12.45 p.m. after retiring from the “camalam” of the Lea Valley supermarket in Tesco 24 hours, where the sale of the Black Friday began at midnight. “Tesco was scary, so we came here instead,” Blackett said.
More than a dozen police officers attended the Tesco store on Glover Drive, Upper Edmonton, as fighting broke out among anxious and frustrated buyers. Customers were seen tearing down the cardboard deposits put in place to contain the items for sale until midnight. Tesco delayed the sale of his most popular items – TV – for almost an hour until the police put the situation under control. An officer was heard criticizing the manager for not ensuring adequate security and suggested that the sale be suspended altogether. The Tesco store is across the road from an IKEA furniture store that was the scene of riots when it opened with a sale at midnight in 2005.
Police intervened in other stores, including Tesco in Willesden and Surrey Quays, just before the doors opened at midnight. Greater Manchester Police said that at least two people had been arrested at Black Friday sales events already that morning. The force said on their Twitter account: “Stay calm, people!” South Wales police also reported that they received several calls from Tesco store staff after they “concerned the volume of people who had appeared to sell events.”
One of the first buyers of a flat screen television, when sales started just before 1am, was James Alled, 30, a businessman, who bought two and was already negotiating to sell one of them to someone down the line. “I bought them for 250 pounds. I will sell it to you for 350 pounds, 300 pounds in cash,” he said. Back in line, Christine Ball, 62, was not impressed. “I arrived here at 10.15 p.m. and now I am further behind than when I arrived,” he said. “None of those many know what a tail is.”
Ball, who, like most buyers, hadn't heard of U.S.-inspired Black Friday sales so far, said he had come out especially to buy his grandson a TV for Christmas. “Not one of those massive ones; just one normal 100 pounds or so,” he said. In his basket there was a pint of semi-decremated and a loaf of bread. “Tela, milk and bread – the needs,” he said.
Mel Mehmet, 23, had been on Black Friday sales in 2013 and had waited for queues, but said the atmosphere in Tesco scared her this time. “It’s crazy, actually, to have it at midnight – the police must have more important things to do at night than being called to sales. Let’s go to PC World first thing - its sale starts at 8am.”",B1
"After high school, students from the United States go to high school. Going to school is free in the United States, including high schools. Students do not have to pay tuition fees, and even textbooks and lunches are free. Of course, we're talking about public schools. If parents decide to send their children to private schools, they have to pay very expensive classes. High school is the last four years of school than students in the US. are obliged to attend by law.

High school students are divided by grade. It begins in 9th grade and ends with 12th grade. Some secondary schools, including public secondary schools, have entrance examinations or an application process. Public schools admit students depending on where they live. To successfully complete high school, students have to complete a series of basic classes including mathematics, English, science, history, a foreign language, and gymnasium or physical education. Students may usually also choose to take elective courses, or specialized courses in a subject that interests them. Some high schools in the U.S. have exit exams that students must pass in addition to completing their courses to graduate and obtain a high school diploma. A law called No Child Left Behind Act requires high schools to get federal money for students to take a standardized exam each year. A secondary diploma is required for students who wish to continue at university and is considered a minimum requirement for any work.
Secondary school classes are designed to prepare students for college. Some high schools offer specialized skills so that students can find work after graduation without going to college. These schools are called vocational secondary schools. In high school, some students have the opportunity to take Advanced Placement (AP) classes. These are college-level classes. If students pass an exam after taking AP classes, they can get college credit. In high school, students move from class to class throughout the school day.",B1
"After selecting Carl as his partner, Jenny needed to start planning the dance competition at her school. The competition started in two months. Jenny was aware that Carl wasn't a great dancer. He had to spend some time helping him improve his ability. In the early days of preparation, Jenny had planned her dance routine, with the help of her teacher. They were going to dance at Elvis Presley's Jailhouse Rock.

Jenny and Carl spent the first two weeks memorizing their steps and signs for their dance. Carl was pretty clumsy at first. Eventually he held his hand in his hand. They spent the rest of their time perfecting their movements. The day of the competition was almost close. Jenny and Carl were starting to get nervous. They faced nine other pairs from the same school.
The day of the competition came. Carl had not become a great dancer, but he had definitely improved since he began. Since Jenny won last year's competition, she was going to perform with Carl last time. The couples who performed this year were better dancers compared to last year's competition. As each couple took the stage one by one, Jenny became more anxious. Carl noticed this about Jenny and said, ""It's gonna be okay, Jenny. You're great, and I'm sure we'll win."" Jenny felt better after listening to Carl's words. Soon, it was his turn to act. They walked on stage and started dancing as soon as their song started playing.
They had a great start. Jenny's class was there cheering them up. The crowd began to encourage them too. Suddenly, Jenny stumbled and fell. The crowd was shocked. Carl got Jenny back in time for her grand finale. Jenny was upset about her fall. After their performance, the judges counted the scores and were ready to announce the winner. Jenny and Carl won, but it was close. If it wasn't for Jenny's talent and Carl's quick idea of keeping the routine going, they wouldn't have won. Both were awarded a trophy and medals. Jenny and Carl were filled with joy.

"Every time you're online, you're bombarded by photos, articles, links and videos trying to tell your story. Unfortunately, not all these stories are true. Sometimes they want me to click on another story or ad on their own site, other times they want to annoy people for political reasons. Today it is so easy to share information. These stories circulate quickly, and the result is... false news.
There is a series of fake news: from crazy stories that people easily recognize to more subtle types of misinformation. Experts in online media studies and psychology have been examining the phenomenon of fake news. Read these tips, and don't kid yourself!
1. Check the source
Look at the website where the story comes from. Does that sound real to you? Is the text well written? Is there a variety of other stories or is it just a story? Fake news websites often use addresses that sound like real newspapers, but they don't have many real stories about other topics. If you are not sure, click the ""About"" page and look for a clear description of the organization.
2. Watch out for the fake photos.
Many fake news stories use images that are Photoshopped or taken from an unrelated site. Sometimes, if you look closely at an image, you can see if it has been changed. Or use a tool like Google Reverse Image search. It will show you if the same image has been used in other contexts.
3. Check that the story is elsewhere
See if the story you're reading is in other news sites you know and trust. If you find it on many other sites, it is probably not false (although there are some exceptions), as many big news organizations try to review their sources before publishing a story.
4. Find Other Signs
There are other techniques that use fake news. These include the use of ALL CAPS and lots of ads that appear when you click on a link. Also, think about how history makes you feel. If the news pisses you off, it's probably designed to piss you off.
If you know these things about online news, and you can apply them in your everyday life, then you have control over what to read, what to believe, and the most important thing to share. If you find news that you know is false, the most important advice is: don't share it!",B1
"Sony blamed the global economic slowdown, the increase in competition, and a yen that appreciated a 95 percent drop in third quarter profits, while the company announced its results on Thursday.
Customers check Sony's Bravia LCD TVs at an electronics store in Tokyo, Japan.
The profits of the quarter, which ended on December 31, fell from almost 200 billion yen - LRB- 2.2 billion dollars -RRB- in 2007 to about 10 billion yen -LRB- 110 million dollars -RRB- in 2008.
Throughout the company, sales dropped by 25 percent, but electronics and gaming sales were particularly affected.
Game sales, including the company's popular PlayStation series, fell 32 percent during the year. Sales of electronics declined by almost 30 percent.
The appreciation of the yen also reduced profits.
A stronger yen makes Japanese products more expensive or forces companies to reduce their profit margins in order to maintain the same prices.
Last week, Sony warned that it will close the fiscal year, which ends on March 31, with an operational loss of 260 billion yen - LRB- $2.9 billion -RRB-, its first in 14 years. Look what's waiting for Sony.

"Making an appointment to see the dentist is usually one of the smartest decisions a person could make for their health. However, for Marek, booking his appointment with the dentist ended up being one of the worst mistakes of his life. This was due to the fact that the dentist Marek chose to visit his ex-girlfriend with whom he had recently broken up to be with another woman. This foolish mistake resulted in Marek leaving the dentist's office with all 32 missing teeth.

""I had no reason to doubt her,"" Marek says. ""I mean, I thought she was a professional."" On the contrary, her ex-girlfriend decided that this was the perfect opportunity to take revenge for having had a broken heart. She gave him a heavy dose of anesthesia, pulled out all his teeth and ventured all over his face with gauze so he wouldn't notice his work until the bandages were removed. ""The bandages are to protect your gums,"" she told Marek, who later left the office, still heavily numbed by the effects of anesthesia.
As the anesthesia went home, I could say something was terribly wrong because I couldn't feel any teeth. One can only imagine the panic he must have felt after discovering the work of his ex under all the gauze. After reporting the event to the police, her ex is now facing the possibility of three years in prison for a medical negligence suit. On the bright side for her, she could be spending those three years behind bars delighted to know that her shocking acrobatics was very effective in terms of getting even with Marek. After seeing that he no longer had teeth, his new girlfriend broke up with him.",B1
"Maybe there isn't a bigger cartoon character than the world-famous Mickey Mouse. Mickey Mouse is a creation of the late Walt Disney, who pioneered the era of theme parks in American popular culture. Today, Mickey is the official mascot of the Walt Disney Corporation. He is what is called an anthropomorphic character, which is a term used to describe a non-human character that has human characteristics. Mickey can talk, laugh, cry and use his hands as a human. He also walks on two legs instead of four. His red shorts, big yellow shoes, white gloves and large mouse ears make him one of the most recognizable cartoon characters in America and the world.

Mickey was created by Disney in 1928 in the short film Steamboat Willie. That film was the first of 130 films starring the famous mouse. She has also starred in 10 feature films. In the 1930s, Mickey began appearing in comics, and on November 18, 1978, he got his own star on Hollywood Walk of Fame. He became the first cartoon character to win a star on the historic sidewalk. Ten of his films have been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Short Film Animated with Lend a Paw winning the award. Walt Disney received an Honorary Award for creating the character in 1932.
One of the most popular children's shows in U.S. history was the Mickey Mouse Club, which ran from 1955 to 1996. Mickey has a girlfriend named Minnie Mouse, a dog named Pluto, and a number of friends including Donald, and Daisy Duck, who are stars on their own.
Today, Mickey Mouse merchandise can be found all over the world. It appears in all Disney theme parks around the world. In 1988 Mickey made his last feature film when starring Who Framed Roger Rabbit. This was a significant occurrence because it was the first time Disney characters starred alongside Warner Brother's characters. The two corporations had been rivals for a long time.

"The stereotype is that Americans are lazy, but studies show that people in the United States have less vacation time than people in other parts of the world. A typical American worker is given two or three weeks of full-year vacation. Most American workers cannot take those two or three consecutive weeks. They usually have to be extended throughout the year. Even when American workers are on vacation, they are often expected to be in communication with their boss. This means registering by email and mobile phone. Most American companies do not encourage their employees to take every vacation day they are entitled to. In fact, most American companies discourage him.

Other countries, especially countries in Europe, have much longer vacation time. In Germany many people have six weeks of paid vacation. At least three of these weeks can be taken consecutively. Perhaps this is why Europeans and other holiday travelers in exotic faraway places. Most American families tend to stay closer to home, rarely leaving the country.
The difference in the amount of vacation time is legal. Most companies in countries outside the U.S. you have to give your employees paid free time or else pay heavy fines. In the United States, however, there is no federal law requiring employers to give workers paid leave. In fact, the United States is the only developed country that does not guarantee workers annual free time. There have been efforts to pass laws that give American workers a week's vacation paid for by law, but so far those efforts have not been successful.
Even when American workers have free time, many are afraid to take it because they are concerned that they may be seen as unproductive workers and lose their jobs. Other workers worry about going on vacation and having a mountain of work when they return.",B1
"The man suspected of attempting to attack the Dutch royal family by crashing his car near his bus is dead, Dutch police said Friday.
A car is represented after crashing into the crowd waiting for the royal family to visit in Apeldoorn.
The man, whose name was not released, had been seriously injured in Thursday's accident in the city of Apeldoorn, about 45 miles east of Amsterdam, the police said. He died early Friday, the police said.
He had been accused of attempting to attack the royal family, authorities said. Were you there? Send us your video, pictures
The police searched the man's house but found no weapons, explosives or any other leads that could lead to other people's involvement, the police said.
Five people, as well as the driver, were killed and 12 injured in the incident, which occurred during the annual Queen's Day celebration, the police said.
The crowds had lined up the streets to see Queen Beatrice and her family on an open bus during the annual holidays of the Netherlands. See who the Dutch royal family is
As the bus progressed, a black hatchback passed over him. Crowds were behind barriers off the road, but security officials and journalists, including many cameramen, were on the road as the car passed.
The car crashed into the metal railing goes down around a column on the side of the road. The vehicle seemed badly damaged even before the accident, but the reason for that was unclear.
There was no one but the driver in the car at the time, police spokesman Esther Naber said.
Members of the royal family saw the accident and panted, then sat down quickly as the bus continued to drive.
The attack caused outrage in the Netherlands, Friday's newspapers broadly expressing disbelief and suggesting that the monarchy would have to change.
Queens Day will never be the same, said Trouw newspaper. The Netherlands has always been proud of its senseless royal family. With this comes a queen who not only pedals by bicycle, but also mixes with people without obvious safety measures. Is that still possible now that the royal family has been the target of an attack?
Algemeen Dagblad agreed.
What's going to happen on April 30 next year? And will we continue to see the members of the royal family by bicycle through the canals of Amsterdam or in search of bargains at the Bijenkorf in The Hague?
Queen's Day is a national holiday in the Netherlands, the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba. Tradition began in 1885 and celebrates the queen's birthday.
Although Queen Beatriz's birthday is January 31, she officially celebrates her birthday on April 30, according to the Dutch government.
Queen's Day is known for its free market throughout the country, where anyone is allowed to sell things on the streets. Other activities include children's games and musical performances.
The day is marked with orange throughout the country as a reference to the colors of the royal family, which come from the House of Orange-Nassau.

"Andrea's big day was finally here. She had been accepted to her dream medical school in Boston, and was about to fly there to begin her new life. He had received the news of his acceptance two months ago, but he had spent all that time so busy preparing for the move that he had not had time to realize how nervous he really was. It wasn't until the time came to get out of the seat of the plane that he realized his legs were shaking, his heart was racing, and his forehead was sweating.

""Relax!"" She kept repeating herself all the way to her new apartment. She had worked so hard to get here, and she knew she had nothing to fear. Still, as he looked out the window of his new hall, the outside world seemed too frightening to face it. Having grown up on the West Coast all her life, she wasn't ready for what it looked like here. The warm and bright sun that I was so used to seeing at this time of year was nowhere to be seen. Everyone's accents seemed completely unknown, and people seemed even higher than normal.
She decided to stay in the security of her apartment that night and didn't leave until her class time came the next afternoon. While the teacher asked some basic questions to see what level everyone was on, Andrea's mind was completely blank. ""Oh, no!"" She thought for herself. ""I'm not even supposed to be here! Everyone knows a lot more than I do."" Just then, the professor pointed at her and asked her a question about the functions of the spinal cord. As scared as she was, the answer came instinctively out of her mouth. Awesome! Says the professor. ""You'll do great here."" She assured him. As the master walked away, one of the giant ants crawled down Andrea's desk. He quickly pulled him off the edge, and then smiled with confidence.

"All week, Frank and Bob have been waiting for Sunday afternoon. It's when their favorite football team, the Philadelphia Eagles, plays their first game of the season. The Eagles have a new coach, and many new, young and talented players. Football can be a very unpredictable game, over time, injuries, referees, and luck that affect the outcome of the game. In addition, new players and coaches may need some time to learn how to work as a team.

For almost a decade, Frank and Bob have watched Eagles games together. They met through work, but their friendship continues even though Frank left the company a few years ago. Their wives have become close and sometimes even joined them for games. When their children were still young, they used to be just as excited about these Sunday afternoons. Now, in high school, they'd rather hang out with their friends than with their parents. However, Frank and Bob have maintained their friendship and tradition, and could not think of a better way to spend Sunday afternoons.
This week, you'll be watching the game at Bob's house, which is eager to show off the new sound system he installed in his basement. While Frank walks through the entrance, carrying a package of his favorite beer, Bob goes out to meet him, already dressed in Eagle's uniform. After some playful punches, they come together for a quick hug. Once inside, they are greeted by the familiar sounds of the pre-game show. It's gonna be a great season!",B1

"Angela Erdmann never met her grandfather. She died in 1946, six years before she was born. But, on Tuesday, April 8, 2014, he described the extraordinary moment when he received a message in a bottle, 101 years after he had pressed him into the Baltic Sea. Considered the oldest message in the world in a bottle, it was presented to Erdmann by the museum that now exhibits it in Germany.
“It was very surprising,” said Erdmann, 62, remembering how he found out about the bottle. “A man stood at my door and told me that he had a position of my grandfather. Then he told me that a message had been found in a bottle and that the name on the card was that of my grandfather.” His visitor was a genealogical researcher who had managed to locate her in Berlin after the letter was delivered to the International Maritime Museum in the northern port city of Hamburg.
The bottle of brown beer, which had been in the water for 101 years, was found in the capture of Konrad Fischer, a fisherman, who had been in the Baltic Sea opposite the northern city of Kiel. Holger von Neuhoff, curator for the ocean and science at the museum, said this bottled message was the oldest he had ever found. “There are documents that have been found without the bottle that are older and are in the museum,” he said. “But, with the bottle and the document, this is undoubtedly the oldest at the moment. He's in very good condition.
Researchers believe that Erdmann's grandfather, Richard Platz, threw the bottle into the sea as he walked with a group of appreciation of nature in 1913. I was 20 at the time.
Much of the postcard was indecipherable, although the address in Berlin at the front of the card was legible, as was the author's kind request that the search engine send the note to his home.
“It also included two stamps from that time that were also in the bottle, so the search engine would not incur a cost,” Erdmann said. “But he didn’t think it would take 101 years.”
She said she was moved by the arrival of the message, although she had not met her grandfather because he died, at the age of 54, six years before she was born.
“I knew very little about my grandfather, but I discovered that he was a writer who was very open-minded, believed in freedom and that everyone should respect each other,” he said. “He did a lot for the young people and later traveled with his wife and two daughters. It was wonderful because I could see where my roots came from.
Like his grandfather, Erdmann said, he also liked culture and traveled the world. She also described herself as open-minded. “What he taught his two daughters, my mother taught me and then I gave it to my sons,” she said. Despite his joy at receiving the bottled message, he said he hoped others would not repeat what his grandfather had done and throw bottles of messages into the sea. “Today, the sea is so full of bottles and garbage that it shouldn’t be thrown there anymore,” he said.
The message and bottle will be displayed at the Hamburg Maritime Museum until early May 2014, after which experts will try to decipher the rest of the text. It is unclear what will happen to the bottle, but Erdmann expects it to stay in the museum.
“We want to make some photos available to put with the bottle and give it a face, so visitors can see the young man who threw the bottle in the water,” he said.

"Karla had just moved to the city and enrolled her eight-year-old son Gavin in a new school. Karla used to be a very active participant in the school community. She always volunteered in the classroom, went to meetings of the Association of Parents and Teachers, and was a companion on class trips. Karla wanted to do the same at the new school her son was attending. She felt that it was a good example for Gavin, and helped her to be more in tune with what was happening at school.

The new school, however, had different rules. Karla couldn't show up in the classroom and offer help. He couldn't even offer himself as an escort on class trips. District regulations forced her to take fingerprints. The school district would then do a background check on Karla based on fingerprints. The school district had very strict rules on allowing persons with criminal convictions to volunteer at school.
Although Karla didn't have any trouble getting fingerprints, the fingerprint office had very limited hours. Nor could she enter when it was convenient for her. I had to make an appointment. The fingerprint office was also a long way from where Karla lived. I'd have to take two buses to get there.
Karla also had to be tested for tuberculosis. The TB test was easy. It was just a small puncture to the lower arm, but this required another separate appointment in a separate place. The test didn't cost Karla anything, but again, the office I had to go to was far away.
Karla understood that the school district wants children to be safe and healthy, but she also felt that they were making it difficult for parents.",B1

"Probably the best baseball player in the Major League of all time is George Herman Ruth. The baby, as he was known, is largely responsible for building the game as it exists today. The stadium where he played in New York is commonly called ""The House Ruth Built"". Ruth played baseball for 22 years for the Boston Red Sox, and the New York Yankees, where she rewrote the record books. Almost without help he invented home run, which is the most appreciated feat of baseball. Before Ruth, home run was a novelty. It was a strategy game, but the Babe changed all that.

Ruth was born in a rough section of Baltimore, Maryland in 1895. Much of his childhood has been lost in history. He spent several years in the reform school of Santa Maria after being labeled ""incorrigible"". His behavior was thought to go beyond rehab. When he exactly started baseball, it's also a mystery. Some accounts offer that he was placed on the Santa Maria baseball team by the coach of the time. A popular story has sent Ruth to school because of her natural ability to hit a baseball. The story is that Ruth broke many windows while playing baseball on the streets, and that's why she was sent to school in the first place.
Before the 1920s, baseball was a slow game that included advancing players around the bases strategically hitting the ball inside the park. Ruth entered and was soon hitting balls outside the stadium to the delight of the fans who were present. The home run became an integral part of the game. Ruth won several nicknames because of her power, including the ""Bambino"", and the ""Sultan of Swat"".
When Ruth was traded by the Red Sox to the Yankees in a very unpopular movement, the Yankees won seven World Series championships in their 12 years. Ruth also made headlines for her clowning after hours in New York City. Your drink and your feminization are well documented. However, Ruth was a spiritual man who lived his years as a devout Catholic.",B1

"One of the best Hollywood directors in the history of the film industry is Steven Allan Spielberg. Spielberg has directed some of the most significant and popular films in Hollywood's recent history. His list of films is read as a who is who in the film industry. He has directed such blockbusters as E.T. The Extraterrestrial, Jurassic Park, Third-Type Close Encounters, Schindler's List, and Saving Private Ryan.

Born in a Jewish family on December 18, 1946 in Cincinnati, Ohio, young Spielberg showed interest in cinema during his teenage years. When he was 12, Spielberg created a nine-minute film to win his photographic badge at the Boy Scouts. This was the first movie he ever made. Her parents divorced when she was 13, and Spielberg moved with her family to California. After graduating from high school, he went to the University of Southern California (USC) to learn film, but did not graduate. Instead he attended Long Beach State, where he earned his degree in Cinematographic Production and Electronic Arts, 35 years after attending university for the first time.
His first work was as a television writer, having written scripts for popular shows such as Night Gallery, Marcus Welby, M.D., and Columbo in the 1970s. His great movie in Hollywood was that of 1975, which is one of the most popular, most taquileras in the history of the silver screen. He followed Jaws' success with several films that have earned him a place in the Hollywood tradition. His films have become family names.
Spielberg shows no signs of deceleration. He is involved in several film projects as director and producer. Spielberg has been married twice, and he has six children. He was elected the most influential Celebrity magazine of Forbes in America in 2014. Their personal wealth is estimated at over $3 billion.

"President Barack Obama's re-election campaign released his fundraiser number on Monday, reporting that he raised $71 million to Republican opponent Mitt Romney from approximately $100 million. The campaign responded thanks to the more than 706,000 donors who reached that point, but also asked for more money.
They still beat us... and not for a bit, said Ann Marie Habershaw, director of Obama's operations for the United States, in the email. If we lose this election, it's because we don't close the gap enough when we had the chance.
To be sure, neither campaign is raking in dumb change. As we did with Romney's contributions, this is what the president could get for his $71 million.
2,071 students could attend Sidwell Friends School for a year. Daughters Sasha and Malia attend exclusive private school in Northwest D.C. -LRB- which could also afford hot lunches -RRB-. At $34,268 per year, school enrolment is higher than the average private university enrolment in the United States and more than double what it costs to go to a public university.
32.272 Portuguese water dogs. At about $2,200 per pet, Bo, the first dog, could take 32,272 purebred, hypoallergenic friends.
479.729 J. Crew Pembridge Dot Pencil Skirts. First Lady Michelle Obama wore one on 10 Downing Street to meet British Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha, and on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. The double-use mint green skirt has $148 in the American clothing chain.
8 million pounds of sugar. While in Iowa in 2008, Obama was criticized for being out of touch after he asked a group of farmers if they had checked the price of the run at Whole Foods. The boutique supermarket did not open its first store in Iowa until spring of this year, and several people present in its speech admitted they did not know what the run was. The current price is about $9 per pound.
3 properties of Martha's Vineyard. The Obamas will not go on vacation to Blue Heron Farm, also known as the White House in front of Cabo Bacalao, and not just for the demanding campaign schedule. The complex, which includes two full-size houses, a par-3 golf hole and equestrian facilities, was included in August for $23.7 million.
18.525 orders from Chili Bowl de Ben half smoked and French fries with cheese for next year. At $10.50 per order, Obama's favorite could be a feast for many of your closest friends over the next 365 days.
65.558.632 Yuengling Lagers. At $6.49 per package of six, the cost of one of Obama's favorite beers is approximately $1.08. Triple the cost in a bar, and you could still enjoy the company of 22 million people -- 7% of the U.S. population. -- slurping in the best brewery in Pennsylvania
417,671 Official Balls of Spalding NBA game. $71 million buys almost half a million of the $169.99. That means that with 10 people in one court at a time, more than 4 million people could play one of Obama's favorite sports and Americans simultaneously.

"Rockefeller Center is a complex of 19 buildings. It is named after a famous New York City business tycoon, John D. Rockefeller, who built the 1930-1939 building group. The most famous building in the complex is the General Electric building where NBC television studios are located. It is located in the middle of Manhattan, New York, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues and between 48th and 51st Streets. The address of the GE building is 30 Rockefeller Plaza. That's how the show ""30 Rock"" got its name. The show was filmed there. Saturday Night Live, a popular American night show, is also filmed there. Visitors can get tickets to watch a recorded show and they can also visit the studios.

Visitors to the Rockefeller Center can visit the square, which becomes an ice skating rink in winter. Every year a huge Christmas tree is placed there and thousands of people attend the tree lighting ceremony, which always features famous singers. In spring, summer and autumn, the square becomes a coffee. In the middle of the square is a statue of the Greek god Prometheus. His myth says he brought fire into the world. 200 flags from all United Nations countries surround the square.
Radio City Music Hall is another famous building at the Rockefeller Center. Many musicians give concerts here, but it is better known as the home of the Rockettes, a dance company called by the Rockefeller Center. They are famous for their kick lines and are best known for performing at Radio City Christmas Spectacular, an annual musical party show.",B1
"If you want to rent an apartment, you have to sign a lease, which is a legally binding contract between you and the owner, the person who owns the property. A lease is usually good for a certain time. Some leases are monthly, but most are for a period of one or two years.

The lease or rental agreement lists your responsibilities as a tenant and the responsibilities of the owner. The rent will tell you how much the monthly rent is, when it is due, and how you can pay it. Some owners will only accept a certified check or money order, and others will accept a personal or cash check. If you pay your rent late, there is usually a late fee. The late rate amount is also generally in the lease. The lease will also tell you how much the security deposit is. It is usually the amount of a month's rent. The lease will tell you if you can have pets or not. Many places do not allow pets. If you bring one anyway, you can get fined or thrown out. If your apartment allows pets, you will most likely have to pay an extra amount of money, called a pet deposit, to cover any damage caused by the animal. Other rules that can be included in a lease include whether you are allowed to smoke inside the property and if you are allowed to make any changes as paint. Many owners do not allow you to paint or even make holes in the wall to hang images.
A lease is proof that you live legally somewhere. Sometimes you need a lease to show a school that you live within a given area. Be sure to get a copy of the signed lease from your landlord.",B1
"Most children in the United States start school at the age of 5, when they go to kindergarten. This is the beginning of primary or primary school. Most children remain in primary schools until they are about 11 years old. Primary schools are divided by grade. Younger children start in kindergarten at age 5 and then go to first grade, second grade and so on. Most primary schools go up to the fifth or sixth grade.

The focus of a primary school is on basic academic and socialization skills. Most children learn to read, write, count, add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Students also learn the rules of grammar, spelling and vocabulary in English. Children also learn basic social studies or history, science, art and musical skills, and participate in gymnasium or physical education. In primary schools, children also learn to follow instructions, share and work in groups. Students usually stay in a classroom all day with a teacher who stays with them throughout the year. Students can leave the classroom to visit the school library, the school gymnasium and attend special science, art and music classes. Students also usually leave the classroom for lunch and recreation. For lunch the students sit at the tables, separated by grade, in a large cafeteria. Recreation usually lasts half an hour when children go out to play in a courtyard. The typical school day starts around 8:00 a.m. and ends around 3:00 p.m. Students go to school Monday through Friday and have the weekends off.
Primary school teachers are authorized by the state where they work. They have to graduate from college, or even graduate school by taking special classes in early childhood and primary education. Before teachers can be in a classroom with students, they have to pass a background check and take an exam.",B1
"The baseball game in the United States is the oldest major league sport in the country. Major Baseball Leagues trace their roots back to the 1880s, but the game had been enjoyed by Americans for decades before then. The origins of the game are in question. For many years a 19th-century American named Abner Doubleday was credited with creating the game, but this has been proved inaccurate today.

One theory is that the game was carried across the Atlantic Ocean during the great European migration of the eighteenth century, and that it is based on the British cricket game. Cricket is a very popular sport in England, but it is played mainly by the upper class members of that society, and it is unlikely that poor immigrants from England would play the game a lot. However, it looks more like the game of the rounders, which is another English sport that shares many common features such as the American baseball game.
In any case, the game became very popular in the United States. By the 20th century, the American League and the National League were taking the country for assault. The best team in the history of both leagues are the New York Yankees. The Yankees have won more World Series titles than any other team in history.
The World Series is a seven-game competition with the top two teams in any league. The first team to win four games is declared World Series Champion. In 1903, the Boston Americans won the first World Series defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates. This was the start of an annual series match between the two leagues. To date, the Yankees have won 27 championships in 40 appearances, with the team's most recent title in 2009. The Cardinals of San Luis lead the National League with 11 titles in 19 appearances, with their last title in 2011.",B1

"The Los Angeles Kings hockey team won the 2014 Stanley Cup and held a parade last Monday in Los Angeles to celebrate the victory. During the parade, fans from all over California went out to support and celebrate with their favorite hockey team. According to the L.A.P.D., more than 200 uniformed officers were sent to the parade to make sure everything went well. Although the parade went smoothly, the LAPD Public Information Officer said there was an increase in alcohol-related arrests that when the Kings won the Stanley Cup in 2012.

According to Christopher Harris, who attended the parade with his family, many people who attended the parade had gone to the bars surrounding the Staples Center, and had gotten drunk before attending the parade. ""I saw a person throw up in the street in front of a cop. They put it in the back of the police car,"" Harris said. The applause of the crowd began to grow stronger as the players of the Kings began to pass.
Robert Lopez, who attended the parade despite supporting the New York Rangers, said that Kings fans began to get very upset. I was pretty sure it was about alcohol; they all seemed pretty drunk. Lopez said he was glad he didn't bring his New York Rangers shirt, as he originally planned, because he said people would definitely have thrown things at him.
A public relations worker from Los Angeles Kings issued a statement to the hockey organization saying they don't tolerate people drinking before they go to the parade. He went on to say that they took the precaution that the parade would begin before 2012 so that people would not have the opportunity to go for a drink. Looks like he's still failing.",B1
"In the United States someone legally becomes an adult when he turns 18. At the age of 18, U.S. citizens can vote. They can also serve in the army and go to fight in wars for the country. An 18-year-old can also buy cigarettes and other tobacco products, but 18-year-olds cannot buy alcoholic beverages. People in America have to wait until they're 21 to be able to do that.

At the age of 18, people can live legally on their own, work and marry. However, turning 18 does not mean that everyone is ready to take on adult responsibilities. At the age of 18, most people have just graduated from high school. A lot of people are going to college. Some young people choose to go to college away from their homes and live in dormitories. Others choose a university near home and stay with their parents to save money. However, others will choose to live on their own. Legally, a father doesn't have to support his son when he turns 18.
Some parents in the United States take this very seriously and expect their children to move as soon as they turn 18. Some parents will even force their children out when they turn 18. There tends to be some difference about this depending on whether the child is female or male. It is considered more acceptable for a woman to continue living with her parents after she turns 18. Many women are not expected to leave their parents' house until they are married. However, there is still an expectation that young people will come out and live independent lives as soon as they can. With the U.S. economy struggling, some adult children are returning to their parents' home in their 20s and 30s. These are called boomerang children, since like a boomerang, they come back from where they came from.",B1
"The U.S. community college system is a place for second chances. Community colleges are two-year schools that flourished in California after the end of World War II. Many American soldiers were returning to civilian life after their service in the country. Some of these young people decided not to go to college after high school so that they could serve their country during that time of need. When they returned, many of them went to the community college system in California to continue their education.

The U.S. government introduced the G.I. At that time, Bill gave soldiers and women returning educational benefits to help them get back to school. Community colleges and new school districts soon began to appear throughout the country. Community universities helped facilitate the return of military personnel to university life. It was a low-cost alternative, less stressful to go back to a four-year college.
Today, community schools attract students from all over the world. In California, a large student population comes from Asia and Latin America. These schools offer a second opportunity to international students who may have had difficulty attending university in their home countries. American students who may not have done well academically in high school, and did not enter a university, may also turn to community college for a second chance.
Community schools provide a much needed resource for all these students. Former military, international students and high school students alike are welcome. One of the best things about community colleges is that they accept anyone at any time. This means that people who haven't found what they want to do in life can try more than one area of study. If you don't like a study course, you can always try something else. That's the beauty of community schools.",B1

"William Moore didn't trust the idea of marriage. It came from a broken family. His mother and father divorced when he was only 10. His two brothers had married twice; each marriage ended in divorce. ""Marriage is the end,"" William always said. His view of marriage always stood in the way of his relationships. I was dating women who were always looking for something serious. William wasn't looking for that. I wanted someone to have fun and that was it.

William hadn't found someone he felt strongly for in a long time. The last time she felt anything for a girl was during her senior year of college. Her name was Linda. Linda was in William's math class, and she always helped William with his homework. They started dating after school, and dating every week. When William told Linda his views on marriage, she didn't get scared. Actually, he liked the idea. ""It's a lot of pressure. A lot of men think that women just want to get married, you know, I don't. At least not right now,"" Linda said.
William decided to give Linda a chance. He liked it. They had the same point of view about marriage. However, during the last month of school, Linda received an email that changed her life. He had the opportunity to study in Europe. William didn't want Linda to leave. Linda said it was a unique opportunity in life. William even thought of asking Linda to marry him to see if she would stay, but he knew she wouldn't change her mind. He let her go. That saddened William. I didn't know if he wanted to get married, but I really wanted to have someone there for him.",A1

"Plato's Republic focuses on a simple question: is it always better to be just than unjust? The puzzles in Book One prepare for this question, and Glaucon and Adeimanto make it explicit at the beginning of Book Two. To answer the question, Socrates takes a long way, outlining an account of a good city on the basis that a good city would be just and that defining justice as a virtue of a city would help define justice as a virtue of a human being. Socrates is finally close to answering the question after he characterizes justice as a personal virtue at the end of Book Four, but is interrupted and challenged to defend some of the most controversial features of the good city he has outlined. In Books Five to Seven, he addresses this challenge, arguing (in effect) that the righteous city and human being just as he has outlined them are indeed good and are in principle possible. After this long digression, Socrates in Books Eight and Nine finally delivers three “proofs” that it is always better to be just than unjust. So, because Socrates not only wants to prove that it is always better to be just, but also to convince Glaucón and Adeimanto of this point, and because the evidence of Socrates opposes the teachings of the poets, he reinforces his case in Book Ten by accusing poets of representing the truth and by offering a new myth that is consonant with their proofs.
As this general view makes clear, the center of Plato's Republic is a contribution to ethics: a discussion of what is the justice of virtues and why a person should be just. However, because Socrates links his discussion of personal justice with an account of justice in the city and makes statements about how good and bad cities are arranged, the Republic also holds reflections on political issues. It is not that ethics and politics exhaust the concerns of the Republic. The account in Books Five to Seven of how a righteous city and a righteous person are in principle possible is an account of how knowledge can govern, including the discussion of what knowledge and its objects are. In addition, the accusation of poets implies a wide discussion of art. However, this article focuses on the ethics and politics of the Republic of Plato. For more information on what the Republic says about knowledge and its objects, see Plato: mid-term metaphysics and epistemology, and for more information on the discussion of poets, see Plato: rhetoric and poetry.
This article seeks to provide a constructive guide on the main ethical and political issues in the Republic. Two assumptions shape your organization. Firstly, it assumes that a relationship of ethics and politics in the Republic requires a preliminary understanding of the question that Socrates is facing and the strategy that Socrates uses to answer the question. Secondly, it assumes that politics in the Republic is based on moral psychology in the Republic, and therefore the former is discussed more usefully after the latter.",C2
"Taliban militants, who applied Islamic law in the violent Swat Valley in Pakistan last week, have now taken control of a neighbouring district.
Protests in Karachi against the creation of sharia courts in the Swat Valley.
Here are some answers about the Swat Valley, its history and what is happening there.
What is Swat Valley? Swat Valley is located in the province of Pakistan's northwest border, near the border with Afghanistan and about 185 miles - LRB- 300 kilometers -RRB - from the Pakistani capital of Islamabad.
The Alpine region was once one of Pakistan's main tourist destinations, with the nation's only ski resort until it was closed after Taliban militants invaded the area. It was also a draw for trout fishing lovers and those who wanted to visit the ancient Buddhist ruins in the area.
What's going on in Swat Valley? In recent years, Taliban militants unleashed a wave of violence that claimed hundreds of lives in the province. The militants wanted Sharia or Islamic law to be imposed in the region. They took over the valley in 2008.
The central government of Pakistan, which for a long time exercised little control in the area, launched an intense military offensive at the end of July to drive out militants. In retaliation, the Taliban carried out a series of deadly attacks and began to gain ground by establishing checkpoints in the area.
Has the government intervened? The militants and the Pakistani government reached a peace agreement earlier this year, which was recently signed by Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari.
Under the agreement, sharia law was enforced in the region. While the peace agreement was criticized by the Pakistani government, some analysts and political observers say that the government had no choice but to capitulate, as militants have terrorized the region with beheadings, kidnappings and the destruction of schools.
What's going on now? This week, the Taliban took control of Buner's neighboring district, bringing it closer to Islamabad since the beginning of the Taliban insurgency.
What is sharia? Sharia is Islamic law. Although there are different interpretations, the strict interpretation of the Taliban prohibits women from being seen in public without their husbands and parents, requires veils for women and beards for men, and prohibits music and television.
The consequences are severe; during the Taliban's struggle to impose the sharia, anyone who was disobeying was caught on the ground and beaten. Others were beheaded and hung on posts, with warnings attached to their bodies that anyone who dared to remove the body before 48 hours passed would also be beheaded and hanged.

"They may not know who Steve Jobs was or even how to tie their own laces, but the average six-year-old understands more about digital technology than a 45-year-old, according to a new authorized report.
The advent of broadband in 2000 has created a generation of digital natives, says Ofcom (which verifies standards in the UK communications industries) in its annual study on British consumers. Born in the new millennium, these children have never known the dark ages of Internet dialing and the younger ones are learning to operate smartphones or tablets before they can speak.
“These young people are shaping communications,” said Jane Rumble, Media Research Director at Ofcom. “As a result of growing in the digital age, they are developing communication habits fundamentally different from older generations, even compared to what we call the first adopters, the 16-24 age group.”
Ofcom devised a ""digital quotient"", or DQ, test to put 800 children and 2,000 adults through their steps, which, instead of measuring intelligence, as an IQ test, would attempt to measure awareness and self-confidence around smartwatch tablets devices, super-fast Internet knowledge, 4G mobile phone networks and mobile applications.
Among children aged 6 to 7, who have grown up with YouTube, streaming Spotify music and online television, the average DQ score was 98, higher than for those aged 45 to 49, who scored an average of 96. Digital comprehension reaches its peak between 14 and 15 years of age, when the average is 113 DQ, and then gradually decreases throughout adulthood, before falling rapidly into old age.
People are now invited to test their digital knowledge with an abbreviated version of the questionnaire that will give any member of the public a DQ score, along with tips on how to improve their understanding and protect themselves and their families online.
The ways in which millennial children come into contact with each other and consume entertainment are so different from previous generations that predictors now consider their preferences a better indication of the future than those of young adults who set trends.
The most notable change is in the time spent talking on the phone. Two decades ago, teenagers devoted their nights to monopolizing the home phone line, dissecting loving affairs and friendships in conversations that lasted hours.
For people aged 12 to 15, phone calls represent only 3% of the time spent communicating through any device. For all adults, this figure is 20% and, for young adults, it remains three times higher, at 9%. Today's children do most of their remote socialization by sending written messages or through photographs and shared videos. “The millennium generation is losing its voice,” says Ofcom.
More than 90% of your device's time is based on messages, chatting on social networks like Facebook, sending instant messages through services like WhatsApp or even shooting traditional text messages from mobile phones. Only 2 per cent of children ' s time is passed by e-mail, compared to 33 per cent for adults.
Far from their phones, children aged 12 to 15 also have a very different relationship with other media. A seven-day digital diary shows that live television accounts for only half of the audience for this age group, compared to almost 70% for all adults. They spend 20% of their time watching short video clips, for example on YouTube, or news clips distributed through Facebook and other social sites. The rest of its display is shared among DVDs, content transmitted via Netflix or iTunes and TV shows recorded.
Young people between the ages of 16 and 24 are voracious consumers of almost all media. However, live radio and print media have virtually disappeared from their daily diet.
Young people are moving away from live television and into broadcast and catch-up services. Even among adults, television is becoming less important. Television among 16 to 24 year olds has been submerging every year since 2010, but 2013 was the first year in which researchers found that vision fell in all age groups. The theory is that tablets – one of the most popular Christmas gifts in 2012 and 2013 – have brought many older people online for longer. With large screens and simple touch-based interfaces, tablets are being credited with a leap in Internet access among those over 65.
“For years, those over 65 have had a very stubborn resistance to accessing the Internet,” said James Thickett, Director of Research at Ofcom. “In the last three years, we’ve seen that change and we think it’s reduced to tablets.”
Britain is adopting Internet-enabled devices across generations, as the balance between sleep and screen-based activities has now tilted. The typical adult spends eight hours and 41 minutes a day communicating or consuming media, including old-fashioned books and newspapers, and only eight hours and 21 minutes asleep.

"China's top foreign policy official met North Korean leader Kim Jong Il on Thursday and the two sides reached consensus on reducing tensions on the Korean peninsula, officials said.
The meeting marks the first between Kim and a senior official from China since the outbreak between the two Koreas.
The two sides reached consensus on bilateral relations and the situation on the Korean peninsula following frank and in-depth talks, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Jiang Yu.
She did not explain in detail what Kim discussed with Officer Dai Bingguo during his visit to Pyongyang.
Tensions on the Korean peninsula intensified following North Korea ' s bombing of South Korea ' s Yeonpyeong Island last month, as well as the sinking in March of a South Korean warship -- supposedly by a North Korean torpedo -- and recent revelations that it is enriching uranium for nuclear weapons.
North Korean officials have been pushing for the resumption of talks between the six parties, including China and Russia.
China has also called for emergency talks between the six countries -- North Korea, South Korea, China, the United States, Japan and Russia -- to address tensions on the Korean peninsula.
But the United States has refused so far, seeking first of all evidence that North Korea is serious about not fuelling military tensions and serious about stifling the development of its nuclear program.
For the second day in a row, the head of the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff called on China to use its influence to control North Korea to avert a total crisis. China is North Korea's strongest ally and the largest trading partner.
In fact, I believe that, because these provocations continue and apparently in a frequent interval, the danger is increasing and that measures must be taken to ensure that they stop, he said at a press conference in Tokyo.
Much of this volatility is due to the unwise behavior of the North Korean regime, allowed by its friends in China.

"After receiving nearly 100 reports of gas pedals stuck in Ford and Mazda vehicles, federal regulators said Tuesday that they have initiated an investigation into the problem, which is an alleged cause of death and nine injuries.
Stuck accelerators are being investigated for their potential role in a fatal accident, 13 non-fatal accidents or fires, and eight injury accidents, according to the National Road Safety Administration.
Ford and Mazda said 591,245 vehicles were potentially affected, according to car manufacturers' reports to NHTSA in 2004. More than half of the vehicles were 2001-2004 Ford Escapes model year. The remaining vehicles were the Mazda Homenajes 2001-2004.
NHTSA has identified 730,000 potentially affected vehicles, extending the scope of the vehicles concerned. All 730,000 are 2001-2004 Ford Escape and Mazda Tribute SUVs with V6 engines, according to NHTSA.
Mazda and Ford issued souvenirs in 2004 on models of sports utility vehicles that had 3.0-liter six-cylinder engines. Several of the NHTSA reports involve vehicles not covered by previous reminders, the agency said in a letter to Ford's Global Director of Environmental Compliance and Safety on Thursday.
One complaint is based on a fatal accident in January 2012, said NHTSA. Some of the allegations claim that the judgements may have been related to reparations made in response to the security reminders initiated in 2004, according to the summary of the investigation.
The 2004 Ford and Mazda remembers were for vehicle speed control cables in their affected vehicles. Letters were also sent to distributors and customers, according to presentations on the NHTSA website.
In your vehicle, the accelerator cable may prevent the accelerator from returning to the idle position, which can result in high engine speeds while driving, Ford's letter to customers reads. An unexpected increase in engine idle speed can increase the stopping distance and cause a vehicle crash without notice.
The Center for Automatic Security requested NHTSA to open a similar investigation on 8 July. The petition was denied on Thursday because part of the application is being covered by the agency's newly opened investigation.
NHTSA has opened the investigation to assess the scope, frequency and consequences related to the safety of the alleged defect, the agency said.
Neither Ford nor Mazda responded to CNN's requests for comment.

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge won the first round in their battle for privacy on Tuesday, when a French magazine was banned from selling or reusing images taken from the couple in a private castle in Provence.
But the war is far from over, as French prosecutors must now decide whether criminal proceedings will be initiated against the magazine's editor and the photographer or photographers responsible for taking photos of the Duchess sunbathing in topless while on vacation in southern France.
The Tribunal de Grande Instance in Nanterre, Paris, issued a court order ordering the gossip magazine Closer to deliver the digital archives of the images within 24 hours and to prevent their further dissemination, including on its website and tablet application.
The four-page ruling, which only concerns Mondadori Magazines France, publisher of Closer, also ordered him to pay 2,000 euros in legal costs. The magazine faces a fine of €10,000 for each day that does not comply with the order. The couple did not seek compensation.
“These snapshots, showing the intimacy of a couple, partially naked on the terrace of a private house, surrounded by a park several hundred meters from a public road, and being able to legitimately assume that they are protected from passersby, are by nature particularly intrusive,” he said.
The judges ruled that every photograph published in France by Mondadori, the publisher owned by former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, would in future carry a fine, also of 10,000 euros for non-compliance.
But the failure refers only to the 14 images that have already been published. Closer's editor has hinted that he has other more intimate images.
The Palacio de Santiago said the couple “welcome the judge’s ruling.” One source said, “They always believed that the law was broken and that they had a right to their privacy.” Maud Sobel, a lawyer for the royal couple in Paris, described it as “a wonderful decision,” adding: “We have been vindicated.”
Although his civil action has been successful, the couple has taken the rare step of seeking a much more public criminal trial for violation of privacy against the magazine and photographer or photographers responsible.
The prosecutor will have to decide the objectives of any criminal procedure and the complaint cites ""unknown persons"". But it is understood that the couple want a trial against the publisher of Closer, who published the photos on Friday, and who took the images of the couple sunbathing in the castle, which belongs to Lord Linley, son of late Princess Margaret.
The Paris police opened a preliminary investigation on Tuesday. Under French law, violation of privacy carries a maximum penalty of one year ' s imprisonment and a fine of 45,000 euros.
This is the legal action that will really put a marker, and in pursuing it the couple indicates a determination to convey a broader message to the world and, they hope, deter the paparazzi in the future.
His lawyers had not requested that copies of Closer magazine be removed from the shelves.
On Saturday the Irish Daily Star published the photos, which led the editor to be suspended on Monday night pending the outcome of an internal investigation. Also on Monday, the famous Italian magazine Mondadori Chi launched a special edition with 26 pages dedicated to the frank photos of the future queen.
The couple’s lawyer, Aurélien Hamelle, had told the Paris court that it was necessary to block the “highly intimate” images of the Duchess without her bikini, as she was a “young woman, not an object”.
But Delphine Pando, defending Closer, said the action was a “disproportionate response” to the publication of the photographs. He added that the magazine could not control its resale, as it did not possess the original images.
Copies of Closer magazine were doing fast business on the eBay online auction site, with a sale of £31.01, until the site removed all listings after “strong feedback” from their community.

"The New York City Board of Health voted Thursday to ban the sale of sugary drinks in containers of more than 16 ounces in restaurants and elsewhere, in a movement aimed at combating obesity and encouraging residents to live healthier lifestyles.
The council voted eight in favour, with one abstention.
It's time to face the facts: obesity is one of America's most deadly problems, and sugary drinks are one of the main causes of it, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a statement earlier this month. As sugary drinks have grown in size, so have our waists -- and also diabetes and heart disease.
Bloomberg Visionary Movement Against Obesity
But the bill is expected to generate more protests from the soft drinks industry and those concerned about government participation in their personal choices.
What we need in New York are sensible solutions to the obesity problem that focus on a holistic approach to addressing an extremely complex problem, said Eliot Hoff, spokesperson for a group sponsored by the beverage industry called New Yorkers for Beverage Choices. New Yorkers are smart enough to decide for themselves what to eat and drink.
Critics, including McDonald's and Coca-Cola, have attacked the ban as wrong and arbitrary, although Bloomberg has billed it as both a health and fiscal initiative.
New York City spends approximately $4 billion each year on medical care for overweight people, the mayor said in an earlier statement.
Big Gulp? Meet your older brother.
One in eight New Yorkers also suffers from diabetes, a disease often related to obesity, his office said, calling sugary drinks the biggest driver of these alarming increases in obesity.
About 58% of adults in New York City are considered obese or overweight, the mayor added.
In 2007, the health board appointed by Bloomberg adopted a regulation that forced restaurants to eliminate the use of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils and spread, the main sources of trans fats in the American diet.
Thursday's decision is expected to come into effect in six months and be implemented by the city's regular restaurant inspection team, allowing restaurant owners to adjust to changes before facing fines.
Six months from today, our city will be an even healthier place, tweeted Bloomberg on Thursday.
The ban would not apply to grocery stores.
Forget about the big sodas, how about banning the fries?

"The current feminist political philosophy is indebted to the work of previous generations of feminist scholarship and activism, including the first wave of feminism in the English-speaking world, which took place from the 1840s to the 1920s and focused on improving the political, educational and economic system mainly for middle-class women. Its greatest achievements are the development of a language of equal rights for women and the acquisition of women ' s voting rights. It is also indebted to the second wave of feminism, which, beginning in the 1960s, was based on the language of civil rights movements (for example, liberation language) and a new feminist consciousness that emerged through women's solidarity movements and new forms of reflection that discovered sexist attitudes and impediments throughout society. In 1970, feminism had moved from activism to scholarship with the publication of The Sexual Dialectics of Shulamith Firestone (Firestone 1971); Kate Millett's Sexual Policy (Millett 1970); and Robin Morgan's Brotherhood is Powerful (Morgan 1970).
One of the first theoretical advances of second wave feminism was to separate the biological conceptions of the identity of women from those socially constructed to refute the notion that biology was destiny and, therefore, the main role of women was as mothers and caregivers. Based on social sciences and psychoanalytic theory, anthropologist Gayle Rubin developed an account of a “gender/sex system” (Rubin 1975; Diet 2003, 401; and the entry on feminist perspectives on sex and gender). The gender/gender distinction pointed to “a set of provisions whereby the biological raw material of human sex and procreation are shaped through human and social intervention” (Rubin 1975, 165). Although biological sex was fixed, in Rubin's opinion, gender was a social construct that served to divide the sexes and privilege men. Because gender was mutable, the sex/gender distinction gave feminists a powerful tool to look for ways to address women's oppression.
With this socially constructed notion of gender, early second wave theorists sought an understanding of women as a universal subject and agent of feminist politics. An important set of flaws in feminist thinking since the 1990s is about the questions on the subject of “women.” According to Mary Dietz's 2003 article exposing the camp, there are two large groups here. One defends the category of woman (in the singular and universal), arguing that the specificity of the identity of the woman, her sexual difference with men, must be appreciated and revalued. (The other, discussed below, deals with the diversity of women.) This ""differential feminism"" includes two distinct groups: (i) those who look at how the gender sexual difference is socially constituted and (ii) those who look at how the sexual difference is symbolically and psychoanalytically constructed. The first, the feminism of social differences, includes theories that value motherhood and care and has developed largely in the Anglo-American context. (See, for example, Tronto 1993 and Held 1995.) The second, the feminism of symbolic difference, is that of what is often known as French feminists, including Irigaray, Cixous, and Kristeva. They belong to this group insofar as they value and distinguish the specific sexual difference of women from men. Irigaray's focus on sexual difference is emblematic of this. Social-differential and symbolic-differential feminisms have very little to do with each other, but, Dietz argues, they share the notion that a feminist policy requires a woman of category who has a certain meaning (Dietz 2003, 403; Nicholson 1994, 100).
Just as Marxist theory sought a universal theme in the person of the worker, feminist theorists sought it in a shared and common condition that afflicted women of all cultures. But this notion of universal femininity was interrupted by other thinkers, such as bell hooks, saying it excluded the experience and concerns of non-white and middle-class women. The 1981 book of Hooks titled ""Am I Not a Woman?"" exposed dominant feminism as a movement of a small group of white middle- and upper-class women whose experience was very particular, barely universal. The work of hooks and later Cherrie Moraga, Gloria Anzaldúa, Maria Lugones, Elizabeth Spelman, and others in the foreground the need to account for the multiple and complex identities and experiences of women. In the 1990s debates on whether there was a coherent concept of women who could sustain feminist politics were further challenged by non-Western women by challenging the Western women's movement as trapped in Eurocentric ideals that led to the colonization and domination of the people of the Third World. What is now known as postcolonial theory further accentuated the debate among feminists who wanted to identify a universal feminist issue of women (e.g. Okin, Nussbaum and Ackerly) and those who call for recognition of multiplicity, diversity and intersectionality (e.g. Spivak, Narayan, Mahmood and Jaggar).
The effects of this movement of diversity would be felt more in the 1990s and beyond. Meanwhile, in the 1970s and 1980s feminist theory began to develop in the various areas of social sciences and humanities, and in philosophy began to emerge in what were already different traditions and areas of research. As a branch of political philosophy, feminist political philosophy has often reflected the various divisions in work in political philosophy in general. Before the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War, political philosophy used to be divided into categories such as liberals, conservatives, socialists and Marxists. Except for conservatism, for each category there were often feminists working and criticizing at their side. Therefore, as the classic text of Alison Jaggar, Feminist Politics and Human Nature, explained, each ideological approach attracted feminist scholars who would take their example and take the language of a particular ideology (Jaggar 1983). Jaggar's text brings together feminist political philosophy in four areas: liberal feminism, socialist feminism, Marxist feminism and radical feminism. The first three groups followed the lines of the global political divisions of the Cold War: American liberalism, European socialism and revolutionary communism (although few in the West would embrace Soviet-style communism). Radical feminism was the most indigenous of feminist philosophies, developing its own political vocabulary with its roots in the deep criticism of patriarchy that feminist consciousness had produced in its first and second waves. Otherwise, feminist political philosophy largely followed the lines of traditional political philosophy. But this has never been an uncritical follow-up. As a field bent on changing the world, even liberal feminist theorists tended to criticize liberalism as much or more than they embraced it, and embrace socialism and other more radical views rather than reject them. However, in general, these theorists generally operated within the language and framework of their chosen approach to political philosophy.
Political philosophy began to change enormously in the late 1980s, just before the end of the Cold War, with a new invocation of an old Hegelian category: civil society, an arena of intermediate political life between the state and the home. This was the arena of associations, churches, trade unions, reading clubs, choral societies and many other still public non-governmental organizations. In the 1980s political theorists began to focus their attention from the state to this intermediate kingdom, which suddenly took the center stage in Eastern Europe in organizations that challenged the power of the state and eventually led to the fall of communist regimes.
After the end of the Cold War, political philosophy and political life were radically realigned. New attention was focused on civil society and the public sphere, especially with the timely translation of the early work of Jürgen Habermas, the Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere (Habermas 1989). Volumes soon appeared on civil society and the public sphere, focusing on the ways in which people organized and developed public power rather than on the ways in which the State obtained and exercised its power. Indeed, there was a sense that the public sphere could ultimately exercise more power than the State, at least in the fundamental way in which public will is formed and serves to legitimize State power or not. In the latter sense, John Rawls' work was influential in developing a theory of justice that tied the legitimacy of institutions to the normative judgments that a thoughtful and deliberative people could do (Rawls 1971). In the early 1990s, Marxists seemed to have disappeared or at least become very circumspective (although the fall of communist regimes should not have had any effect on Marxist analysis itself, which never adhered to Leninist or Maoist thought). Socialists also withdrew or became “radical Democrats” (Mouffe 1992, 1993, 2000).",C2
"Hume proposes that feeling, not thought, informs us that an object is beautiful or ugly, or that an action exhibits virtue or vice: “The feeling itself constitutes our praise or admiration” (T, 471). Feeling or feeling is in itself an aesthetic or moral discrimination. It precedes, and the basis of, any subsequent expression of praise or admiration. Feeling is the beauty of the object and is the virtue of desirable human action. Feeling is the only source of values that govern human activity. Taste is a “productive mastery, and shining or staining all natural objects with colors, taken from the inner feeling, raises, in a way, a new creation”. That the new creation is ""beauty and deformity, virtue and vice"" (EPM, 294). However, the feeling is calmer than violent, so an unphilosophic perspective treats it as a property “of the object” (S, 218).
This moral and aesthetic subjectivism attracts Hume for the same reason that attracts Hutcheson. The appeal to feeling offers an intermediate position between the two prevailing theories in English letters, Hobbesian selfishness and ethical rationalism. Hutcheson argues that virtue and beauty are not the qualities of the people and the things to which they are attributed. We can speak as if objects and people have moral and aesthetic properties, but the relevant property is merely an “idea posed in us”. Hume alters Hutcheson's theory by imposing his own philosophical vocabulary, making beauty an impression rather than an idea. But they agree that describing a person as virtuous or such a beautiful object is to make a claim about his tendency to cause a certain response. Is it reckless and “too strong,” Hume asks Hutcheson, to sum up the thesis in the following terms (HL, I, 39–40)? “[When you pronounce any action or character to be vicious, you mean nothing, but from the constitution of your nature you have a feeling or feeling of guilt of contemplation of it. Therefore, vice and virtue can be compared with sounds, colors, heat and cold, which, according to modern philosophy, are not qualities in objects, but perceptions in the mind” (T, 469). Highlighting Hume's debt to Hutcheson, Kivy (2003, pp. 307-310), argues that Hume understands the beauty in the color model a lot. Although they are secondary qualities and therefore do not directly reveal the properties of the object it causes, some perception of color is “true and real” (SOT, 272), and therefore is for Hume equally with beauty. However, virtue and beauty are not strictly analogous to secondary qualities, such as heat and cold, because the claim of a critic that a work is beautiful implies a backing element that does not arise in the observation that the ice is cold. The case against the reading of Humean beauty in the model of ideas of secondary qualities is provided by Shiner (1996) and Taylor (2011).
Hume defends the centrality of feeling with the following reasoning. Recognitions of virtue and beauty require particular feelings in human observers. If the discriminations of taste took place without these feelings, we would lack motivation to do what we consider moral. Moral and aesthetic judgments have practical consequences that lack mere reason. So taste differs from the assent that characterizes understanding or reason (T, 458; EPM, 172; S, 219). Although taste responds to the real qualities of objects, we cannot substitute the exercise of taste for the assent of reason. In many cases, beauty and grace (both aesthetic and moral) are inexplicable; they resist our efforts of explanation, and we must rely on the “safe testimony of taste and feeling” (EPM, 267).",C2
"In 1932 Marcuse published one of the first reviews of the recently published 1844 Manuscripts entitled “Neue Quellen zur Grundlegung des historischen Materialismus” (New Sources on the Foundation of Historical Materialism). According to Marcuse, the manuscripts of 1844 had the possibility of accomplishing two things.
These manuscripts could put on a new basis the discussion about the origins and original meaning of historical materialism, and the whole theory of ""scientific socialism"". They also make it possible to raise the question of the real connections between Marx and Hegel in a more fruitful way. (Wolin 2001: 86)
However, these manuscripts also provided Marcuse with the theoretical tools necessary to develop a critical and philosophical anthropology that would assist him in developing his own brand of critical theory.
In this context, “anthropology” does not refer to the study of past cultures, as is often the case in the United States. Instead, it refers to the German idea of anthropology, which is rather a philosophical and social scientific examination of human nature. The 1844 Manuscripts are important to Marcuse because in them Marx provides a philosophical basis for his subsequent critique of political economy, as well as a philosophical anthropology of theoretical action. Philosophical categories such as work, objectification, alienation, sublation, property, and others explored in Hegel's philosophy were dialectically analyzed by Marx (Kellner 1984: 79).
In short, what Marcuse sees in the manuscripts of 1844 is an analysis of the social conditions for a communist revolution. Revolution itself requires the development of a radical subjectivity. Radical subjectivity refers to the development of a form of self-awareness that finds the current social and economic conditions intolerable. The radical act is a rejection of these conditions and a orientation towards social transformation. To make sense of Marcuse's position, we must ask ourselves: what are these intolerable conditions and how do they occur? Philosophical anthropology and radical subjectivity are connected here to the extent that the intolerable conditions that must overcome revolution or radical act represent social distortions of human essence. It is Marx and Hegel who provided Marcuse with a philosophical anthropology that reveals the human essence and social mechanisms by which it is distorted. The key category here is that of “alienation” which cannot be understood without examining the role of work and objectivity.
According to Marcuse, Hegel and Marx, human beings develop through a self-forming process in which the external world (nature) is appropriate and transformed according to human needs. Work is one of the main areas for this self-training activity. The idea that work is an essential part of a self-training process is what distinguishes Marx from classical economists such as Smith, Richard, etc. In the classical economy, work is simply the means by which individuals make provisions for themselves and their families. In these theories work is not considered as the activity by which the human subject is constituted. The Marxist view of work as a self-forming process is what makes possible the Marxist theory of alienation and revolution.
Marcuse argues that in the Manuscripts of 1844 Marx shows how the role of work is reversed as self-realization or self-forming process. Instead of having its claimed subjectivity, the individual becomes an object that is now shaped by external, alien forces. Therefore, Marx's theory makes a transition from an examination of the self-forming process of work to a critique of the forms of alienation caused by the historical facticity of capitalism. Within the Historical Facticity of Capitalism
this fact appears as the total reversal and concealment of what criticism had defined as the essence of man and human work. Work is not “free activity” or the universal and free self-realization of man, but his slavery and loss of reality. The worker is not man in the totality of his expression of life, but something not essential [ein Unwesen], the purely physical subject of ""abstract"" activity. The objects of work are not expressions and confirmations of the human reality of the worker, but strange things, which belong to someone other than the worker—“basic products.” (Markuse 2005b: 104)
Marcuse will spend the rest of her life carrying out the investigations initiated in these early works. What distinguishes his project from that of Marx is the way in which each one will deal with the problem of concealment mentioned in the above quotation. Marx will develop two different but related approaches. His criticism of the political economy is an attempt to reveal the internal logic of capitalism (how it works) as well as the contradictions that will lead to the collapse of capitalism. The second approach is to elaborate a theory of revolution that presupposes the awakening of self-awareness in the working class. In both approaches, concealment will give way to outreach and social transformation. Earlier we saw that Marx's predictions did not come true for either reason. This failure in part led to what has been called the crisis of Marxism to which the birth of the Frankfurt School was a response. Marcuse's work will go through many phases as he tries to unlock the key to revolutionary action. The next key move for him is to participate in a deeper study of Hegel as a source for critical social theory.",C2
"An influential branch of feminist ethics developed in the last four decades, the ethics of care, is an area of philosophy that implicitly recognizes the assets of personal relationships because “care” is, in itself, a main good of relationship that has been affirmed to play a central role in moral thinking and, more recently, in political thinking.
Perhaps the best way to identify the ethics of care is as a thread of ethics that deals with the satisfaction of the needs of others within personal relationships (Tronto 1993). But “care” is used in feminist ethics to refer to slightly different things (Collins 2015). The reference to needs is the common link between different accounts of the appropriate subject-matter of care ethics. (In this entry, “needs” and “important interests” are used interchangeably.) The ethics of care is, first of all, about a type of work, or work, such as when someone is said to be “careful” of another person in situations such as nursing a baby or caring for a sick person. Some care ethics professionals attribute a special, if not exclusive, moral value to the care of people who are unable to meet the needs in question (Bubeck 1995). This meaning often extends to a wider range of activities such as education or physical and mental health care. According to a second view, the ethics of care refers to close relationships between people, based on a special emotional bond and including a commitment to the well-being of others (Ruddick 1998). Much of the ethics of care, at least in the early stages, has focused on close personal relationships, such as motherhood or friendship; the assumption here is that care satisfies the need for bonding, or attachment (Gheaus 2009: 64). Thirdly, “care” is understood as a willingness to behave in certain ways: to be attentive and sensitive to the needs of others and willing to help them. In this sense, “care” is a virtue, and the ethics of care is a form of virtue ethics. As a virtue, care is a general attitude, opposed to insensitivity and indifference to the needs of others.
Whether understood as an activity, relationship or willingness to meet needs, care has been attributed to universal moral value. Many care ethics professionals were interested in the crucial role of agency care provision and for individual and species survival. First, without receiving attention within relationships, babies are unlikely to survive, let alone thrive (Ruddick 1989). In addition, care is necessary for the existence of people: only within relationships with good caregivers can children acquire moral knowledge and dispositions and, ultimately, full activity (Held 1993). Similarly, some care ethicalists argue that friendship is necessary to develop a rich sense of autonomy, as friends give us the most direct access to particular values and conceptions of good (Friedman 1993) Second, as Eva Kittay argues, care has universal value because most individuals require it to varying degrees throughout their lives beyond childhood or childhood: some of us only during illness and old age, while others — people who are chronically ill or disabled — more or less continuously (Kitay 1999).
Because it is necessary for the creation of people, care ethics professionals have stated that care is more basic to morality than rights and duties, since in their absence most rights are useless. Care being so basic to our survival and flowering provides a presumptive reason to assume that there are duties to ensure that everyone is given sufficient care. It is difficult to determine what some ethical careists think about such a duty, because the ethics of care has been coined, at least in the beginning, in opposition to the language of rights and duties (Gilligan 1982; Noddings 1984). More generally, much of the ethics of care arose from scepticism about moral principles (Collins 2015). Therefore, the question of whether we have a general welfare duty to extend our care to those who seem to be excluded has not received much attention (but for a recent exception see Collins 2013).",C2
"The latest news I heard before boarding a plane to Seoul a few days ago was that North Korea had just fired 100 artillery shells at the sea near the border with South Korea.
Disturbing news from North Korea comes as often as stories that make us laugh in disbelief. The many peculiar, disconcerting and disconcerting developments in Pyongyang make their young ruler, Kim Jung Un, an irresistible target for comedians.
It was difficult to suppress a laugh, for example, when North Korea severely declared a forthcoming Hollywood satirical film to be an act of war and lodged an official complaint with the United Nations.
Those are both sides of North Korea, deliberately terrifying and inadvertently comic. Then there's a third side... the part that makes us gasp with horror.
A one-year investigation conducted by the United Nations found that North Korea is a country whose depth of brutality has no parallel in the contemporary world.
According to the report, North Korea commits murder, torture, slavery and mass famines to terrorize and subdue the population. The stories of refugees who have escaped from North Korea are a chilling reminder that the regime is not only a military threat but is causing a terrible humanitarian crisis.
North Korea is a Fiery Kingdom that at the same time is threatening, strange and brutal. The unpredictability of the regime is one of the factors that enable a small and impoverished State, unable to feed its own people, to face far more powerful rivals.
It is those random, capricious and often dangerous behaviors that allow North Korea to be fragile, fragile and bankrupt, forcing its dazzling and successful neighbor, South Korea, to maintain a constant state of alert, to wonder if its capital can survive an attack across a border that is just 35 miles away.
With its conventional and nuclear arsenals, North Korea manages to sustain the international community, including the United States, fighting for an approach that can neutralize the danger and send a lifeguard to the victims of the cruel regime.
It is tempting to ignore North Korea's antics as haunting, as empty threats. But Pyongyang has launched deadly attacks. For example, in 2010, he bombed a South Korean island about 70 miles from Seoul, killing four people. He could also have launched a torpedo that same year that sank a South Korean navy ship, killing 46. In 2013, the North detonated a nuclear device and threatened to launch a preemptive nuclear attack on the United States.A fourth nuclear test could be imminent.
After the most recent escalation, South Korean President Park Geun-hye spoke to the military leaders and told them to prepare for reprisals. She described Pyongyang as so erratic that you can't see an inch forward.
News from North Korea can be so disconcerting that parody and rumors regularly come to news and social media as if they were made. Before the World Cup finals a satirical video supposedly showing a North Korean newsman declaring the North team as a World Cup finalist went viral, repeated as if it were true, as another fun time for Pyongyang.
And why not? Truth and fiction are hard to tell.
Pyongyang has created its own version of the world for domestic consumption. North Korean government researchers announced that their country is the second happiest country in the world, only second to China. The last ruler, Kim Jung Il, was informed that he had played a perfect game the first time he set foot in a bowling alley. He was also supposed to be the best golfer in the world.
The official biography of the country's rulers has been seen as something outside of a history of Marvel Comics' book. No official biography of the current Kim has been published, apart from a story that says he was born in heaven. That would fit his father's official story, Kim Jong Il, who claims that he was born under a double rainbow with the seasons changing spontaneously and a new star appearing in the sky for the occasion.
The three generations of Kim men who have ruled the North are painted as supernatural to the local population. Abroad, they are cartoon figures, whose behavior can leave diplomats and strategists scratching their heads.
Just a few months ago, the government published a racist diatribe against President Barack Obama, calling him a clown who does not even have the basic appearance of being human. I suggested he lived with monkeys in a zoo. Racism, a myth of racial superiority, is a notable feature of the culture promoted by the regime.
The authorities have created their own reality, brainwashing the population to maintain the functioning of the State and the safe regime. For anyone who commits what the government considers a violation, the punishment is inconceivably harsh.
It's all part of the riddle that keeps the world guessing, disbalancing and nervous. By firing missiles, threatening neighbors and acting erratically, North Korea presents itself as mysterious and volatile, and even that perception magnifies its ability to create fear, increasing its power and helping to keep the despotic regime in control.

"The value realism of truth is the view that every well-formed mathematical affirmation has a unique and objective truth value that is independent of whether it can be known by us and whether it is logically derived from our current mathematical theories. The view also holds that most of the mathematical statements that are considered true are in fact true. So the realism of the value of truth is clearly a metaphysical vision. But unlike Platonism, it is not an ontological view. Because while true value realism claims that mathematical statements have unique and objective truth values, it is not committed to the distinctively Platonist idea that these truth values must be explained in terms of mathematical object ontology.
Mathematical Platonism clearly motivates realism of real value by providing an account of how mathematical statements get their true values. But the first opinion does not imply the second, unless more premises are added. Because even if there are mathematical objects, referential and quantitative indetermination can deprive mathematical statements of a unique and objective truth value. On the contrary, the realism of truth-value does not itself imply Existence and therefore does not imply either object realism or Platonism. Because there are several accounts of how mathematical statements can come to possess unique and objective truth values that do not pose a realm of mathematical objects. [6]
In fact, many nominalists support the realism of truth-value, at least on more basic branches of mathematics, such as arithmetic. Nominalists of this kind are committed to the slightly strange opinion that, although the ordinary mathematical assertion
(1) There are prime numbers between 10 and 20.
is true, in fact there are no mathematical objects and therefore in particular there are no numbers. But there is no contradiction here. We must distinguish between the LM language in which mathematicians make their statements and the LP language in which nominalists and other philosophers make their own. The statement (1) is made in LM. But the nominalist's claim that (1) is true but that there are no abstract objects is made in LP. Therefore, the statement of the nominalist is perfectly consistent provided that (1) is translated from LM to LP in a non-homofonic manner. And in fact, when the nominalist states that the truth values of LM prayers are fixed in a way that does not attract mathematical objects, it is precisely this kind of non-homophonic translation that he has in mind. The view mentioned in the previous note provides an example.
This shows that for the Existence statement to have its intended effect, it must be expressed in the LP language used by us philosophers. If the claim was expressed in the LM language used by mathematicians, then nominalists could accept the claim while still denying that there are mathematical objects, contrary to the purpose of the claim.
A small but important tradition of philosophers calls for the debate on Platonism to be replaced by, or at least transformed into, a debate on the realism of the value of truth. One reason offered in support of this view is that the first debate is irretrievably unclear, while the second is easier to deal with (Dummett 1978a, pp. 228-232 and Dummett 1991b, pp. 10–15). Another reason offered is that the debate about the realism of the value of truth is of greater importance for both philosophy and mathematics than the debate about Platonism. [7]

"The deadly attack in Kabul on the Shiite faithful celebrating the festival of Ashura adds yet another layer to the overlapping security crises in the country. And they evoke violent sectarian rivalries in Iraq and Pakistan, where the animosity between Sunnis and Shiites is deep. Afghanistan has its own cultural divisions -- between the Pashtun and Tajik ethnic groups, for example -- but it is rare to see such an explosion of religiously motivated violence.
Kate Clark, with the Afghan Analyst Network in Kabul, described the attack as a real shock.
Whatever happened in the last 30 years we haven't had this kind of sectarian attack aimed at killing a lot of people, he told CNN on the phone from the Afghan capital.
The first claim of responsibility for the bombing in the Afghan capital comes from a Sunni militant group in Pakistan with a history of sectarian attacks against Shia. A man who identified himself as a spokesman for Lashkar-e-Janghvi al-Almi, a group with links to al-Qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack in an appeal to Radio Mashaal, a Pashto-Language station in Pakistan sponsored by the United States government. A similar call was reportedly made to the BBC Urdu language service.
The group is a branch of the powerful Lashkar-e-Janghvi-LRB-LeJ-RRB, which has a history of high-profile suicide attacks in Pakistan, including the attack on the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad in 2008. Al-Almi's most destructive attack to date was a double suicide bombing in north-west Pakistan last year. The bombers, wearing burkas, killed 42 people belonging to tribes opposed to the Pakistani Taliban, also known for their antipathy towards the Shiites.
If Al-Almi's assertion were valid, it would not surprise some Afghan Shia, who hastened to point out some form of Pakistani involvement in Tuesday's attacks.
LeJ has a long history of attacking the Shia Hazara community in Pakistan. The Hazaras are numerous in both Pakistan and Afghanistan, and constitute a large part of the Shia minority in Afghanistan. They have suffered decades of persecution in both countries, and Sunni militants have often then painted as collaborators of the occupying powers.
This year, apparently in retaliation for the murder of Osama bin Laden, LeJ shot and killed several Hazara in Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province, and also home to Afghan Taliban political leaders. In a subsequent open letter, the LeJ warned: We will rid Pakistan of -LSB- this -RSB - impure people. Pakistan means land of cigars, and Shiites have no right to be here.
In October, Sunni militants killed dozens more from Hazara. In one case, they stopped a bus of Shia pilgrims on their way to Iran from Pakistan Balochistan and shot 26 male passengers in front of their families.
Lashkar-e-Jhangvi has obviously not been active in Afghanistan since he maintained training camps there during the Taliban government in the 1990s. However, other Sunni militants -- especially factions among the Pakistani Taliban -- have established a presence in some Afghan border provinces. And regional analysts perceive fluid links, contacts and cross-fertilization among the countless groups operating in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region.
The Taliban hastened to repudiate and condemn the attacks. Kate Clark says that while he is prudent about the Taliban's denial, such an attack would disagree with the Taliban leaders' claim to be a national movement, and is not part of a pattern of such attacks by the group.
Clark also notes that last month, in his Eid message, Mullah Omar urged Taliban fighters to protect the lives, wealth and honor of ordinary people. That said, 80 percent of all civilian deaths in Afghanistan are attributed to the armed opposition; and the orders of the Shura of Quetta, as is known, are only applied irregularly by field commanders. The Taliban are not a monolith, as an Afghan observer says, and there may have been collaboration at the local level between a Taliban operation and LeJ.
The Taliban have not played the sectarian card since they became an insurgency. But when they were in power in the 1990s they brutally persecuted the Hazara community of Afghanistan. Human Rights Watch documented two massacres in Hazara in 2000 and 2001 by Taliban forces. And after capturing Mazar and Sharif in 1998, Taliban fighters killed hundreds of Hazara in retaliation for the mass execution of their own soldiers the previous year.
Since the overthrow of the Taliban, Afghanistan’s hazaras have prospered: in higher education, government and military, and have embraced new democratic processes. The annual Ashura celebration in Kabul has become more elaborate. That may have been enough temptation for the Hazarasenemies.
If Tuesday's bombings were an attempt to sow sectarian struggles in Afghanistan, the most obvious thing is that they imitate Al Qaeda in Iraq, which when led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi tried to ignite a sectarian war between Sunnis and the country's Shiite majority in a series of attacks directed at Shiite sacred occasions and shrines.
Kate Clark of the Afghan Network of Analysts believes that moderation will prevail in Afghanistan. Hazara leaders have already asked their community to remain calm and do not gag the hook offered by these attacks. Everywhere, Clark says, there is an understanding that sectarian conflict is a situation in which tet-for-tat attacks would take hundreds of lives.

"The investigation found that farmers were willing to participate in crop insurance in the municipality of Dormaa in the Bono region of Ghana. The essential information of 167 respondents who were chosen using a multistage sampling method for the study was collected through a structured questionnaire. The elements influencing the preparation for crop protection by cocoa producers were assessed using the probit regression model and, finally, the limitations of cocoa producers were assessed using the Kendall concordance coefficient. The study found that the average amount farmers were eager to pay was GH215.59 per year for crop insurance. Most 96.7 per cent of respondents were eager to participate in crop insurance, but 3.3 per cent of respondents were unwilling to participate. Important factors influencing farmers ' preparation for crop insurance include age, marital status, access to extension service and experience in cocoa farming. Again, the main limitation affecting farmers was pests and diseases. The study therefore recommends that agricultural extension agents and other stakeholders in agricultural insurance raise farmers' awareness of the importance of crop insurance policy. Insurance companies must provide crop insurance to farmers at moderate rates of GH¢ 215.59 per year to encourage their participation.
Keywords: Harvest insurance, cocoa, probit regression, Dormaa municipal assembly, Ghana.
Introduction
Agriculture is central to the economy of each emerging nation, including Ghana, as it uses about 66 per cent of Ghana ' s labour force, both formal and casual. The agricultural subsector grew by 4.8% in 2018, in contrast to a development rate of 6.1% in 2017. The share of the gross domestic product of agriculture decreased from 21.1% in 2017 to 19.7% in 2018. Crops are another important commitment in Ghana to a portion of 14.5% of gross domestic product (Ghana Statistical Service, 2019). Although the contribution of agriculture to Ghana's gross domestic product has declined over the years, it remains a powerful force in the economy (ISSER, 2011). A key profitable area and a major source of export earnings for Ghana in recent years has been cocoa. Briesinger et al. (2011) showed an increase in the percentage of cocoa in agricultural gross domestic product from 13.7 per cent in 2000 to 2004 to 18.9 per cent in 2005/06. The crucial role of cocoa in Ghana's income, in addition to the reality that it helps as a key source of work for many Ghanaian farmers, implies its future in the face of any unexpected conditions must be assured. This is because any significant disaster in this sector will negatively affect both the macroeconomic and microeconomic areas of the economy. Although the danger in the agricultural sector is inevitable, it can be managed.
Annual cocoa production differs significantly due to unforeseen weather conditions, pest and disease invasions and sporadic economic situations that cause crops and prices to move widely. More attention should be paid to cocoa production in order to increase Ghana ' s income and, in addition, to help solve food security problems in some parts of the country.
According to Oluyole and Sanusi (2009), previous research acknowledged some significant explanations behind differences in cocoa production that include low harvest, environmental impulses, extreme weather situations, occurrence of infections, pest invasion and regular hazards such as heavy downpours, erosion and long dry seasons. High risks and uncertainties related to agricultural production have been attributed to the decline in cocoa production (Aderinola and Abdulkadri, 2007). This is because, like other crops, cocoa needs a wide and uninterrupted interaction with the forces of nature. These threats and vulnerabilities are unforeseen and beyond the capacity of agricultural households; subsequently, farmers can only cope with them. Cocoa farmers suffer enormous savings and income losses due to the losses suffered by these dangers and uncertainties. In light of this, Ajakaiye and Adeyeye (2001) discovered that smallholder households in many emerging nations of the world, without exception to Ghana, are trapped in the insane pattern of insufficiency. This succession is represented by the low production and low yields of the farm, causing virtually no savings of funds, necessary for the revolution of its agricultural expedition, which adds to the low position conferred on farmers within the population. On the contrary, Quagranie (2006) prescribed that insurance could be used to reduce the financial costs of numerous hostile events, such as deaths, accidents, thefts and weather damage. Insurance is defined as an agreement between two parties in which a party called an insurer accepts an exchange called a premium to pay the other party a fixed measure of money in the event of a sudden incident (Adams 1995). As Sarris (2002) indicates, insurance guarantees a basic cost for an explicit amount for a fixed duration for which the security network provider pays a direct premium. However, insurance offers the possibility for companies to replace risk with a known rate. People acquire insurance coverage in the hope of receiving a sum, at any time that the policyholder finds the protection assured misfortune (Nimo et al., 2011). As indicated by Aidoo et al. (2014), a large part of Ghana's insurance agencies offer numerous protection schemes (e.g. accident coverage, medical and life coverage, fire protection and theft) in addition to the crop insurance scheme.",C2
"The threat of extinction of the tiger in India, the dangerous existence of the orangutan in Indonesia, the difficult situation of the panda: these are wildlife emergencies with which we have become familiar. They are very dear animals that no one wants to see disappear. But, now, scientists fear that the real impact of declining wildlife may be closer to home, threatening creatures like mariquitas that pose the greatest threat to biodiversity.
Climate change, the decrease in the number of animals, the increase in the number of human beings and the rapid rate of extinction of species mean that an increasing number of scientists now declare us in the Anthropocene, the geological age of extinction when humans finally dominate ecosystems.
The WWF Living Planet Index 2014 seemed to confirm that grim image, with statistics on the world's wild population showing a dramatic reduction in the number of species. The LPI showed that the number of vertebrates had decreased by 52% over four decades. The loss of biodiversity has now reached “critical levels. ” Some populations of mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians have suffered even greater losses, with a decrease in freshwater species of 76 per cent during the same period.
But it is the creatures that provide the most “natural capital” or “ecosystem services” that are putting many scientists really worried. Three quarters of world food production is believed to depend on bees and other pollinators such as aerodynamic flies. No matter how cute a panda is or how impressive a tiger is – it is the worms that are crushing our waste and taking it deep into the ground to become nutrients, and the bats that are catching mosquitoes and keeping malaria rates low. A study in North America has valued the loss of pest control by ongoing bat declines at over $22 billion in lost agricultural productivity.
“It is the loss of the common species that will impact people, not so much on the rarest creatures because, by the very nature of their rarity, we do not depend on them in such an obvious way,” said Dr. Nick Isaac, a macroecologist at the Oxfordshire Center for Ecology and Hydrology. He says the recent work he and his colleagues have been doing suggests that Britain’s insects and other invertebrates are decreasing as fast as vertebrates, with “serious consequences for humanity.” “The really interesting thing about this work is that we’re learning that it’s not just about the number of species that are extinct, but about the real numbers of a population; that’s the beginning of a fundamental change in our understanding,” he says.
He noted that between 23 and 36 per cent of all birds, mammals and amphibians used for food or medicine are now in danger of extinction. In many parts of the world, wildlife food sources are a critical part of the diet, especially for the poor.
Most people agree that unsustainable human consumption damages ecosystems, creating climate change and destroying habitats at a much faster rate than was thought. But, this time, it is not only the “big and tender mammals” that we have to worry about losing, but the smaller and less visible creatures on which we depend – insects, creepy ones – kittens and even worms. They may not face immediate extinction, but a decrease in their number will affect us all. “We will feel the impact of those losses. With UK species, the pattern is the same with invertebrates as with vertebrates. It's not as simplistic as ""fish dies and people starve"" – it's more complex,"" Isaac said.
Humans, television naturalist Sir David Attenborough said in 2013, are a “plague on earth,” but WWF claims there is still time to stop rotting. His UK Executive Director, David Nussbaum, said: “The extent of the destruction highlighted in this report must act as a wake-up call for all of us. All – politicians, companies and people – have an interest, and a responsibility, to act to ensure that we protect what we all value: a healthy future for people and nature.
“Human beings are cutting down trees faster than they can grow again, harvesting more fish than the oceans can replenish, pumping water out of our rivers and aquifers faster than rains can replenish and emitting more carbon than oceans and forests can absorb,” he said.

"The new laws that will enter into force on Sunday cover some of the nation's most controversial issues, from immigration to abortion, while others deal with tanning beds, tuition and where you can sell a pet.
In total, nearly 40,000 laws were enacted in 2011, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Some of them take effect on New Year's Day.
Among them is a controversial California provision that requires schools to add lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans to the list of those whose contributions to the development of California and the United States should be taught in schools.
Another California law adds gender identity and gender expression to the list of characteristics that require equal rights.
New laws in Delaware and Hawaii make same-sex couples eligible for civil unions and grant them the same rights and benefits as couples married under the law, the legislative group said.
NCSL: New state laws for the new year
In New Hampshire, as of January 1, children will have to inform their parents before they abort or apply for a court order to avoid parental notification.
Governor. John Lynch had vetoed the bill, saying there must be an exception for rape, incest and abuse. The legislature repealed its veto.
New laws in Louisiana, Tennessee, South Carolina, and Georgia require companies to enroll in the federal E-Verify program to ensure employees are eligible to work in the United States, says the National Conference of State Legislatures.
California, meanwhile, is banning any state or local government office from requiring employers to use E-Verify, unless required by federal law as a condition for receiving federal funds.
E-Verify is a controversial program designed to check the citizenship or immigration status of a potential employee. Supporters say it helps businesses avoid involuntary recruitment of illegal immigrants. Critics complain that it's expensive to operate, push undocumented workers underground, and it's not always accurate.
Some future laws for the new year focus on health issues.
One in California prohibits the production or sale of beer to which caffeine has been added. Another in the state would ban the sale of dextromethorphan, or DXM, to minors without a prescription. DXM is in many over-the-counter cough suppressors, but it has been used as a recreational drug, says the National Conference of State Legislatures.
California will also prohibit stores from selling expired infant formulas and foods.
Another law in California focuses on school athletes suspected of having a concussion or head injury. A school should withdraw the athlete from that activity and not allow him to resume it until a health care provider gives him the approval.
Many of the new laws cited by the legislative group are in California, including one that prohibits the use of ultraviolet tanning devices by minors and another that makes it a crime to sell a live animal on any street, road, right of public passage, parking, carnival or promenade.
Both Oregon and California will ban the sale of shark fins in the new year.
Oregon is demanding that state colleges and universities waive the tuition and tuition fees of children under the age of 25.
Some new state laws amend penal provisions. Kentucky will require certain inmates convicted of drug offences to serve the last six months of their community sentences under supervision.
Oregon will require ignition interlocking devices -- computer breath analyzers -- for people convicted of driving under influence and people under intoxicant distraction agreements, which allow for delayed prosecution for a DUI charge.
And more states are joining a national movement by tougher laws against distracted driving. Nevada will ban all drivers from texting and using portable devices, says the National Conference of State Legislatures. North Dakota is banning drivers under the age of 18 from using cell phones in their cars and forbidding all drivers from sending text messages.

"Tokyo -LRB-CNN -RRB- A Japanese court has issued a court order to stop plans to restart two nuclear reactors in the west of the country, citing security concerns, a court official told CNN.
The nuclear warden of Japan, the Nuclear Regulatory Authority, had previously given a green light to the reopening of reactors 3 and 4 at the Takahama nuclear power plant of Kansai power company.
But the locals successfully petitioned the court in Fukui Prefecture, where the plant is located, raising concerns about whether the reactors would survive a strong earthquake.
Japan's 48 nuclear reactors are disconnected following the Fukushima disaster in 2011, when a tsunami triggered by a massive earthquake sent a water wall to the power plant.
Since then, the island nation has imported larger quantities of expensive natural gas and coal to meet its energy needs.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pressed for a return to nuclear power, arguing that it is essential for the country's economic recovery to reduce utility bills that are triggered by energy imports.
But opinion polls have consistently shown public opposition to a nuclear restart.
Keith Henry, general manager of Tokyo-based Asia Strategy, who advises companies on Japanese public policy issues, says the decision will force Abe to rethink the economy of its energy policy.
That was a blow to the body - LSB - for Abe - because it is no longer a political matter, it is a legal matter. Change the calculus and dynamics, he said.
He's in court now. And the government has no power to do anything about it.

Anti-nuclear activists celebrated after the Fukui District Court decision in their favor on Tuesday.
The nuclear plant operator had argued in court that the plant was safe, complying with the strictest safety standards introduced by the nuclear warden after the Fukushima disaster.
He said in a statement that scientific and professional findings showed that reactor safety was assured.
But the court ruled that the new security regulations were loose, lacked rationality and could not guarantee the safety of the plant, one official said.
The electric company said it would appeal the decision. We deeply regret that our statement has not been well understood and cannot be accepted at all, he said in a statement.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters on Tuesday that the country's nuclear warden had considered the plant safe according to the world's highest safety standards.
The government had no intention of changing the course of its planned nuclear restart, he said.
Takahama was one of two nuclear facilities authorized to resume operations.
The Sendai nuclear power plant in Kagoshima Prefecture has been approved by the governor of the prefecture to reopen the courtroom, although local residents are trying to challenge it in court.
Analyst Henry said that the renewable energy sector could benefit from Takahama's decision, as the country weighed solar and hydropower as alternatives.
Before the Fukushima disaster, approximately 30% of Japan's energy was nuclear.
CNN Junko Ogura contributed to this report from Tokyo.

"Calculus, originally called infinitesimal calculus or ""the calculus of infinitesimals"", is the mathematical study of continuous change, in the same way that geometry is the study of form and algebra is the study of generalizations of arithmetical operations.
It has two main branches, differential calculus and integral calculus; the first refers to instantaneous rates of change, and slope curves, while the integral calculus refers to the accumulation of quantities, and low areas or between curves. These two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus, and use the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to a well-defined limit. [1]
The infinitesimal calculus was independently developed in the late 17th century by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. [2][3] Today, calculus has widespread uses in science, engineering and economics. [4]
In mathematical education, calculus denotes elementary mathematical analysis courses, which are mainly devoted to the study of functions and limits. The word calculus (plural calculus) is a Latin word, which originally means ""small pebble"" (this meaning is maintained in medicine – see Calculus (medicine)). Because such pebbles were used for the calculation, the meaning of the word has evolved and today usually means a method of calculation. Therefore, it is used to name specific methods of calculation and related theories, such as propositional calculus, Ricci calculus, calculus of variations, lambda calculus, and process calculus.
Differential calculus is the study of the definition, properties, and applications of the derivative of a function. The process of finding the derivative is called differentiation. Given a function and a point in the domain, the derivative at that point is a way to encode the small-scale behavior of the function near that point. When you find the derivative of a function at each point of your domain, it is possible to produce a new function, called the derivative function or only the derivative of the original function. In formal terms, the derivative is a linear operator that takes a function as its input and produces a second function as its output. This is more abstract than many of the processes studied in elementary algebra, where functions usually enter a number and output another number. For example, if the duplication function is given input three, then it comes out six, and if the square function is given input three, then it comes out nine. The derivative, however, can take the function of square as an input. This means that the derivative takes all the information from the square function—like two is sent to four, three is sent to nine, four is sent to sixteen, and so on—and uses this information to produce another function. The function produced by the derivation of the square function turns out to be the duplication function.
In more explicit terms, the ""duplicate function"" can be denoted by g(x) = 2x and the ""quad function"" by f(x) = x2. The ""derivative"" now takes the function f(x), defined by the expression ""x2"", as an input, which is all the information—like two is sent to four, three is sent to nine, four is sent to sixteen, and so on—and uses this information to produce another function, the function g(x) = 2x, as it will result.
The most common symbol for a derivative is an apostrophe brand called prime. So, the derivative of a function called f is denoted by f′, pronounced ""f prime"". For example, if f(x) = x2 is the square function, then f′(x) = 2x is its derivative (the duplication function g above). This notation is known as Lagrange's notation.
If the input of the function represents time, then the derivative represents the change with respect to time. For example, if f is a function that takes a time as input and gives the position of a ball at that moment as output, then the derivative of f is how the position is changing in time, that is, it is the velocity of the ball.",C2
"Tempier's conviction is only one of the approximately sixteen censored thesis lists that were published at the University of Paris during the 13th and 14th centuries. Most of these proposition lists were grouped into systematic collections of prohibited items. One of the first of these collections of medieval condemned articles originated at the end of the 13th century under the name of Parisian articles or also Collectio errorum in anglia et parisius condempnatorum. Initially this collection consisted of twenty-two chapters presenting the errors condemned in 1277 by Archbishop Robert Kilwardby in Oxford, in 1241 by Bishop William of Alvernia in Paris, and in 1270 and 1277 by Bishop Stephen Tempier in Paris (in this order).
During the 14th century, this Collection grew significantly, so, in fact, a second augmented Collection came into existence. All the proposals added to the first compilation had been condemned in the fourteenth century at the University of Paris. It can be seen as a collection of verdicts, which at the opening of each new set of verdicts provides information about the parties involved and the date. The verdicts are not motivated, nor does the collection account for the facts (narratio).
The collection of Parisian articles must have had some sort of official status, and must have circulated among medieval scholars. On the other hand, many medieval philosophical and theological texts contain references and quotations of “Parisian articles”, which in no way should always be identified with Tempier’s list of condemned articles.
If one compares Tempier's program 1277 with the other lists of errors gathered in the compilation of Parisian articles, two characteristics stand out, namely the anonymity of its objectives and its promulgation by a bishop. Tempier does not specify the people behind the false views, but simply states that the errors were spread by ""certain scholars in the faculty of the arts."" The other convictions, however, all refer to specific scholars whose names are explicitly mentioned in the Collectio errorum. Moreover, it is one of the few censorships in which a bishop was involved from the beginning, and not, for example, at a later stage of the proceedings as an appellate judge.
In his introductory letter to the bug program, Tempier indicates that he responded to information received from important people (magnarum et gravium personarum crebra zelque fidei accensa insintiavit relatio). The allegations were that “some art scholars in Paris” (nonnulli Parisius studios in artibus) had transgressed the limits of their own faculty (proprietary powers of surplus limits). In all probability, this complaint originated in theological circles.
In his introductory letter, Tempier also reports that he sought the advice “not only from the doctors of Holy Scripture, but also from other wise men” (tam doctorum sacrae Scripturae, quam aliorum prudent virorum communicato consilio). From other suspicious teaching cases we know that the task of theologians was to examine certain works and draw up a list of errors. In cases where a list of alleged errors already existed, theologians were in charge of assessing the degree of error of the listed propositions. The theologian John of Pouilly reports that sixteen teachers of theology were Tempier's advisers to the conviction. One of the members of the commission was Henry of Ghent, as he himself testified in his Quodlibet II. It is unknown when these teachers met, but it must have been after Henry of Ghent had become a regent master in theology, a position he obtained in 1276. That there were some tensions between Tempier and theologians is attested by Giles of Rome, a contemporary testimony of the events of 1277: he affirmed that some articles were condemned not on the basis of the counsel of the teachers, but rather because of the ""obstinity of a few."" This observation has been taken in relation to Tempier, but it could also have included some of the ""wise men"" who had helped him.",C2
"Cities often do not decide to pack, get up and move along the way. But that is exactly what Kiruna, an Arctic city in northern Sweden, has to do – to avoid being swallowed up on earth.
“It’s a dystopian choice,” says Krister Lindstedt, from White, the Stockholm-based architect’s firm, charged with the biblical task of driving this city away 23,000 people from a gigantic iron mine that is quickly swallowing the ground under its streets. “Or the mine must stop digging, creating massive unemployment, or the city has to move – or face some destruction. It is an existential problem.”
Founded in 1900 by the state mining company Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara (LK), Kiruna has been enriched with the vast seam of iron ore below the city, but now faces destruction by the same phenomenon that created its wealth. “We are symbiotic: the city is here because of the mine,” says Deputy Mayor Niklas Siren. Otherwise, no devil would have built a city here.
Located 145 km within the Arctic Circle, Kiruna is subject to a brutal climate, durable winters without sunlight and medium temperatures below -15C. But the deep deposit of magnetite has proven to be a magnet strong enough to keep people here. Driven by the insatiable global appetite for construction, the mine has become the largest underground iron-gold extraction site in the world, producing 90% of all iron in Europe, enough to build more than six Eiffel towers a day. And demand continues to grow.
In 2004, the mining company broke with the city that its days were numbered: digging its wells towards the city at an angle of 60 degrees, the subsidence would soon lead to the general cracking and collapse of the city's buildings. A decade later, fissures are beginning to appear on the ground, crawling closer and closer to the city.
“The people of Kiruna have been living in limbo for ten years,” says Viktoria Walldin, a social anthropologist who works with architects. “They have put their lives on hold, unable to make important decisions such as buying a house, redecorating, having a child or opening a business.”
After years of dilation, the city has finally unveiled a master plan for how it will proceed. “Imagine it as a millift of a city,” says Lindstedt, developing a plan that shows the streets and squares of the city that start crawling eastwards on a new high street, until the whole place has moved safely out of the mine road by 2033.
A new city square is already underway, 3 km east, with a circular town hall planned by the Danish architect Henning Larsen, while 20 key buildings have been identified to be dismantled and resurrected piece by piece in their new home, as a large-scale flat Ikea package. The rusty red wood church of Kiruna, built in 1912 in a form reminiscent of the Sami indigenous tipis, and once voted the most beautiful building in Sweden, will occupy the place in a new park, while the cast iron bell tower will be placed once again on the town hall. But not everything will be saved.
“I talked to an old woman who passes by the bank every day where she received her first kiss,” Walldin says. “It’s things like that – the hospital where your first child was born, for example – that are important to people’s sense of identity and all that will disappear.”
The mining company has allocated the equivalent of Pound320 million to the project for the construction of new facilities, including a secondary school, a fire station, a community centre, a library and a swimming room. But the main concern of most people is where they will actually live and what process will determine the allocation of housing.
“These details have not yet been determined,” admits Lindstedt. “People are used to very low rents and very high incomes, but in the future, this will have to change.” LK has agreed to compensate residents for the value of their homes plus 25%, but many locals say this is not enough to pay for a new construction house at market prices.
To facilitate the valuation process, architects have monitored housing rentals in nearby cities over a period of years, and have “labelled” the homes in Kiruna with the assets they own, from the internal space and gardens to the proximity to the bus stops and the city center. They have also proposed a “Kiruna Gate, ” a kind of massive rescue yard, where materials can be brought from condemned houses and hopefully recycled into the construction of new buildings, although, as Sweden has no tradition of self-construction, it is difficult to see this take off.
A closer look at the plan shows that the new city has little relation to the original Kiruna at all. The current city is an extensive suburban network of winding streets, home to single-family houses with gardens. White's plan incorporates a much higher density arrangement of multi-story apartment blocks around shared courtyards, bordering straight boulevards, downwards, which the icy winds will climb.
It is an opportunity, say the architects, for Kiruna to “reinvent” in a model of sustainable development, attracting young people who would not have stayed in the city before, with new cultural facilities and “visionary” things like a cable car that jumps over the street. But it is a vision that many of the existing residents seem unlikely to be able to afford.

"The current selection of Boeing and SpaceX as suppliers of a U.S.-based capacity. to bring humans to the International Space Station - LRB-ISS -RRB- is an important milestone in the nearly six decades of history of space exploration. It's just the last sign that the old paradigm of government-only space travel is being replaced by something else, a new business ecosystem made up of new relationships between NASA and the aerospace industry.
NASA will no longer own the ISS truck company... specifying each nut and bolt. Instead, NASA is buying services from the American industry. Undoubtedly, the new announcement made it clear that NASA will carefully examine the safety aspects of each design. But the designs will remain those of Boeing and SpaceX and researched by NASA.
I think this new approach is America's secret weapon in what some have described as a space race with China. And, as far as I can tell, while the rest of the world is still stuck in an almost government-only mode, NASA, with the support of the Obama administration, is unleashing the creativity of American know-how.
Starting with the competition of NASA Commercial Orbital Transportation Services, continuing with the Commercial Resupply Services -LRB- Cargo -RRB- and now with the selection of Commercial Crew, NASA bet on the farm in commercial companies filling the void left by the removal of the space shuttle, with the Commercial Crew -LRB-SpaceX and Boeing -RRB companies replacing the Russians in bringing NASA astronauts to the ISS. This will allow NASA to invest savings in deep space capabilities such as SLS and Orion.
I think it is essential that both commercial cargo and crew succeed for at least two reasons: First, the proper role of NASA can be summed up in three words: Explore Deep Space. It is time for NASA to deliver the low-Earth orbit work to industry, while NASA focuses on bringing humanity to Mars, following the footsteps of Robotic Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity Rovers. Second, history teaches us that without an edge of commercial exploitation and profitability, large-scale exploration, routine human effort will not succeed.
As an aerospace professional and former NASA executive, I have found for decades many concepts for private space exploration. Until a few years ago, none of these ideas came across the smell test for what I call the practical visionary, that is, someone capable of seeing a new future, but solidly based on the lessons learned. There was always something missing in these early ventures: either the technical approach required that some unobtanium technology be invented, the defender had good ideas but neither money nor construction and philosophy would arrive showed total naivety in business and marketing.
Today's selection points us in a different direction. As with early 20th-century air mail routes that helped stimulate aviation, NASA's commercial programs are now the anchor tenants in the government's transfer of space services to the private sector. This, in turn, will enable a new solid company and allow NASA to focus on Mars, the ultimate goal for exploration.

"According to experts, North Korea's latest nuclear test, following the successful launch of the December satellite, suggests that Pyongyang is moving towards the development of a nuclear warhead and deliverable missile system. The question remains: How close is it?
The answer, like the closing hermit kingdom, remains largely a mystery, as does much of its nuclear program.
It's a question about the delivery system and the reliability of those systems, said Daniel Pinkston, senior analyst at the International Crisis Group covering Northeast Asia. That is essentially unknown, or known to a few people within North Korea.
South Korean rocket successfully puts satellite in orbit
A 2009 report by the International Crisis Group suggests that North Korea probably has between six and twelve nuclear weapons, or at least explosive devices, but points out that experts are divided into whether one of these weapons is now usable as warheads, small enough to be mounted on missiles and durable enough to withstand the dangers of flight.
It is quite clear that these are advanced technologies and systems present a number of engineering challenges, and mastering these technologies requires a series of tests, Pinkston said.
North Korea in Google Maps: Monuments, nuclear complex, gulags
In December, on the first anniversary of the death of former leader Kim Jong Il, North Korea successfully launched a three-stage rocket that orbited the Shining Star-3 satellite. The launch also noted that the North's long-range missile programme now puts the United States at hand.
Last month, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution that strengthened sanctions against the North in response to the rocket launch in December. Declaring that the sanctions amounted to a declaration of war, North Korea threatened to conduct more nuclear and missile tests, which, he said, are a new phase of confrontation with the United States.
For the UN and North Korea: Game in
Tuesday's underground nuclear test is North Korea's third, after testing in 2009 and 2006. The test, probably carried out near P'unggye, produced several kilotons, according to assessments cited by the U.S. director of national intelligence.
Koreas in 2013: Watch Generational Policy · Global Voices
Estimates of the size, or performance, of the 2009 nuclear test range from 2.5 kilotons to 6 kilotons, Pinkston said. In comparison, the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima had a yield of 16 kilotons.
While the spectre of a North Korea capable of sending nuclear-powered missiles is worrying, equally problematic for the international community is Pyongyang's atomic technology that feeds the black arms market.
If his clandestine uranium enrichment program has made progress, Pyongyang could prove that he will gain access to a much larger stockpile of fissile material than simply his limited supply of weapon-grade plutonium, wrote Patrick M. Cronin, an Asian expert at the Center for New American Security, in a CNN op-ed. A greater stock of fissile material is a dual threat: as a vital part of an expanded nuclear weapons programme and as a commodity to be sold on the black market.

"President Obama announced Friday that NATO will develop a missile defense system to safeguard most of Europe and the United States.
The agreement, according to the president, followed a year of discussions to determine the best ways to coordinate efforts to protect members of the 61-year-old alliance.
The system would be strong enough to cover the entire territory and European populations of NATO, as well as the United States, Obama told journalists in Lisbon, Portugal.
The missile defense plan provides a role for all our allies in response to the threats of our times, the president said. It shows our determination to protect our citizens from the threat of ballistic missiles.
Obama addressed journalists on the first day of what he promised would be a historic summit with leaders from all 28 NATO member countries, as well as Russia. By the end of Saturday, the alliance aimed to produce a set of new initiatives aimed at revitalizing and redirecting NATO 20 years after the end of the Cold War.
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen announced on Friday that the Heads of State had agreed on a new mission statement, calling it the alliance's road map for the next 10 years. The development of this so-called strategic concept had been one of the main priorities of the meeting, which Rasmussen considered last month to be one of the most important summits in the history of our partnership.
This strategic concept confirms the commitment of NATO members to defend each other against the attack, and that will never change, Rasmussen said in Lisbon. But it also modernises the way NATO defends itself in the 21st century.
The document, prepared on the basis of recommendations made by a panel led by former United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, sought to take advantage of NATO's work in Afghanistan to redefine the alliance as a global actor who would work with regional partners to combat threats outside Europe.
Under the new plan, NATO will strengthen its role in counterinsurgency efforts, as well as in the stabilization and reconstruction of key countries, according to Rasmussen. The defence alliance will also develop a permanent capacity to train local security forces and create a civilian arm to deal with other nations and groups.
Obama added Friday that NATO, under Rasmussen, was also looking for ways to deal with threats such as improvised explosives and cyber defenses, all at the service of the commitment that an attack on a NATO member is an attack on everyone.
Afghanistan will be at the forefront and center of Saturday's agenda, with NATO members working with others who have committed resources to the nation and its government to align our approach, according to Obama. He said that this includes the transition of Afghan forces from 2011 to 2014, taking over the security and governance mission in the country and forging a long-term partnership beyond that.
Russia's relationship with NATO and the United States is also a central issue on Saturday.
Obama said that from then on, NATO will work with Russia to build our cooperation with them in this area... recognizing that we share many of the same threats.
In an exclusive interview with Chris Lawrence of CNN, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili said he hoped that Russia's deeper association with NATO would make Moscow take a more civilized approach to dealing with its neighbors.
Russian troops have occupied Georgian territory since their invasion in 2008. Saakashvili, whose country has tried to join NATO has stalled for several years, said he hoped the alliance's involvement would push Russia to withdraw its troops from Georgia.
Once Russia becomes less paranoid, more cooperative, more self-confident in a more pleasant way -- because I think many things have emerged from its almost paranoid sense of insecurity -- hopefully Russia's small neighbors will feel safer, said Saakashvili, who met Obama on Friday.
Obama reiterated his belief that the U.S. Congress should approve the new START nuclear control treaty, which the U.S. and Russia agreed to last spring but which has not been ratified by the legislatures of any nation. Republicans in the U.S. Senate They have delayed a vote on START, citing a heavy workload, in the stupid session before a new Congress arrives next year, and concern for the strength of the US nuclear arsenal.
Obama said on Friday that NATO leaders had called for the approval of the treaty -- that, among other things, it would restart mutual nuclear inspections and limit the arsenal in the two countries -- critical to European and global security.
The failure to ratify—LSB—this treaty—RSB—will jeopardize the substantial progress that has been made in advancing our nuclear security and our partnership with Russia, Obama said.
The search for a new mandate for the entire alliance comes at a time when 16 of the 28 NATO members have announced cuts in defense spending. NATO officials said leaders are expected to agree at the summit on a list of the top 10 spending priorities, including helicopters, transfer aircraft, technology to combat improvised explosive devices, and increased medical capacity.
The outcome of the war in Afghanistan is intrinsically linked to the future of the NATO alliance, suggested a new analysis of the RAND Corporation. The report, released on Friday, warns that U.S. leadership in the war could undermine any future will to fight together if necessary.
In an alliance that finds consensus building is fundamental, having a clearly eclipsed partner all the others highlights the real limits of the transatlantic alliance, the report said.
The difficulty and duration of the engagement will weigh on the decisions of the alliance members to intervene or help in the future.
The scope of NATO's future functions abroad may be more limited, such as focusing on humanitarian assistance or on training, advice and assistance to nations seeking support. While these efforts may involve long-term commitments, they could not engage combat forces, RAND authors Andrew Hoehn and Sarah Harting wrote.
The new strategic concept will cite the current security challenges facing NATO members in the twenty-first century, such as terrorism, cyber war and piracy.
Rasmussen has encouraged NATO members to be more agile to respond to the threats of the twenty-first century and to continue investing in military technology despite the global economic recession. He urged allies to reduce fat, not military spending on muscle and pool.
The U.S. is pushing for a realignment of military spending priorities.
We have proposed and hope to have accepted a set of capabilities that the alliance, in a time of diminishing resources, will decide that it should finance, the United States. NATO Ambassador Ivo Daalder told reporters earlier this week. These are capabilities that deal with ongoing operations in Afghanistan, but also capabilities to address the threats of the twenty-first century, including strengthening our cyberdefences and adopting the deployment of missile defences to protect European territory and populations from the growing threat of ballistic missiles.
Obama will also hold a summit with European Union leaders, trying to reaffirm a partnership with Europe that many believe has drifted as the United States expands its partnerships in Asia. Employment and economic growth are expected to lead the agenda at a time of growing tension between the United States and European countries on the way to fixing the global economy.
While the U.S. has pressed to stimulate economic expansion with more public spending, many European allies are tightening their belts.
The future of some 80,000 US military forces in Europe will also be discussed. European leaders are looking for Obama to keep U.S. troops at their current levels, although the Obama administration has urged Europe to share more the burden of its own defense.

"Five exotic animals once owned by a man from Zanesville, Ohio, who released dozens of animals last year before committing suicide will be returned to the man's widow on Friday, the Ohio Department of Agriculture said.
Two spotted leopards, two macaque monkeys and a brown bear will be returned to Marian Thompson, widow of farmer Terry Thompson. In October he threw a big scare when he released 50 potentially dangerous animals from his farm before shooting himself.
Of the 50 animals Thompson released, 48 were killed by law enforcement, while two primates were killed by the other animals, zoo officials said.
Last fall in Ohio: Wild animals loose
The five animals that were returned to Marian Thompson were never released from their cages by her late husband. A sixth unreleased animal, a leopard, died in January at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, where all of Thompson's remaining animals had been housed for custody since the incident.
A state review committee concluded Monday that animals are free of dangerously infectious or contagious diseases. The finding required officials to lift a quarantine imposed on a movement in October to delay their return.
State officials said they were concerned that Marian Thompson said he would put the remaining five animals in the same cages that used to live on his Zanesville farm.
This raises concerns, as it has indicated that cages have not been repaired, and has repeatedly refused to allow animal welfare experts to assess whether conditions are safe for animals and sufficient to prevent them from escaping and endangering the community, said Erica Pitchford, spokesman for the Ohio Department of Agriculture.
State officials do not have the legal power to inspect cages before animals are returned, but they expect the local sheriff to seek a court order to inspect the farm to ensure the safety of animals and the public, Pitchford said.
Thompson had not allowed local police to enter the farm to check the pens, Muskingum County Sheriff Matthew Lutz told CNN Monday.
Thompson's lawyer did not immediately respond to a CNN call for comment.
Members are ready to deal with any problem with the animals returned, Lutz said.
“We have the zoo on fast dial,” Lutz said. If they push us to do what we had to do last time, we'd take care of it.
In April, the Ohio Senate passed legislation that would tighten rules for the private ownership of exotic animals and is now being heard in the House of Representatives. Zoo officials encourage legislators to quickly pass a bill to ensure public safety and protect animal welfare, the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium said in a press release.
Terry Thompson died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on October 18, shortly after opening cages and opening the fences of the farm that kept his menagerie private of lions, tigers, bears, wolves and monkeys.
The authorities, which had no access to tranquilizing weapons, killed two wolves, six black bears, two brown bears, nine male lions, eight female lions, three mountain lions and 18 Bengal tigers.
Thompson's property is about two miles from Zanesville, which is east of Columbus along Interstate 70. The 62-year-old boy had been released from a federal prison three weeks earlier after pleading guilty to possession of illegal firearms, including five fully automatic firearms.

"For centuries, Timbuktu has existed in the western imagination as a motto for the most exotic and far-conceivable place.
Located at the southern end of the Sahara, it acquired almost mythical status in distant countries because of its inaccessibility fable, and because of the tales of the dazzling material and intellectual wealth found there.
The intrigued visitors continue to be attracted by the treasures that survive the medieval golden age of the city as an important academic, religious and mercantile center - its great mud mosques, and hundreds of thousands of academic manuscripts in public and private collections.
The city, today part of present-day Mali and known as the city of 333 saints by the Sufi imams, sheikhs and scholars buried there, was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.
But there are fears that this carefully preserved legacy may be threatened by armed rebel groups that have invaded the old city this month, in a vacuum left by the retreating Malian government forces.
Irina Bokova, Director General of UNESCO, has called on groups to respect and protect the city's heritage. The extraordinary architectural wonders of Timbuktu land that are the great mosques of Djingareyber, Sankore and Sidi Yahia, must be safeguarded, he said.
Together with the 16 cemeteries and mausoleums of the site, they are essential for the preservation of the identity of the people of Mali and of our universal heritage.
Timbuktu, which has a population of about 50,000, is in the hands of at least two rival groups that have participated in a northern uprising against the Malian government, based in the southern capital of Bamako.
One is Ansar Dine, a Salafist Islamist group seeking to enforce Sharia law. The other, the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (LRB-MNLA-RRB), has been fighting for an independent homeland for the Tuareg nomadic people in the north of the country, and earlier this month unilaterally proclaimed independence for the region they call Azawad.
Following the overthrow of Libyan President Moammar Gaddafi, many Tuaregs who had been fighting for Gaddafi's forces would have returned to northern Mali, bringing their weapons with them. Last month, a Tuareg uprising triggered a military coup against Mali's president, Amadou Toumani Toure, by unsatisfied officials with the government's efforts to end the insurrection. But in the disorder that followed the coup, the rebels seized large areas of the north.
Martin van Vliet, a researcher at the Centre for African Studies in Leiden, the Netherlands, said that although Timbuktu was no longer a city of vital economic or military importance, it stood out as an important prize for the rebels because of its symbolic significance.
The group that controls Timbuktu controls the symbolic capital of the entire region, because it is so well known throughout the world. If you control that city, you'll know.
Historically, the legend of Timbuktu began to spread throughout the medieval world when the emperor of Mali made his pilgrimage to Mecca through Cairo in 1324, and dazzled those who encountered the gold his party carried.
In the early 16th century, reports of the city on the sand, then part of the Songhay Empire, leaked back to Europe through Moorish diplomat and writer Leo Africanus, adding to the almost mythical status of the city as African El Dorado.
Becoming the first European to reach the city later became an obsession for Western explorers, many of whom perished in the sands of the desert. In 1824, the Geographical Society of Paris even offered a reward for the first European to perform the feat.
Two years later, however, the person who did it found a disaster. Scottish explorer Gordon Laing survived an attack by Tuareg nomads on his way to Timbuktu, only to discover upon his arrival that his wealth had greatly diminished since his heyday. Laing stayed in town for a month, then was killed two days after leaving.
During its golden age, Timbuktu was a thriving desert trading city at the heart of major trade routes of gold and salt, and an important intellectual and spiritual center, which played a key role in the spread of Islam in Africa. Islamic scholars traveled great distances to study at the city university, which had 25,000 students during its zenith, and was composed of three mosques.
The mosques of Sankore, Sidi Yahia and Djingarei-ber, built from mud and wood bricks in the characteristic Sudanese-Sahelian architectural style, have been maintained and remain the main attractions of the city today. The latter, the oldest in Timbuktu, was built in the early 14th century, while the Sankore, during its heyday, is said to have the largest collection of books in Africa since the Alexandria Library of ancient times.
Timbuktu in the 14th to 16th centuries was an important university city where many manuscripts were produced referring to knowledge of astronomy, economics, religion, mathematics, physics and medicine, said Lazare Eloundou, head of the African unit of the UNESCO World Heritage Centre.
Understanding the other significant component of Timbuktu ' s heritage, this immense trove of academic manuscripts -- estimated at hundreds of thousands -- remains in the city in state and private collections.
For generations, local families have protected fragile manuscripts, some of which date back to the 13th century, from invaders. Fearing that those responsible for the current riots may plunder or destroy the treasures, librarians and curators are making efforts to hide the texts or remove them from the city safely. Although local library offices have been reported to have been looted by gunmen, significant loss of documents has not yet been reported, according to Eloundou.
We're still worried about what might happen in case there's a fight. “We are concerned about the risk of damage,” Eloundou said. Nor do we know what the reaction of Islamist groups will be with regard to manuscripts.
He said that the city's heritage was very important to the locals, as a source of cultural pride, but also of income. Even if the city's treasures survived unscathed, they lost because of the uprising as it could sink the region into isolation once again. In addition, it is estimated that 200,000 people have been displaced by the uprising in the region as a whole.
The fact that this part of the country has been taken over by the Tuareg rebellion and Islamist groups do not allow more tourists to visit, and communities depend heavily on tourist revenues, he said. This is really going to affect their lives.

"The theory of sets, as a separate mathematical discipline, begins in the work of Georg Cantor. One might say that the set theory was born in late 1873, when it made the amazing discovery that the linear continuum, that is, the real line, is not accounting, which means that its points cannot be counted using natural numbers. So, even though the set of natural numbers and the set of real numbers are both infinite, there are more real numbers than there are natural numbers, which opened the door to the investigation of the different sizes of infinity. See the post on the early development of set theory for a discussion of the origin of set-theoretic ideas and their use by different mathematicians and philosophers before and around Cantor's time.
According to Cantor, two sets A and B have the same size, or cardinality, if they are debatable, that is, the elements of A can be put in a one-to-one correspondence with the elements of B. Thus, the set N of natural numbers and the set R of real numbers have different cardinalities. In 1878 Cantor formulated the famous Continuum Hypothesis (CH), which states that each infinite set of real numbers is accounting, that is, it has the same cardinality as N, or it has the same cardinality as R. In other words, there are only two possible sizes of infinite sets of real numbers. CH is the most famous problem in set theory. Cantor himself devoted much effort to her, and so did many other leading mathematicians of the first half of the 20th century, such as Hilbert, who listed the CH as the first problem in his famous list of 23 unresolved mathematical problems presented in 1900 at the Second International Congress of Mathematicians, in Paris. Attempts to test the CH led to great discoveries in set theory, such as the theory of constructible sets, and the technique of forcing, which demonstrated that the CH cannot be tested or refuted from the usual axioms of set theory. To this day, the CH remains open.
At first, some inconsistencies, or paradoxes, arose from a naïve use of the notion of whole; in particular, from the deceptively natural assumption that each property determines a set, namely, the set of objects that have property. One example is Russell's paradox, also known as Zermelo:
consider ownership of sets if they are not members of themselves. If the property determines a set, call it A, then A is a member of itself if and only if A is not a member of itself.
Thus, some collections, such as the collection of all sets, the collection of all ordinal numbers, or the collection of all cardinal numbers, are not sets. Such collections are called appropriate classes.
To avoid paradoxes and put them on a firm basis, the established theory had to be axiomized. The first axiomization was due to Zermelo (1908) and came as a result of the need to explain the basic theoretical principles underlying his proof of Cantor's well-ordered Principle. Zermelo's axiomization avoids Russell's paradox by means of the separation axiom, which is formulated as quantification of set properties, and therefore is a second-order statement. The additional work of Skolem and Fraenkel led to the formalization of the separation axiom in terms of first-order formulas, rather than the informal notion of ownership, as well as the introduction of the replacement axiom, which is also formulated as an axiom scheme for first-order formulas (see section below). Replacement axiom is necessary for the proper development of the theory of ordinals and transfinite cardinals, using transfinite recursion (see Section 3). It is also necessary to prove the existence of such simple sets as the set of hereditary finite sets, that is, those finite sets whose elements are finite, whose elements are also finite, etc. ; or to prove basic theoretical facts such as that each set is contained in a transitive set, that is, a set containing all the elements of its elements (see Mathias 2001 for the weaknesses of the Zermelo set theory). An additional addition, by von Neumann, of the Foundation's axiom, led to the standard set theory axiom system, known as the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms plus the Axiom of Choice, or ZFC.
Other axiomatizations of set theory, such as those of von Neumann-Bernays-Gödel (NBG), or Morse-Kelley (MK), also allow a formal treatment of appropriate classes.",C2
"It was after the robotic hummingbird flew around the auditorium -- and after a speaker talked about the hypersonic plane that could fly from New York to the West Coast in 11 minutes -- that things got really nervous.
Vijay Kumar, an engineering professor at the University of Pennsylvania, showed the more than 1,300 attendees at last week's TED conference several videos in which fleets of small flying robots carried out a series of intricate manufacturing, working together on tasks without colliding or interfering with the flight capabilities of others.
It seemed that, at least for some in the audience, a bridge had been crossed into a new era of technology, one that could change the way we think about robots and their application to fields such as construction, shipping and emergency response.
Kumar's devices - LRB - call them Autonomous Agile Air Robots -RRB- cooperated in the construction of simple structures and demonstrated that they were able to enter a building for the first time and quickly build a map that would allow evaluating and responding to a structural collapse or fire.
He held a robot, designed by his students Daniel Mellinger and Alex Kushleyev, which weighs just over a tenth of a pound and is about 8 inches in diameter. The device has four rotors; when they rotate at the same speed, the robot floats. If you increase the speed, Kumar explained, the robot flies up. Rotating a rotor faster than the opposite causes the robot to tilt. You can also turn around several times without losing your ability to fly and you can regain your stability when you launch into the air.
Robots are able to learn trajectories and manipulations that can literally allow them to fly through rings -- and other confined spaces.
When robots form in a flotilla, they calculate -LRB- a hundred times per second -RRB- and maintain a safe distance between them. He showed a video of 20 robots flying in a variety of formations -- and moving through obstacles -- inches from each other without interfering with the stability of their neighbors.
To finish his presentation, he showed a video, created by his students in three days, of nine flying robots playing the theme of James Bond in musical instruments.
TED began in the 1980s with the intention of focusing on technology, entertainment, and design, and its lectures are usually depleted, attracting a high-achievement audience willing to pay $7,500 to attend. TED, a non-profit organization, makes many of the conversations freely available on your site. -LRB-CNN has an association with TED in which it regularly publishes some TED talks -RRB-.
TED aims to offer state-of-the-art technology at its conferences, and this year's event, labeled Full Spectrum, was no exception. However, the difficult balance between technology and the social problems it generates seemed more prominent than ever when speakers came on the stage to give their talks -LRB- and be filmed by eight HD cameras for possible web viewing -RRB-.
In Tuesday's first session, there was a sharp contrast between the unlimited optimism that a technological solution could be found for each of Earth's problems and a vision of a planet that was headed for destruction because of humanity's inability to control its inventions and its consumption.
Paul Gilding, former head of Greenpeace, stated that the Earth is full, full of us, full of our things, full of our waste and full of our demands, and warned of a severe and potentially violent interruption in the future, as the calculation comes for a planet that lives beyond its means. The idea that the planet can sustain 9 billion people without making disturbing changes is wrong, he said.
Peter Diamandis, founder of the X Prize, responded with a catalogue of the ways in which technology has radically improved our lives -- it has lengthened human life, conquered many deadly diseases, expanded economic opportunities and made possible a global network of communication, already connecting 2 billion people, with 3 billion more on the way to logging in this decade.
Technology is a liberating force of resources, he said, maintaining that a planet bathed in solar energy and covered with water does not lack the ingredients for a productive life.
However, for every technological evangelist, there was a warning note sounded by other speakers.
NASA scientist James Hansen, one of the leading global climate change alert voices due to carbon emissions, presented an urgent case to take action to address the effects of economic activity before ice caps melt and cities flood with dramatic sea-level increases.
But a professor at MIT, Donald Sadoway, offered reasons to hope that the use of carbon-free solar and wind energy could become much more widespread through a new battery technology that he and his students are developing to store energy for use at a time when the wind stops and the sun sets. Sadoway, whose work has attracted an investment from Bill Gates, said the successful use of his liquid metal battery could reduce the need for new power plants burning fossil fuels.
Regina Dugan, who demonstrated robotic hummingbird and runs the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, spoke of research on a prosthetic arm controlled by single thoughts, robust cars built with lighter metals than polystyrene foam and a robot that can function as a cheetah.
TED.com: Susan Cain in the Power of Introverts
And yet technology did not seem to have a solution to the problems highlighted by Bryan Stevenson, director of the Equal Justice Initiative. He spoke of the increase in the number of Americans imprisoned from 300,000 40 years ago to 2.3 million today, the large number of Black Americans who have been permanently deprived of their voting capacity due to persecution for low-level drug crimes and the question he said is raised by the death penalty -- not if criminals deserve to die, but if America as a society deserves to kill.
Stevenson's talk provoked a standing ovation -- and the next day, after TED curator Chris Anderson appealed for funds, Anderson said that $1.12 million had been raised for Stevenson's nonprofit organization on the spot.
For a long time digital technology enthusiast, MIT professor Sherry Turkle spoke of being on the cover of Wired magazine when his book Life on the Screen was published in the 1990s. In his new, darker book, Alone Together, he writes about daily family and social relationships put at risk by the compulsion to constantly interact with mobile devices as a substitute for face-to-face interaction.
People write during board meetings, buy and text during class, and even text during funerals, he said. Technology gives us the illusion of being constantly in contact with people, yet we evade the real demands of friendship. And Turkle noted that Japanese researchers are developing robots to provide care to the elderly and children.
As to emphasize his point, a day after his talk, the Danish scientist Henrik Scharfe demo'ed Geminoid-DK, a surprisingly realistic robot version of himself. Although their movement and speech are limited, robot technology is likely to evolve rapidly.
And so it seemed like it wasn't just a joke that Scharfe said, ""In ten years, I'll be home having a beer in Denmark and the robot will come to TED for a chat.
Scharfe said after his talk that he recognized the dangers Turkle was talking about, but thought the robot's development was worth it.
This can never be about replacing the human being, he said in his talk, but about using technology to understand the whole spectrum of human being.

"According to Hartmann, impartial philosophical research moves through the three main stages of phenomenological, aporetical and theoretical development. The first stage is descriptive and requires the systematic collection of all available evidence relevant to what is under consideration. Most of the time, descriptions end in conflicting thesis, often in the form of aporias. More than anyone else, Hartmann rehabilitates the value of aporias (for two recent evaluations of Hartmann's aporetic method see Schlittmaier 2011 and Rescher 2011). The Apostries themselves are informative and should not be forced to disappear by fiat decisions, such as an a priori assumption about the general consistency of reality or the assumption that we have direct and transparent access to reality. The last phase of the philosophical method consists of using as few metaphysical assumptions as possible for the systematic coordination of the results of the first two phases (E, S).
Metaphysical assumptions are necessary for the task of incorporating aporias into a framework capable of making sense of them. Since metaphysical assumptions are not directly supported by descriptive data, it is advisable to keep them to a minimum, or to assume the weakest metaphysical assumptions possible.
An original way to distinguish between ontology and metaphysics underlies the third stage of theoretical development. Ontology, for Hartmann, refers to what may be subsumed into at least partially representative categories (see section 3 below). Two main consequences derive from this view of ontology: firstly, ontology is primarily a category theory, in the sense that all ontological distinctions have the form of categories (A.Intro1), and secondly, science in all its branches is the most successful and powerful ally of ontology. More precisely, for Hartmann, science is ontological in all its ramifications (G.37a). This rather disagrees with the general view of science as an eminently epistemological matter. This is one of the themes on which Hartmann is firmly departing from the Kantian legacy, to be precise, the neokantian. The assertion that the main orientation of science is ontological immediately implies that scientific categories are other specifications and subdivisions of ontological categories. In other words, contact with science is a characteristic feature of category theory, and therefore of ontology (A.Intro1). The philosopher's task is to develop the first and most general articulations of category theory, while scientists deal with their later specifications.",C2
"Socialism is best defined in contrast to capitalism, since socialism has emerged as much as a critical challenge to capitalism, as a proposal to overcome and replace it. In the classical Marxist definition (G.A. Cohen 2000a: chap. 3; Fraser 2014: 57-9), capitalism implies certain relations of production. These include certain forms of control over the productive forces—the labor force that workers deploy in production and means of production such as natural resources, tools and spaces they use to produce goods and services—and certain social patterns of economic interaction that typically correlate with that control. Capitalism shows the following constitutive characteristics:
(i) Most of the means of production are privately owned and controlled.
(ii) Persons legally possess their labour force. (Here capitalism differs from slavery and feudalism, under which systems some individuals have the right to control, either wholly or partially, the labor power of others).
(iii) Markets are the main mechanism for allocating inputs and outputs from production and determining how companies ' productive surplus is used, in particular whether or not it is consumed or invested.
An additional feature that is typically present where i)–(iii) is maintained is that:
(iv) There is a class division between capitalists and workers, which implies specific relations (e.g., negotiation, conflict or subordination) between these classes, and the configuration of the labour market, the enterprise and the broader political process.
The existence of wage labor is often seen by socialists as a necessary condition for a society to be counted as capitalist (Schweickart 2002 [2011: 23]). Typically, workers (as opposed to capitalists) must sell their workforce to earn a living. They sell it to the capitalists, who (as opposed to the workers) control the means of production. The capitalists tend to subordinate the workers in the production process, since the capitalists have an asymmetrical decision-making power over what is produced and how it is produced. Capitalists also own production and sell it on the market, and control most of the investment flow within the economy. The relationship between capitalists and workers may involve cooperation, but also conflict relations (e.g. with regard to wages and working conditions). This more or less antagonistic power relationship between capitalists and workers develops in a number of areas, within production itself and in the broader political process, since in the economic and political domains decisions are made about who does what and who gets what.
There are possible economic systems that would present exceptions, in which (iv) is not maintained although (i), (ii) and (iii) all are obtained. Examples of this are a society of independent producers of commodities or a democracy of ownership (in which individuals or groups of workers own enterprises). However, there is a debate about what is feasible—accessible and stable—that is in a modern economic environment (O’Neill 2012).
Another characteristic that is also typically seen as the emergence where (i)-(iii) hold is this:
(v) Production is mainly oriented towards capital accumulation (i.e. economic production is mainly profit oriented rather than human needs). (G.A. Cohen 2000a; Roemer 2017).
In contrast to capitalism, socialism can be defined as a type of society in which, at least, (i) it becomes (i*):
(i) Most of the means of production are under social and democratic control.
Changes with respect to characteristics (ii), (iii) and (v) are heatedly debated among socialists. As for (ii), socialists hold the view that workers must control their labour power, but many do not assert the type of absolute rights of libertarian property in the labour power that would, for example, prevent taxes or other forms of compulsory contribution to meet the basic needs of others (G.A. Cohen 1995). As for (iii), there is a recent flourishing literature on ""market socialism"", which we discussed below, where proposals are put forward to create a socialist economy but which, however, has extensive markets. Finally, with regard to v), although most socialists agree that, due to competitive pressures, capitalists are obliged to seek the maximization of profits, some are puzzled if when they do this, it is ""thank you and fear"" and not the generation of resources to make others, in addition to them, better placed, which is the dominant, most basic impulse and, therefore, the degree to which the maximization of profits must be considered a problematic phenomenon normatively. (See Steiner 2014, in contrast to G.A. Cohen 2009, discussing the case of capitalists accumulating capital to give it away through charity.) In addition, some socialists argue that the pursuit of profit in a socialist market economy is not inherently suspicious (Schweickart 2002 [2011]). Most socialists, however, tend to find the motive for problematic gain.
An important point about this definition of socialism is that socialism is not equivalent to statism, and it could be said to be in conflict with it. (i*) involves the expansion of social power, power based on the ability to mobilize voluntary cooperation and collective action, unlike state power, power based on the control of the creation of rules and the imposition of rules on a territory, as well as economic power, power based on the control of material resources (Wright 2010). If a state controls the economy but in turn is not democratically controlled by the individuals involved in economic life, what we have is some form of statism, not socialism (see also Arnold n.d. in Other Internet Resources (OIR); Dardot & Laval 2014).

"When Chris Christie praises President Barack Obama as outstanding and incredibly supportive, you know something extraordinary has happened.
Obama updated on Sandy; praised by Christie
In this case, it was once in a lifetime superstorm Sandy, which caused the Frankish Republican governor of New Jersey to declare a state of emergency and seek federal help for widespread devastation.
Interviewed on Tuesday at NBC, Christie described Obama's response as outstanding, and told CNN that the president had been incredibly understanding and helpful to our state.
This is much more important than any election, Christie told Piers Morgan of CNN tonight.
Obama has been exceptional in dealing with this and I hope to see him tomorrow so he can see for himself what this hurricane has done to my state, Christie said Tuesday night.
Such effusive praise from a frequent critic of Obama and a strong supporter of Republican presidential challenger Mitt Romney put the campaign magnifying glass on a key electoral issue -- the role of the federal government -- a week before the November 6 vote.
Photos: Superstorm sequels Sandy
He also focused attention on how Romney would handle such a disaster if he were to defeat Obama in what is expected to be a very close election.
On Tuesday, the Republican Party candidate showed little inclination to address the issue. At a campaign event, Romney switched to a storm relief effort in Ohio, ignoring reporters' questions about whether he supported the role of the Federal Emergency Management Agency in disaster relief.
Instead, he focused his comments on supporters who donated relief supplies to storm victims in ways that contribute to meeting the overall need.
“We can’t solve all the problems with our effort this morning,” Romney said, adding one of the things you learn in life is that you make the difference you can, and you can’t always solve all the problems yourself.
Romney in the aftermath of the storm: People are suffering '
Romney's Democratic critics and his fellow formula -- the conservative House Budget President, Paul Ryan of Wisconsin -- argue their proposals to cut government spending and provide extensive tax cuts without generating more government revenue will end up damaging the economy and increasing the federal deficit.
Photos: New York recovers from Sandy
In particular, Obama's campaign challenges Romney's claim that increasing economic growth from tax cuts combined with shifting current federal responsibilities to states, the private sector, and humanitarian and charitable agencies can balance the budget.
Last year, Romney argued in a Republican presidential debate in New Hampshire that cutting federal spending should be based on prioritizing what is absolutely necessary and eliminating the rest.
Asked by CNN moderator John King if disaster relief efforts should be delivered to states, Romney said that every time you get a chance to take something from the federal government and send it back to states, that's the right direction. And if you can go even further and send it back to the private sector, that's even better.
Instead of thinking about the federal budget, which we should cut, we should ask ourselves the opposite. What should we keep? Romney added. We should take everything we're doing at the federal level and say, what are the things we're doing that we don't have to do? And those things we have to stop doing, because we're borrowing $1.6 billion more this year than we're getting.
King approached to ask if Romney specifically referred to disaster relief, a topic on the news at the time following a deadly Joplin, Missouri, tornado, and Romney continued: We cannot afford to do those things without endangering the future of our children. It is simply immoral, in my opinion, that we continue to accumulate increasing debts and pass them on to our children, knowing very well that we will all be dead and missing before it is paid. It doesn't make any sense.
Romney: States must manage emergency management
With Hurricane Sandy then on the East Coast on Monday, Romney's comments on the debate 16 months earlier became a topic of political discussion, and Romney's campaign issued a statement in response.
Sandy reminds us of climate change and other neglected issues of the campaign
Governor. Romney believes that states should be in charge of emergency management in response to storms and other natural disasters in their jurisdictions, spokesman Amanda Henneberg said. As the first responders, States are in the best position to help affected individuals and communities, and to direct resources and assistance to where they are most needed. This includes assistance from the federal government and FEMA.
Henneberg added another sentence to Tuesday's statement, saying that a Romney-Ryan administration will always ensure that disaster financing is there for those who need it. Period.
Craig Fugate, administrator of the emergency management agency, told reporters Tuesday that the agency had $3.6 billion left in its disaster relief fund. The agency works with state and local authorities, as well as with the American Red Cross and other agencies to help disaster victims rent temporary housing, repair their homes, obtain loans to cover the losses of small businesses and farms, as well as help clean up storm debris, including hazardous materials.
Vice President Joe Biden, meanwhile, said Tuesday that the federal response to Sandy was working as supposed, and highlighted reporters in Ohio what he described as unprecedented cooperation between municipal, state, and federal authorities and agencies.
A White House statement also emphasized such cooperation, noting that Obama spoke over the phone with a number of Republican and Democratic governors and mayors of storm-affected states.
Impact of Sandy: State by State
Romney has made political dysfunction in Washington a target of his campaign, blaming Obama for what he calls failed leadership in being unable to forge a deficit reduction agreement with Republicans.
Democrats blame Republicans for what they claim they are unwilling to compromise, and Obama and Biden's focus on cooperation seemed to be aimed in part at demonstrating the administration's ability to do things.
The question of the size and scope of the federal government is at the heart of both campaigns.
Obama and Democrats argue that rights programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are vital to the social contract to provide taxpayers with basic needs, and that the government also has a role to play in education and technological development while providing services such as national defense and disaster relief.
Republicans, driven by the party's conservative wing, call for immediate steps to clear the chronic budget deficits and growing federal debt that they say threaten national security and stability. They want to reduce the size of the government and reduce taxes while reforming rights through partial privatization, reducing and delaying some benefits and other measures.
Sensitive issues such as disaster relief generally benefit the Democrats and their support for the government's benefits, especially in times of crisis when the images of victims who suffer dominate the waves.
Superstorm Sandy breaks records
Obama has avoided any direct political conversation in the last few days when the huge storm approached the east coast, cancelling the campaign events and focusing his attention on the administration's response. In statements on Monday and Tuesday about the storm and its aftermath, he stressed the need for a collective response and at the same time made sure to point out the federal role in relief efforts.
We have been able to get more than 1,000 FEMA officers instead, pre-positioned, said the president. We've been able to get supplies, food, medicine, water, emergency generators, to ensure that hospitals and law enforcement offices are able to stay operational while they're out there responding.
It also sounded like a main theme of the campaign by assuring those hit hardest by the storm that their administration and the entire nation were with them.
This is a difficult time for millions of people along the east coast, but the U.S. is tougher and we are tougher because we unite, leave no one behind, make sure we respond as a nation, Obama said.
Obama visits the Red Cross: Storm is not over yet
About the same time he spoke, the White House announced that Obama will travel to New Jersey on Wednesday, where he will join the government. Christie seeing the damage of the storm, talking to citizens recovering from the storm and thanking the first responders who put their lives at risk to protect their communities.
While the president and one of Romney's main supporters will be photographed together in response to the disaster, Romney is scheduled to be in Florida for three campaign events.

"Young Cubans are coming to use the first open and free Internet service known in the communist island nation, which has been made possible thanks to one of the most famous artists in Cuba. A modest cultural center in the capital, Havana, has suddenly become a rare source of free Wi-Fi. The renowned Cuban artist Kcho is providing the service. Perhaps more surprising, its spokesman said that the measure had been approved by the state telecommunications company, Etecsa.
The service is reported to be very slow, especially when the center is crowded. However, in a country where it is estimated that only 5 per cent of the population has unrestricted access to the Internet, a facility that is free and free of restrictions is being hailed as an unprecedented blessing.
The opportunity to click on international news websites, communicate with friends and family abroad and use sites like Facebook and Twitter has created a great buzz. “I come as many times as I can,” said 20-year-old Adonis Ortiz, while chatting on video with his father, who lives in the United States and hasn’t seen him in nine years.
The gradual loosening of the prolonged diplomatic and commercial freeze between the United States and Cuba is expected to bring US technological giants like Google and Apple to the Cuban market as soon as they are allowed. Meanwhile, Cuba has installed a high-speed fiber optic cable under the sea from Venezuela and Internet users have access to Chinese equipment.
Another estimate, that one quarter of Cubans have access to the Internet – still one of the lowest penetration rates in the Western Hemisphere – actually measures residents who use a restricted domestic intranet with only certain websites and limited email.
Kcho has offered public admission to his own personal Internet connection. But instead of this being the counter-revolutionary, or post-revolutionary, movement of a free-market rebel, Kcho may have been selected as the acceptable face of a regime that consents to the inevitable attraction of the Internet.
Kcho, who has close ties with the Cuban government, announced that his actions had been approved by the Ministry of Culture. The artist said he wanted to encourage Cubans to become familiar with the Internet. “It is only possible through the will to do so and absorb costs,” Kcho told Associated Press. “It’s expensive, but the profit is tremendous. I have something that's big and powerful. I can share it and I’m doing it.”
Kcho's real name is Alexis Leiva Machado.
He won international fame for his painting, sculpture and drawings after winning the grand prize at a major art biennial in South Korea. It is currently preparing for the Havana Biennial in May. Born in one of the outer islands of Cuba, he is known for contemporary art with rustic, coastal and patriotic themes and images.
In the downtown courtyard, technology experts millennials stay all day long in wicker chairs under a white canopy or just outside when it is full, banging on laptops and tablets or glued to their smartphones.
Cuba has some of the lowest connectivity rates on the planet, with restricted dialing and almost unknown broadband accounts at home, except in the case of foreigners who pay hundreds of dollars a month for service in a country where the average salary is between 17 and 20 dollars a month. It is estimated that Kcho is paying $900 a month to provide free Wi-Fi.
Since 2013, Cuban authorities have opened hundreds of internet rooms, where an hour online costs $4.50, at speeds far below those of Kcho's studio of about 2mbps. A 2014 report from Akamai Technologies found that average Internet connectivity speeds are around 10.5 mbps in the US. and 23.6 mbps in South Korea's world leader. Globally, the average was approximately 3.9mbps.
With dozens of users at a given time, the strength of Kcho's wi-fi signal is diluted. One user said that sometimes it happens in the middle of the night, when there's no one else around, and finds that it's incredibly fast.

"The mayor of the city of Kharkiv, in eastern Ukraine, was subjected to emergency surgery after being shot in the back, city officials and police said Monday, in the midst of continuing riots in the region.
The attack on Mayor Gennady Kernes occurred around noon local time, the official Kharkiv office website said. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the shooting.
After a two-hour operation, Kernes was out of surgery, but in critical condition, the city office said.
The surgery was successful. His life-threatening condition is expected to continue for several days, a statement said. He was unconscious when he was taken to the hospital.
The online statement also said that a bullet casing was found at the scene.
Police said an investigation unit was trying to determine the circumstances of the shooting.
In a great challenge for the new Kiev leaders, armed rebels have captured cities and government buildings throughout eastern Ukraine and have a team of European supervisors as hostages.
Western nations accuse Moscow of supporting separatist gunmen who are occupying official buildings in cities across the region.
Penalties
On Monday the U.S. imposed sanctions on seven Russian government officials and 17 companies linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin in his latest action to punish Moscow for its actions in Ukraine.
The White House said the seven Russians, including two from Putin's inner circle, are now subject to a freeze on their assets in the United States and a travel ban to the United States.
In addition, the United States will refuse applications for export licences for high-tech items that could contribute to Russia's military capabilities. The Department of Commerce and the State Department will revoke any existing export license that meets these conditions, the White House said in a statement.
Sanctions are based on those already in force. We are moving forward with an expanded list of people, U.S. President Barack Obama told journalists in Manila, Philippines.
The move, Obama said, was to encourage Putin to walk, not just to talk about resolving the crisis in Ukraine.
If the last round of sanctions doesn't work, the next phase could target economic sectors like banking, Obama said.
The European Union also announced on Monday that it was imposing sanctions on 15 people who are responsible for actions that undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. A list of the people targeted by the latest sanctions will be published on Tuesday and will enter into force at the same time, the Council of the European Union said. The sanctions will include the assets freeze and travel ban.
Defense Secretaries of the United States and Russia Speak
Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel spoke on the phone with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu on Monday.
According to a Pentagon description of his conversation, Shoigu reiterated his assurance that Russian forces would not invade Ukraine. Hagel, Pengaton said, called for an end to what he described as Russia's destabilizing influence within Ukraine and warned that continued aggression would further isolate Russia and lead to more diplomatic and economic pressure.
The description of the call by the Russian government said that Shoigu definitively denied the unfounded allegations of the presence of Russian military intelligence and sabotage groups on Ukrainian territory and criticized what he called anti-Russian hysteria recently unleashed in the Western press.
He also criticized what he said as an unprecedented increase in the activity of U.S. and NATO troops in Eastern Europe near the Russian border, as described by the Russian government's call.
Ukrainian soldier dead
A homemade bomb exploded near Ukrainian soldiers in the eastern Donetsk region on Monday, killing one and wounding another, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence said.
The death occurred days after Ukrainian forces said they killed five pro-Russian militants in an operation to clear the barricades near the city of Slavyansk last week. The police are investigating Monday's explosion, the Ministry of Defense said.
A CNN team covering a pro-Ukraine rally in Donetsk saw violence unfolding on Monday when pro-Russian separatists wielded batons beating protesters who said they wanted to see a united Ukraine.
Observer released
Pro-Russian separatists who maintained a team of European military observers in eastern Ukraine released one of the observers for medical reasons on Sunday, shortly after marching them to the cameras.
At least seven of the inspectors of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe appeared at a press conference organized by Vyacheslav Ponomarev, the self-declared mayor of Slavyansk, who referred to them as prisoners of war.
The released observer was from Sweden and had been suffering from diabetes, Ponomarev spokesperson Stella Khorosheva told CNN. Michael Bociurkiw, OSCE spokesman in Kiev, described it as a positive development.
The monitors were captured Friday outside Slavyansk, one of the points of conflict in the confrontation between the interim government of Ukraine and the pro-Russian factions defying their authority in the east. They said that although they have diplomatic status, they joined the Sunday press conference because the mayor asked them to.
Germany strongly criticized the group's appearance in the media.
The parade of OSCE observers and Ukrainian security forces as prisoners is abhorrent and a flagrant violation of their human dignity, Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said in a statement.
He added that Russia had a duty to influence the separatists so that the other members of the mission could be released as soon as possible.
Putin has repeatedly criticized what he says is the use of force by Kiev against Ukrainian civilians.

"Glastonbury Festival is fighting the scourge of the plastic water bottle as part of a long-term strategy to become the most ecological outdoor music event in the world.
The festival organizers are aiming at the disposable bottle, one of the most striking symbols of shooting culture, which every year leaves the 900-acre Somerset site crowned in plastic, with an estimated million plastic bottles used during the festival.
Reusable stainless steel bottles will be delivered to 2,000 members of the road team and the band, with thousands more for sale to festival visitors, to stop relying on plastic bottles. The 140,000 entry holders are also urged to carry reusable bottles that can fill 400 taps of potable water splashed all over the site.
Lucy Smith, Glastonbury’s green theme organizer, said: “We have incredible water quality in the UK, but everyone is obsessed with drinking bottled water.”
He said the initiative precedes a plan for Glastonbury 2015 to replace all plastic beer glasses and covered with reusable items in an attempt to eradicate the legacy of plastic waste from the huge rural area.
Environmentalists estimate that 150 million tons of plastic waste currently pollute the planet and oceans, poisoning ecosystems and killing wildlife.
Ultimately, the festival organizers hope to make Glastonbury the world’s greenest festival, emulating the American’s Burning Man festival in the Black Rock Desert of Nevada, which is a “no trace” event, where people have to take everything they bring.
Glastonbury resellers are also being urged to travel to the site by public transport or try to share the car with friends. “We want to be as sustainable as we can. We do everything we can, but facing the litter of 140,000 people is a challenge. We can’t put containers everywhere,” Smith added.
Activists say plastic water bottles can take hundreds or even thousands of years to fully biodegrade, with their manufacturing exacerbating their negative ecological impact. Millions of barrels of oil are used in the manufacture of plastic bottles and the transportation of mineral water across the planet produces even more carbon emissions.
In general, it is estimated that 13 billion plastic water bottles are sold annually in the United Kingdom, but only one in five is said to be recycled.
Smith said that, instead of buying bottled water, festival attendees should take advantage of the water in the tap, which is being pulled out of huge underground reservoirs, instead of outdated water tanks providing heavily chlorinated drinking water. The charity WaterAid will also install water kiosks around the site, supplying reusable bottles and cups and offering free refills. In 2015, kiosks, based on those found in Africa, will double as DJ booths at night.

"Although it is occasionally suggested that a concern for self-awareness is a peculiarly modern phenomenon, originating in Descartes (Brinkmann 2005), it is in fact the subject of lively ancient and medieval debates, many of which prefigure early modern and contemporary concerns (Sorabji 2006). Aristotle, for example, affirms that a person must, in perceiving anything, also perceive his own existence (De Sensu 7.448a), a suggestive affirmation of the opinion that consciousness implies self-consciousness. Moreover, according to Aristotle, since the intellect takes the form of what is thought (Kahn 1992), it is “thinkable as are the objects of thought” (De Anima 3.4.430), a statement that was interpreted by Aristotle’s medieval commentators as the view that self-consciousness depends on an awareness of extra-mental things (Cory 2014: chap. 1; Owens 1988).
On the contrary, Platonic tradition, mainly through Augustine's influence, writing in the fourth and fifth centuries, is associated with the vision that the mind ""gains self-knowledge"" (On the Trinity 9.3; Matthew 1992; Cary 2000) by being present to itself. Therefore, in this view, self-consciousness does not require awareness of external things. In a similar line, in the 11th century, Avicena argues, through her experiment of the thought of the Flying Man, that a newly created person floating in a void, with all the senses disabled, would nevertheless be aware of himself. Thus, the self that one knows cannot be a bodily thing of which one is conscious through the senses (Kaukua & Kukkonen 2007; Black 2008; Kaukua 2015). In such views, and in contrast to the Aristotelian picture, basic self-consciousness is neither sensory in nature nor dependent on the consciousness of other things. This last statement was accepted by Aquinas, written in the 13th century, which can be seen as synthesizing aspects of Platonic and Aristotelian traditions (Cory 2014). Because not only does Aquinas affirm that there is a form of self-consciousness—consciousness that exists—for which “the mere presence of the mind suffices,” there is another form—consciousness of one’s essence—that, as Aristotle had affirmed, depends on knowing other things and therefore “the mere presence of the mind is not sufficient” (Summa 1, 87, 1; Kenny 1993: chap. 10).
This ancient and medieval debate about whether the mere presence of the mind is sufficient for self-consciousness is related to another about whether self-consciousness is in itself of a sensory character or, in other words, whether the self is perceptible or not. Aquino has sometimes been interpreted as a positive answer to this question, sometimes a negative answer (see Pasnau 2002: ch. 11, and Cory 2014: ch. 4, for divergent opinions). These topics were also discussed in several Indian debates (hindu, Jain and Buddhists) (Albahari 2006; Siderits, Thompson, & Zahavi 2013; Ganeri 2012a,b), with a variety of perspectives represented. For example, in the writing of the 11th-century writer Jain Prabhācandra, there appears an argument very similar to the argument of the Flying Man of Avicena for the possibility of self-consciousness without body consciousness (Ganeri 2012a: ch. 2), while several thinkers at the Advaita Vendānta school argue that there is no self-consciousness without incarnation (Ram-Prasad 2013). There were, therefore, extensive debates in the ancient and medieval period not only about the nature of self-consciousness, but also about its relationship with other aspects of the mind, especially sensory perception and body consciousness.",C2
"Halloween (also known as the eve of all holes) is a party that is celebrated in the United States on October 31 of each year, regardless of the day of the week on which this date falls. Although rooted in religion, Halloween today is mainly enjoyed by its decorations, costumes, sweets, treats, and general emotion, and is also enjoyed by most of them.
Before Halloween, many individuals carve a design in an orange pumpkin, or a solid and durable vegetable. Once a personally satisfying design is carved, a lit candle is usually placed inside a pumpkin, so it is a Jack-O-Lantern. At night, this design lights up against the darkness.
In addition to carving pumpkins, some celebrate Halloween by putting decorations. Supernatural figures (referred in this case to unnatural creatures typically based on fiction), including vampires, ghosts, werewolves, zombies, and more, generally represent most of these decorations. Bugs, spiders, cobwebs, tombstones, and anything else that can be considered creepy (or unusual and possibly terrifying) can also be found on Halloween, in the form of decoration.
Only some adults celebrate Halloween, and usually do so by attending parties. Conversely, the vast majority of children dress in suits (Halloween costumes can be based on anything, from the above-mentioned supernatural creatures to the stars of today's movies) and walk door-to-door in search of candy, a practice known as trick or candy, on Halloween. After knocking on a door (houses participating in Halloween usually leave a light on), one says, ""Trick or Deal"" and one piece (or pieces!) candy is given to him or her.",C2
"According to a new scientific study, temperature increases resulting from uncontrolled climate change will be at the most severe of those projected. The leading research scientist said that unless greenhouse gas emissions were cut, the planet would heat at least 4C to 2100, twice the level that governments around the world consider dangerous. Research indicates that fewer clouds form as the planet heats up, meaning that less sunlight is reflected in space, further increasing temperatures. The way clouds affect global warming has been the biggest mystery surrounding future climate change. Professor Steven Sherwood of the University of New South Wales in Australia, who led the new paper, said: “This study opens new paths twice: first, identifying what is controlling changes in the cloud and, second, strongly discounting the lower estimates of future global warming in favor of the highest and most harmful estimates.”
“The 4C would probably be catastrophic rather than simply dangerous,” Sherwood said. “For example, it would make life in much of the tropics difficult, if not impossible, and would ensure the eventual melting of the Greenland ice sheet and part of the Antarctic ice sheet,” with a sea level rise of many metres as a result.
Research is a “great advance” that halves uncertainty about how much warming is caused by increased carbon emissions, according to scientists who commented on the study, published in Nature magazine. Hideo Shiogama and Tomoo Ogura of the National Institute of Environmental Studies of Japan said that the explanation of how fewer clouds form as the world warms up was “convenient” and agreed that this indicated that future climate change would be greater than expected. But they said there were more challenges ahead to further reduce future temperature projections.
Scientists measure the sensitivity of the Earth's climate to greenhouse gases by estimating the increase in temperature that would be caused by a doubling of CO in the atmosphere compared to pre-industrial levels, as is likely to occur within 50 years, according to current trends. For two decades, these estimates have ranged between 1.5C and 5C: a wide range. The new investigation reduced that range to between 3C and 5C, examining closely the greatest cause of uncertainty: clouds.
The key was to ensure that the way clouds are formed in the real world was accurately represented in computer climate models, which are the only tool researchers have for predicting future temperatures. When water evaporates from the oceans, steam can rise more than nine miles to form rain clouds that reflect sunlight; or, it can rise only a few kilometers and drift back without forming clouds. In fact, both processes occur and climate models covering this complexity predicted future temperatures significantly higher than those that only include nine-mile-high clouds.
“Climate skeptics like to criticize climate models for being wrong and we’re the first to admit they’re not perfect,” Sherwood said. “But what we’re finding is that mistakes are being made by models that predict less warming, not by those who predict more.” He added: “Sceptics can also point to the ‘hiato’ of temperatures since the end of the 20th century, but there is increasing evidence that this inapplicably called hiato is not seen in other measures of the climate system and is almost temporary safe.”
The global average air temperature has increased relatively slowly from a high point in 1998 caused by the El Niño oceanic phenomenon, but observations show that heat is still trapped in increasing amounts by greenhouse gases, with more than 90 per cent disappearing in the oceans.
In addition, a study conducted in November 2013 suggested that “pause” could largely be an illusion resulting from the lack of temperature readings of polar regions, where warming is higher. Sherwood accepts the work of his team on the role of clouds cannot definitively rule out that future temperature increases are at the lower end of projections. “But,” he said, for that to be the case, “a new dimension would need to be invoked to the problem involving an important missing ingredient for which we currently have no evidence. Such a thing is not out of the question, but requires a lot of faith.” He added: “The increase in the global average temperature from at least 4C to 2100 will have a profound impact on the world and the economies of many countries if we do not urgently begin to slow down our emissions.”

"A Christian feast that means the birth of Jesus, Christmas is widely celebrated and enjoyed in all the United States and the world. The feast always falls on December 25 (regardless of the day of the week), and is usually accompanied by decorations, gifts and special meals.
Specifically, the legend behind Christmas (and the one that is told to most children) is that Santa Claus, an old bearded, muscular, cheerful and red shirt dress living in the North Pole, spends the year making gifts with his elves, or small, festive, enthusiastic Santa-assist. All children who behave throughout the year are admitted to the Good List, and presumably will receive their desired gifts at Christmas, while those who do not behave are placed on the Naughty List, and presumably (although the matter is determined by the parents) will receive a piece of coal.
Santa Claus is said to fly around the Christmas sky on a sled driven by its magical reindeer, or cold-resistant, mythically driven, individually called animals, delivering gifts to each child's home in the process. Santa is also expected to slide through chimneys to deliver these gifts (homes not equipped with fireplaces could ""leave the front door cracked open""), and children sometimes arrange cookies or other treats on a plate for him to enjoy.
Gifts are placed under a Christmas tree, or a pine tree that is decorated with ornaments and/or lights and is symbolic of the party. In addition, smaller gifts can be placed inside a sock, or a piece of fabric in the form of a sock, specific to the holiday that is usually hung on the mantle of a fireplace (homes without fireplace can use the wall). The ornaments of a Christmas tree, or hanging ornaments, typically spherical, in addition to the above-mentioned lights, may be accompanied by a star, or a representation of the Star of Jerusalem that the Three Apostles followed while bringing gifts from the Child Jesus and honoring him, in the Bible.

"Although they refer mainly to moral issues, Cockburn's philosophical writings (which are taken here to include Mr. Locke's defense of human understanding (hereinafter, defense), Observations on some writers and Observations on the principles and reasonings of Dr. Rutherforth's essay) address a number of philosophical issues. In Defense, he answers Burnet on a number of questions concerning the deficiencies of Locke's empiricism, which include not only moral knowledge, but also the knowledge that human beings can have of the truthfulness of God and the immortality of the human soul. There is also a wide range of topics addressed in his work Observations on some Writers, in which Cockburn begins by addressing several philosophical issues – the necessity, the infinity of space, and the nature and existence of spirits with respect to the notion of substance. This latter discussion generally revolves around epistemological concerns about the knowledge of the real essences and the nature of the substance, in which it holds that spirits must have an extension of a species to be suitable substances. He makes this argument by appealing to a widely Lockean view of the substance.
However, it is his moral theory that is most prominently emphasized through his works. Cockburn dealt mainly with dealing with the flaws and strengths of some of the dominant issues in moral theory at this time. Cockburn's own position is an amalgam of three dominant strains of 18th-century morality: moral rationalism, moral fitness theory, and moral sense theory. Moral rationalism is, in general terms, the view that morality is the result of a rational process, by which the mind reasons over moral ideas and creates moral rules (although many thinkers, such as Cockburn, argued that the mind, by this process, is in fact somehow discovering eternal moral rules). The theory of moral fitness is a rationalist theory that includes the notion that the human mind is able to understand the various moral relationships that result from the essential nature of things in the universe; for example, the nature of human beings and God creates a relationship that requires the loyalty of human beings to their superior (this view was made more famous by Samuel Clarke). The theory of moral sense is the view that humans possess a special sensory ability that can determine, pre-rationally, what is good or bad (This vision was made more famous by Shaftesbury and Hutcheson). However, for many theorists, such as Cockburn, this sensory information is not definitive, but is seen as an aid to moralization that can and should be corrected by reason.
Cockburn's first philosophical work, Defense is a response to the work of one of Locke's critics, Thomas Burnet. In a series of critical pamphlets, Burnet raised doubts about the sustainability of Locke's epistemology as a basis, among other things, for moral knowledge. In the Essay and other works, Locke had suggested that morality could be known for reason and had emphasized the demonstrative character of morality, thus claiming the certainty with which moral ideas could be known. However, Locke never provided an explicit account of how fundamental moral ideas are derived. Burnet concludes that Locke's epistemology is simply insufficient for the task, and that moral ideas, in Locke's system, remain as uncertain as the ideas of God's nature and the immortality of the soul. Burnet uses his criticism of Locke as a springboard for his own moral position, best described as a mark of moral sense theory, in which consciousness is the human capacity to empirically discern the moral value of acts. In other words, for Burnet, one can, by observing a certain set of circumstances, know with immediate certainty whether that act is morally good or bad.",C2
"In general we think that the observations we make are capable of justifying some expectations or predictions about the observations we have not yet made, as well as general statements that go beyond what we have observed. For example, the observation that bread of a certain appearance has been nourishing up to now seems to justify the expectation that the next similar piece of bread that as well will be nutritious, as well as the claim that bread of this type is generally nutritious. Such inferences from the observed to the unobserved, or general laws, are known as “inductive inferences”.
The original source of what has become known as the “problem of induction” is in Book 1, Part iii, Section 6 of A Treaty of Human Nature by David Hume, published in 1739. In 1748, Hume gave a shorter version of the argument in Section iv of A Research on Human Understanding. Throughout this article we will refer to the Treaty as “T”, and to Research as “E”.
Hume asks why we come to our beliefs about the unobserved on the basis of inductive inferences. It presents an argument in the form of a dilemma that seems to rule out the possibility of any reasoning from the premises to the conclusion of an inductive inference. There are, he says, two possible types of arguments, “proven” and “probable”, but none will serve. A demonstrative argument produces the wrong kind of conclusion, and a likely argument would be circular. Therefore, for Hume, the problem remains how to explain why we form any conclusions that go beyond the past cases we have had experience with (T. 1.3.6.10). Hume stresses that he is not arguing that we do draw such inferences. The challenge, as he sees it, is to understand the ""foundation"" of inference — the ""logical process"" or ""argument"" on which it is based (E. 4.2.21). The problem of meeting this challenge, while evading Hume’s argument against the possibility of doing so, has been known as “the problem of induction”.
Hume's argument is one of the most famous in philosophy. Several philosophers have tried to solve the problem, but a significant number have accepted its conclusion that it is insoluble. There is also a broad spectrum of views on the importance of the problem. Some have argued that Hume's argument does not establish any far-reaching skeptical conclusion, either because it was never intended, or because the argument is somehow misspoken. However, many have considered it one of the most profound philosophical challenges imaginable, as it seems to call into question the justification of one of the most fundamental ways in which we form knowledge. Bertrand Russell, for example, expressed the view that if Hume’s problem cannot be solved, “there is no intellectual difference between sanity and madness” (Russell 1946: 699).
In this article, we will first examine Hume's own argument, provide a reconstruction of it, and then study different responses to the problem it poses.",C2
"Most fictionalist hermeneutics about some particular discourse maintain that although we normally utter phrases within the discourse in a fictitious spirit, we could, and perhaps sometimes do, use these phrases literally. For example, a fictionalist mathematician might argue that when we pronounce “there are prime numbers” in ordinary contexts we mean this in a fictitious spirit, but add that when we pronounce this phrase in the philosophy room we sometimes pretend to speak literally. But at least you can imagine a different kind of hermeneutic fictionalism. Let's take the case of the speech on fictional characters. A name like ‘SpongeBob’ is introduced for the first time to tell stories and to make internal claims to history; for example, the claim that SpongeBob lives in a pineapple under the sea. But there is disagreement about the proper account of the use of names of extrafiction fictional entities, non-narrative contexts, for example. in “SpongeBob is a better model to follow than Superman.” Some philosophers argue that this ‘extrafictive’ use of fictitious names shows that ‘SpongeBob’ has a reference outside of fiction (for example, referring to an abstract entity). Others argue that while SpongeBob can be used significantly in such contexts, it is, however, in such contexts, a mere non-remitting empty name, together with Zeus and Vulcan. But we can imagine a third kind of vision, according to which the names of fictional characters are, so to speak, only significant within fiction. Anyone attracted to such a view should tell some special story about apparent extrafictional truths (Brock 2002). Likewise, and returning to fictionalism, one can imagine a fictionalist about some discourse that denies that the relevant phrases can even be used significantly outside the pretense; that it holds that prayers only have the purpose of pretense.
The view may sound crazy. But Yablo (1998) approaches suggesting such a vision when he says, after having motivated fictionalism about the use of city names, he does not know what it would be like to use “Chicago exists” more literally than he already does. Let us call fictionalism according to which there is a literal use of the phrases in question with which ordinary use contrasts with fictionalism; let us call the other fictionalism meaning. The distinction may correspond to the distinction of Armour-Garb and Woodbridge (2015) between extrinsic and intrinsic claim. Armour-Garb and Woodbridge say that what characterizes the extrinsic pretense is that we could take the expression made literally, while in cases of intrinsic pretense, “the pretense is integral to the expression saying anything at all.” Using fictionalism is arguably the most common doctrine. But it is worth mentioning the meaning of fictionalism as well, both because some fictionalists seem to support it, and because the distinction will be relevant to some of the arguments against fictionalism. Armour-Garb and Woodbridge call their own semantic fiction brand and oppose what they call pragmatic accounts.
There are other distinctions in the general neighbourhood. Following Yablo (2001), one can distinguish between the following fictionalist points of view (on the discourse on Xs):
Instrumentalism: The speaker is not “really” asserting anything, just pretending to.
Meta-fictionalism: The speaker is “really” asserting that according to a certain fiction, the X are like this and so.
Object-fictionalism: the speaker is “really” asserting that the world is in a certain condition, namely, the condition in which it needs to be to make it a reality in the relevant fiction that the X are so and so.
Figuralism: the speaker is “really” claiming that something is in a certain condition, but perhaps not in the world; the X are functioning as representation aids in a figurative description of the Y, where the Y can be themselves representation aids invoked to help us describe even more objects.
Let us take the number discourse as our example, and consider these fictionalist views as applied to the number discourse. The instrumentalist said that in an expression of “the number of apples is two”, the speaker simply intended to say something; nothing was actually said. The instrumentalist did not present an alternative account of what the speaker was doing. The metafictionalist says something is stated in the lines of: according to the fiction number, the number of apples is two. The fictionalist object says that what is claimed is something that has nothing to do with the real world, something that would make true in fiction that the number of apples is two: that there is an apple x and an apple and so that x and y are different and nothing other than x and y is an apple. The characteristic objects of speech, the numbers, are mere aids that we use to make statements about how things are in the real world. Yablo's preferred point of view, figurism, is supposed to be a close cousin of fictionalism, but with an added twist. Figurism does not differ from fictionalism in what it says about the example used so far. The differences only appear when we are considering the statements intuitively about these supports themselves, the numbers, such as “7 is less than 11”. Sometimes, says Yablo, numbers — and other accessories — are used as simple representation aids, but sometimes they also function as represented things. (Provides as comparison “pinpricks of consciousness record less than pains of consciousness.”) In a typical expression of “the number of apples is two”, the number functions as a representation aid. But in “there are numbers” as the Platonist uses them, numbers work as things represented. And in “the number of cousins is zero”, as a nominalist you can imagine to use it when you do philosophy, saying something that given your philosophical point of view is true, they work as much as representation aids (“number”) and as represented things (“even prime”). (Compare also the catalogue of fictitious opinions in Kalderon 2005a, ch. 3.)",C2
"When you see the word Amazon, what is the first thing that comes to mind – the world’s largest forest, the longest river, or the largest Internet retailer – and what do you consider most important?
These issues have been raised in an arcane but extremely important debate on how to redraw the boundaries of the Internet. Brazil and Peru have objected to an offer made by the US e-commerce giant. for a new piece of the first order of cyberspace: “.amazon”.
The Seattle-based company has requested that its brand be a high-level domain name (now “.com”), but South American governments argue that this would prevent the use of this Internet address for environmental protection, the promotion of indigenous rights, and other uses of public interest.
Along with dozens of other controversial claims about names, including “.patagonia” and “.shangrila”, the issue is reduced to the heart of debates about the purpose and government of the Internet.
So far, differences between commercial, governmental and other types of identity were easily distinguished in each Internet address by “.com”, “.gov” and 20 other categories.
But these categories, or first-level generic domains (gTLDs) as they are technically known, are about to experience the greatest expansion since the start of the global website.
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) – a non-profit organization based in the United States that plays a key role in the governance of cyberspace – has received offers (each with a value of nearly $200,000) for hundreds of new gTLDs to join the existing 22.
Amazon has requested dozens of new domains, including “.shop”, “.song”, “.book” and “.kindle. But its most controversial application is for its own brand.
Brazil and Peru have requested the withdrawal of the “.amazon” application, saying that a private company should not be given a name that denotes a significant geographical area covering its territories and is also used for certain cross-border regions and organizations. “Allowing private companies to register geographical names such as gTLDs to reinforce their brand strategy or to benefit from the meaning of these names does not, in our opinion, serve the public interest,” said Brazil’s Ministry of Science and Technology.
Brazil said its views were endorsed last month by other members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Suriname and Venezuela).
Dozens of other protests have also been registered over proposed high-level domains that take on contested geographical, cultural or trademark names.
Argentina has presented an expression of its unhappiness that the U.S. outdoor clothing retailer, Patagonia, is claiming a domain name that has long been known as a region of spectacular beauty that also has its own parliament. “Argentina rejects the “.patagonia” request for a new high-level generic domain,” the government notes in an appeal. “Patagonia is a region relevant to the country’s economy because it has oil, fisheries, mining and agricultural resources. It is also a region with a vibrant local community and is an important tourist destination.”
Less convincingly, China has disputed the domain.shangrila, which is proposed by a hotel group of the same name. Beijing authorities say that the “shangri-la” label belongs to a region of Yunnan province, although it was only renamed as such in 2001 (long after the hotel group was formed) so that the local community could take advantage of the fame of the fictional paradise represented in the novel Lost Horizon, by British author James Hilton.
At a conference held in Beijing in April, the ICANN Governmental Advisory Committee, the leading voice of national governments within the institution, recommended that controversial proposals be frozen. They are expected to be discussed again at a meeting to be held in Durban in July. The first approved domain names should be in use by the end of 2013.

"The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs demanded Tuesday that CNN's Jack Cafferty apologize for the comments he made last week, in which he called the Chinese thugs and thugs and said that the products manufactured in China are garbage.
Cafferty used the microphone in his hands to defame China and the Chinese people - LRB- and -RRB- gravely violated the professional ethics of journalism and human conscience, Foreign Ministry spokesman Jiang Yu said Tuesday, according to Xinhua news agency, led by the state of China.
He said that Cafferty's comments reflected his arrogance, ignorance and hostility towards the Chinese people, ignited the indignation of the Chinese - LRB- at home and abroad -RRB- and will be condemned by those who safeguard justice all over the world.
CNN issued a statement on Tuesday saying: We are aware of concerns about Jack Cafferty's comments related to China in the context of the upcoming Olympic Games, which were aired at The Situation Room on April 9, 2008.
CNN would like to clarify that it was not Mr Cafferty's or CNN's intention to offend the Chinese people, and -LSB-CNN-RSB - would apologize to anyone who has interpreted the comments in this way.
CNN is a network that reports the news in an objective and balanced way. However, as part of our coverage we also employ commentators who provide solid opinions that generate debate.
On this occasion Jack was offering his firm opinion of the Chinese government, not of the Chinese people, a point that he later clarified in The Situation Room on April 14.
It should be noted that, over many years, Jack Cafferty has expressed critical comments about many governments, including the U.S. government and its leaders.
Cafferty, who appears daily on CNN's The Situation Room, made comments as host Wolf Blitzer was comparing today's China to that of 20 or 30 years ago.
“I don’t know if China is different, but our relationship with China is certainly different,” Cafferty said. We agree with the Chinese to our eyes because of the war in Iraq, on the one hand. They have hundreds of billions of dollars in our paper. We're also carrying hundreds of billions of dollars of trade deficits with them, as we keep importing their garbage with lead paint on them and poisoned pet food and exporting, you know, jobs to places where you can pay workers a dollar a month to produce the things we're buying from Wal-Mart.
So I think our relationship with China has certainly changed, he said. I think they're basically the same group of thugs and thugs they've been for the last 50 years.
He made a clarification of his remarks in the Situation Room on Monday, saying that by thugs and thugs, he referred to the Chinese government, not the Chinese people. It was not clear whether the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs was aware of the clarification when it held the press conference on Tuesday.
However, in the days following her comments, the Immigrant Legal Association launched an online petition condemning her statements as racist and despicable and demanding that CNN discipline Cafferty and apologize to the Chinese people. Almost 45,000 people had signed it on Tuesday afternoon.
In the petition, the association describes itself as a leading organization of legal immigrants composed mainly of people from China. According to its website, the non-profit group is based in Santa Clara, California, and was founded in 2007 as an organization dedicated to the social welfare of employment-based immigrant professionals.
The Chinese Daily state newspaper also said in an editorial on Tuesday that an apology is requested, calling Cafferty pathetic and pointing out, it is rare for the world public to hear such blatant discrimination against an ethnic group of people with such a derogatory connotation.
Others enraged by Cafferty's comments were urging a boycott of CNN advertisers. E-mail to a friend

"Senate Republicans again blocked Democratic legislation on Tuesday that would require greater transparency in who is behind much of the secret, often negative campaign advertising, filling the waves this election season.
DISCLOSE Act supporters gathered 53 votes in an effort to advance the bill, but did not reach the 60 needed to break a Republican Party filibuster. The Democrats unanimously supported the bill, while the Republicans voted unanimously against it. The legislation, which needs 60 votes to succeed, failed in a 51-44 vote on Monday.
Legislation would require tax-exempt groups involved in political advertising -- which are currently not required to disclose the names of their donors -- to spread the names of those who donate $10,000 or more. A similar vote ended on Monday with the same result.
During these elections, the external expenses of the Republican Party shell groups are expected to exceed $1 billion, said Senate majority leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, in a speech. The names of these front groups contain words like freedom and prosperity, but make no mistake: there is nothing free in a choice bought by a handful of billionaires for their own interest.
Democrats say the requirement is a much-needed response to the U.S. Supreme Court decision Citizen United, which opened the door to large amounts of campaign spending by corporations, unions, and other groups.
The political publicity of all these donations threatens to drown the voice of middle-class families in our democracy, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of D-Rhode Island, a main sponsor of the bill, argued.
Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, led the Republican Party's accusation against the bill and accused Democrats of drafting it to favor trade unions -- traditionally Democratic allies -- over other types of donors.
This legislation is an unprecedented requirement for groups to publicly disclose to their donors, stripping of a protection recognized and solidified by the courts, said McConnell, who has advocated for more outreach in the past, as long as it applies to all major actors in campaign financing, such as unions and court attorneys.
McConnell cited a recent analysis of the Wall Street Journal that found that unions spent $4.4 billion on campaigns between 2005 and 2011.
Obama Collects Campaign Money in Lone Star State
Predictably, unions are exempt from the kind of disclosure that Democrats now want to impose on others, McConnell said.
The Democrats disagreed with the Republican claim that trade unions are exempt from their legislation. However, concern for unions seemed to influence key Republicans such as Arizona Senator John McCain, a longtime vocal advocate for campaign finance reform, who said he would vote against the bill for that reason.
By conveniently setting a high threshold for reporting requirements, the DISCLOSE Act obliges some entities to inform the public about the origins of their financial support, while allowing others -- especially those affiliated with organized labour -- to fly below the regulatory radar of the Federal Electoral Commission, McCain said.
McCain argued that local trade union chapters would not have to disclose individual members' payments if the amount was less than $10,000.

"The terms “idealism” and “idealism” are in no way used only within philosophy; they are also used in many everyday contexts. Optimists who believe that, in the long term, good will prevail are often called ""idealists."" This is not because these people are believed to be dedicated to a philosophical doctrine, but to their view of life in general; in fact, they may even be pitied, or perhaps envied, for showing a naive view of the world and not being philosophically critical at all. Even within philosophy, the terms “idealism” and “idealism” are used in different ways, which often makes their meaning dependent on context. However, regardless of context one can distinguish between a descriptive (or categorizing) use of these terms and a controversial one, although sometimes these different uses occur together. Its descriptive use is best documented by paying attention to the large number of different “idealisms” that appear in philosophical textbooks and encyclopedias, ranging from metaphysical idealism, to epistemological and aesthetic idealism, to moral or ethical idealism. Within these idealisms more distinctions can be found, such as those that exist between subjective, objective and absolute idealism, and even darker characterizations such as speculative idealism and transcendental idealism. It is also remarkable that the term ""idealism"", at least within philosophy, is often used in such a way that it gets its meaning through what is considered its opposite: as the meaningful use of the term ""outside"" depends on a contrast with something that is considered to be inside, so the meaning of the term ""idealism"" is often fixed by what is considered to be its opposite. Therefore, an idealist is someone who is not a realist, not a materialist, not a dogmatist, not an empiricist, and so on. Since many also want to distinguish between realism, materialism, dogmatism and empiricism, it is obvious that thinking about the meaning of “idealism” determined by what is intended to oppose leads to greater complexity and gives the impression that behind such characterizations there is some controversial intention.
Within modern philosophy there are sometimes considered to be two fundamental conceptions of idealism:
something mental (mind, spirit, reason, will) is the ultimate foundation of all reality, or even exhaustive of reality, and
while recognizing the existence of something independent of the mind, all that we can know about this “reality” independent of the mind is considered so pervaded by the creative, formative or constructive activities of the mind (of some kind or another) that all statements of knowledge must be considered, in some sense, as a form of self-knowledge.
Idealism in the sense (1) has been called ""metaphysical"" or ""ontological idealism"", while idealism in the sense (2) has been called ""formal"" or ""epistemological idealism"". The modern paradigm of idealism in sense (1) could be considered as George Berkeley’s “inmaterialism,” according to which all that exists are the ideas and minds, less than divine or divine, that have them. (Berkeley himself did not use the term “idealism”). The source for idealism in sense (2) could be the position that Immanuel Kant affirmed (if not clearly in the first edition of his Critique of Pure Reason (1781) then in his Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics (1783) and in the “Refutation of Idealism” in the second edition of the Critique), according to which idealism “does not refer to the existence of things”, but affirms only that our “modes of representation” of them, especially space and time, are not “determinations that belong to things in themselves”, but traits of our own mind. Kant called his idealism position “transcendental” and “critical”, and it has also been called “formal” idealism. However, Kant's position does not provide a clear model of idealism at all. While Kant himself claimed that his position combined “empirical realism” with “transcendental idealism,” i.e., combined realism over outer, space-time objects in ordinary life and science with the denial of the reality of space and time at the level of things as they are in themselves, he also insisted on the reality of things as they are in themselves existing independently of our representations of them, thus denying their reducibility or representations or the minds that have them. In this way, Kant's position really combines the transcendental ideality of space and time with a kind of realism about the existence of things other than minds.
So instead of using Kant as any kind of model for epistemological idealism, in this post we will distinguish between metaphysical and epistemological arguments for idealism understood as a metaphysical doctrine, namely, that everything that exists is somehow mental. So, we agree with A.C. Ewing, who wrote in 1934 that all forms of idealism
have in common the view that there can be no physical objects that exist apart from some experience, and this could perhaps be taken as the definition of idealism, provided that we consider thought as part of experience and do not imply by the passivity of “experience,” and whenever we include under experience not only human experience but the so-called “Absolute Experience” or experience of a God as the postulates of Berkeley. (Ewing 1934: 3)
In other words, while reducing all reality to some kind of perception is a form of idealism, it is not the only way—reality can be reduced to the mental in other conceptions of the latter. Thus Willem deVries' most recent definition of idealism as the general theory that reduces reality to some form or another of the mental is just:
Approximately, gender includes theories that attribute ontological priority to the mental, especially the conceptual or ideative, over the non-mental. (deVries 2009: 211)
We also agree with Jeremy Dunham, Iain Hamilton Grant and Sean Watson when they write that
the idealist, instead of being anti-realist, is in fact... a realistic with respect to the most generally discarded elements of reality. (Dunham, Grant, & Watson 2011: 4)
namely, the mind of some kind or another: the idealist denies the reality of matter independent of the mind, but hardly denies the reality of the mind (or, on his own, that goes back to Plato, Ideas or Forms, as well as minds; we are not going to consider premodern forms of idealism in any detail). However, following Ewing (see chapters II, IV-V and VIII), we will distinguish metaphysical arguments from epistemological arguments for idealism. Metaphysical arguments proceed by identifying some general limitations on existence and arguing that only minds of some kind or another satisfy such conditions; epistemological arguments work by identifying some conditions for knowledge and arguing that only objects that are in some sense or another mental can satisfy the conditions for being known. In particular, epistemological arguments for idealism assume that there is a necessary isomorphism between knowledge and its object that can be obtained only if the object of knowledge is in itself mental; we propose that this is the difference between epistemologically motivated idealism and a more neutral position, which could be identified with philosophers such as Rudolf Carnap, W.V.O. Quine, and Donald Davidson, arguing that, of course, we always know things from some point of view, but any “external” question as to whether our view “corresponds” to independent reality makes no sense or at least does not answer for theoretical reasons. It is in order to preserve the distinction between traditional idealism and positions like the latter that we recommend maintaining the assertion that reality is in one way or another exclusively mental and the thought of epistemological arguments for idealism rather than epistemological idealism as such.
Of course, these strategies can be combined by a single philosopher. Berkeley does, and Kant does as well by arguing for the transcendental idealist side of his complex position. Others separate them, for example F.H. Bradley and J.McT.E. McTaggart built metaphysical arguments for idealism, while Josiah Royce and Brand Blanshard offered epistemological arguments.
In what follows, we will focus mainly on the discussion of philosophical theories that support or affirm support idealism on an ontological and/or epistemological basis. However, at some points in its complex history, especially in the social and philosophical movement that dominated British and American universities in the second half of the 19th century and during the first world war, idealism in any of its philosophical forms was effectively connected to idealism in the popular sense of progressive and optimistic social thought. This was true for figures like Bradley and Royce and their predecessors and contemporaries like Thomas Hill Green and Bernard Bosanquet. Recently there has been considerable interest in British or more generally English-speaking idealism as a movement in social philosophy, or even a social movement, but we will not pursue that here (see Mander 2011; Boucher & Vincent 2012; Mander [ed.] 2000; and Mander & Panagakou [eds.] 2016).

"An Austrian man who participated in a Nazi massacre of Jews during World War II and later obtained U.S. citizenship has been deported to Austria, U.S. officials said.
The Sachsenhausen concentration camp north of Berlin, where the United States says Krumpf worked as an SS guard.
Josias Krumpf, 83, lived years after the war in Racine, Wisconsin. The United States revoked its citizenship in 2005 after the Criminal Division of the United States Department of Justice attempted to denaturalize it.
Acting Deputy Prosecutor Rita Glavin announced the deportation of Krumpf on Thursday. It was not clear when he arrived in Austria, and representatives of the Austrian Ministry of Justice were not immediately available to comment.
His transfer ordered by the United States court to Austria is another milestone in the government's effort to ensure that people involved in crimes against humanity do not find refuge in this country, Glavin said.
The U.S. eliminated Krumpf because of his involvement in that and other Nazi-sponsored acts of persecution during the war, Glavin said.
Krumpf admits to being on duty on 3 November 1943, when SS guards at Trawniki Labour Camp in Poland shot and killed 8,000 Jews, including women and 400 children, in graves. Glavin said Krumpf said he had orders to shoot the prisoners who survived.
Krumpf also served as an SS guard at the Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp led by the Nazis in Germany and in slave workplaces in Nazi-occupied France, where prisoners under his watch built launch platforms for German missile attacks in England, Glavin said.
The November 1943 shooting was part of a larger Nazi operation called Aktion Erntefest, or Operation Harvest Festival, which led to the death of 42,000 Jews in three camps in eastern Poland in two days, the Department of Justice said.
In Trawniki, Krumpf said, he was assigned to watch victims who were still half alive or convulsing and prevent their escape by shooting them to death, the Justice Department said.
Krumpf, who was born in Serbia, emigrated to the United States in 1956 and became a U.S. citizen in 1964.
Her removal to Austria is part of an effort by several U.S. government departments and law enforcement agencies to identify and prosecute participants in Nazi persecution crimes living in the U.S., the Department of Justice said.
The Office of Special Investigations of the Criminal Division (LRB-OSI-RRB) started the operation in 1979 and has since won cases against 107 alleged Nazi criminals, the Department of Justice said.
The SBI also has a watch list for war criminals from World War II that has prevented more than 180 people from entering the United States, the Department of Justice said.

"On Sunday, Libya's interim parliament approved a new government, led by Prime Minister Ahmed Mitig, in a controversial vote that threatens to deepen the country's political and security crisis.
A total of 83 of the 93 members present voted in favour of the Mitig government.
The legislators of the General National Congress dominated by Islamists - LRB-GNC-RRB - challenged a threat issued by militias allied with the renegade general Khalifa Haftar, who promised to assault, assault and arrest members.
The threat was issued by the same group that attacked the CNG headquarters in Tripoli last week, triggering fighting throughout the capital that left at least four dead and dozens injured.
Shortly before the vote in Parliament, the EU Special Envoy to Libya described the situation as the country's worst crisis since 2011.
This is the worst crisis Libya has ever known since the war. Political forces must understand the anxiety of the Libyan people, who expect effective solutions to their daily concerns and problems, Bernardino Leon told journalists.
Leon called on politicians to work in an inclusive and democratic manner towards a political road map and to allow for early and peaceful parliamentary elections.
Also on Sunday, the outgoing Minister of Culture warned the insistence of CNG to confirm that the Mitig government could lead to more violence.
Today CNG is hitting the drums of the war. They want to bring the country into armed conflict for power after all peaceful and political means have been exhausted... They are leading the country to a direct confrontation, Al-Habeeb al-Amin told Libya al-Ahrar TV.
Mitig, a businessman from the city of Misrata, was elected to form a cabinet earlier this month in a disputed vote driven by Islamist blocs.
For months, divisions between Islamists and more moderate blocks within CNG have almost paralysed the political process and increased tensions in the country among militias affiliated to different parties.
The emergence of Haftar and his self-declared Libyan National Army intensified tensions last week, as the retired general called for the overthrow of CNG that he described as illegitimate.
Haftar also launched what he called an open war against Islamist extremist groups and promised to purge Libya from them. His campaign has expanded the country's divisions with Islamist and anti-Islamic camps.
In an effort to try to ease tensions, the Libyan electoral commission announced that early elections will be held on 25 June.
On Friday, Libyans gathered in Tripoli, Benghazi and other Libyan cities in support of the campaign led by Haftar. While some Libyans do not support the former general and do not want the military government, they support what he is doing.
But some say their campaign is an opportunist strategy that takes advantage of the growing discontent in Libya with a weak central government and a deteriorating security situation.
Haftar was once a general in the Libyan army under dictator Moammar Gadhafi, but had a fight with him and emigrated to the United States, where he lived for nearly 20 years. He returned in 2011 to participate in the revolution that overthrew Gaddafi.

"In the philosophy of religion, creation is the action by which God brings an object into existence, while conservation is the action by which God maintains the existence of an object over time. The main monotheisms unequivocally affirm that God created the world and preserves it. However, it is less clear whether creation and conservation should be conceived as distinct types of action. The issue has its roots in the medieval and early modern characterizations of divine action, and has received renewed attention in recent decades.
In the traditional prevailing point of view, conservation is continuous creation. Supporters of this view often say with Francisco Suárez that God’s creation and preservation of things are “conceptually only different” (Suárez 1597, 120). Jonathan Edwards, for example, says: “The created substance which God sustains, or which causes its existence at every successive moment, is wholly equivalent to an immediate production of nothingness, at every moment... So this effect does not differ at all from the first creation, but only circumstantially...” (Edwards 1758, 402; emphasis on the original). In other words, there is no real difference between the act of creation and the act of conservation, although different words can be used for them. Descartes, Malebranche, Leibniz and Berkeley express similar views. More recently, Philip Quinn also deals with both God's creation and God's preservation as a kind of producing the existence of a thing. We call the act ‘creation’ if it occurs in the first time the creature exists, and we call it ‘conservation’ if it occurs at a later time, but the action is the same (e.g., Quinn 1988, 54).
The alternative to this vision is that the act of preserving beings that already exist differs from calling beings into existence from nothingness. Some argue that each persistent creature plays a causal role in its continued existence, so that God is not the only agent as in an ex nihilo creation. Some also argue that conservation must be a continuous act, while creation occurs in an instant.
A large part of what is at stake in the debate is the relationship between divine action and creature action. Theorists of continuous creation may reject a distinction between creation and preservation as an attempt to attribute a divine prerogative to created things. On the other hand, those who support a distinction may consider the theory of continuous creation as (to borrow a phrase) “one of those high-minded philosophical depreciations of God’s works that are disguised as compliments to the person of God” (van Inwagen 1988, 46 n4). The debate also raises a number of interesting questions about causality, time and their relationships.",C2
"Amsterdam remains liberal for tourists, to whom the Labour Mayor recently assured that the city's coffee shops selling marijuana would remain open despite a new national law addressing drug tourism. But the Dutch capital may lose its reputation for tolerance by planning to send annoying neighbors to “scum people” made of transport containers.
The mayor, Eberhard van der Laan, insists that his controversial new £810,000 policy to combat antisocial behavior is to protect victims from abuse and homophobia from harassment. The camps where antisocial tenants will be resettled for three or six months have been called “scum people” because politics echoes the proposals of Geert Wilders, the far-right populist, who last year demanded that “repeat criminals” be “sent to a village by scum.”
But Bartho Boer, mayor's spokesman, denies that the plans are not liberal. “We want to defend the liberal values of Amsterdam,” he says. “We want everyone to be who he and she are, whether they’re gay and lesbian or facing violence and then being harassed. We, as a society, want to defend them.” According to Boer, villages are not “the usual nuisance between two neighbors where one has the stereo too high on Saturday night,” but “people who are extremely violent and intimidating, and in a clear situation where a victim is being harassed repeatedly.”
Those found guilty of causing “extreme chaos” will be evicted and placed in temporary “basic” homes, including transport containers converted into industrial areas of the city. “We call it a living container,” Boer says. The housing of antisocial tenants in these units, which have showers and kitchens and have been used as student accommodation, will ensure that they are not “rewarded” by being relocated to better accommodation.
The Dutch newspaper Parool has pointed out that in the 19th century the troublemakers were moved to the villages of Drenthe and Overijssel, which quickly became slums. But Boer insists that the administration has learned from past mistakes and is not planning to house antisocials together.
It would be more necessary to call them “scum houses” than “scum people,” Boer says, “because we don’t want to put more of these families in the same area.” After up to six months in these houses, scattered throughout the city, tenants will be found in permanent houses. The city government plans to move around ten families a year to this program, which begins in 2013.
Temporary housing will be heavily guarded, but antisocial tenants will also have access to doctors, social workers and probation officers. “They are taken care of so that the whole situation is not repeated in the new house they are in,” Boer says.

"Deutsche Bank made a small annual profit in 2020, its first since 2014, saying on Thursday that it had made big profits in its investment banking division.
Over the past 10 years, Deutsche has lost a total of €8.2 billion ($9.8 billion) and the return to profit marks an important milestone for Chief Executive Christian Cowing, as analysts had been predicting another loss in 2020.
“We have built firm foundations for sustainable profitability and we are confident that this overall positive trend will continue in 2021, despite these difficult times,” he said in a statement detailing the results.
The sewing was promoted in 2018 to turn Germany's largest bank after years of losses and fines for lack of money laundering and its role in the mortgage crisis.
Analysts expect Deutsche to make another profit in 2021, according to a consensus forecast of their estimates.
Deutsche said its net profit attributable to shareholders for 2020 was €113 million ($136 million), compared to a loss of €5.7 billion in 2019. Analysts expected a loss of some 300 million euros by 2020.
Deutsche's shares, which increased by 3.6% in Frankfurt's trade, were 1.3% lower at 08.15 GMT.
A big question is how sustainable the benefits will be like Deutsche, like its competitors, experienced a trade boom amidst market volatility linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.
This prompted its investment bank, whose revenues increased by 32% to €9,280 million in 2020, and 28% in its main sales and transactions of fixed income and foreign exchange.
However, low interest rates and the slowdown in world trade put pressure on the revenues of Deutsche’s other divisions, such as corporate and retail clients.
One regulatory source said that the boom in investment banking had provided positive relief for Deutsche, but although it is in a stronger position than a year ago, its global business force is still lagging behind competitors in the European banking sector.
The bank has been trying to be less dependent on its investment bank in an effort to stabilize its business.
Cosing, announcing 18,000 job cuts and the closure of his global equity business in a major renewal announced in 2019, said the investment bank should provide only 30% of basic income. In 2020 it accounted for about 40% of basic income.
Income from investment banking trade rose globally for the entire industry 2020, said research firm Autonomous in a recent report that said “nobody believes this is sustainable.”
Deutsche thinks a good part of his business is.
“We see a substantial part of the growth of investment banks as sustainable, even as markets normalize, as expected in 2021,” Sewing said, according to comments prepared to analysts.
Costura told the employees in a memo that the division had gone to a “good start” this year.
The bank, which broke the talks to merge with Commerzbank two years ago, is trying to adapt to a possible merger if an opportunity arises, the German bankers say.
A banker with direct knowledge of the matter said Deutsche is approaching the issue of potential mergers as consolidation pressures increase. The bank is addressing the issue, but it has no concrete plans, the person said.
Deutsche ended the year with a net profit of the fourth quarter of 51 million euros, compared to a net loss of 1.6 billion euros in the same period a year before and analysts expectations of a loss.",C2
"Barack Obama flew to Washington and his desk at the Oval Office on Wednesday, hours after delivering an election victory speech in Chicago in which he called for the country to join behind him.
“You voted for action, not for politics as usual,” Obama said in his speech, but there were few signs of his call being responded to, and the President faced the prospect of doing business with a hostile Republican-led House of Representatives for at least another two years and an imminent confrontation over spending and debt, the so-called “fiscal mirror.”
Unlike his election in 2008, it is unlikely that the President will have a honeymoon period.
Both the Republican Speaker of the House, John Boehner, and the Democratic leader in the Senate, Harry Reid, spoke of the need to work together to resolve the crisis, but it could become one of the biggest clashes between the White House and Congress under Obama's presidency.
While Obama easily overcame the challenge of his Republican opponent Mitt Romney, maintaining the swing state after the swing state, the election provided another reminder of how divided the United States remains.
Although the opening is not until January, Obama actually embarked on his second term on Wednesday. Having disappointed many supporters in his first term, he is now seeking to establish a legacy that will transform him from a mediocre president into a large one.
In addition to monitoring what he hopes will be a continuous economic recovery, he hopes to address issues ranging from immigration reform to investment in education and climate change, and, in foreign policy, from Iran to Israel-Palestine.
In addition to comfortably winning more than 270 votes from the required electoral university, it also ensured a higher proportion of the popular vote.
Boehner, in a statement, sounded conciliatory. He cited “the need for both sides to find common ground and to take action together to help our economy grow and create jobs, which is fundamental to resolving our debt.” Obama is reported to have called Boehner to start the negotiation.
Reid, so often in disagreement with Boehner, also sounded conciliatory, saying: “I see the challenges ahead and contact my Republican colleagues in the Senate and the House of Representatives. Let's meet. We know what the problems are; let’s solve them.”
Obama, in an interview initially off record during the campaign, expressed optimism for a “great deal” with Republicans, one that eluded him in 2011. The problem will come when the talks go into detail, with Republicans wanting to protect military spending while Democrats are looking for cuts. Obama has asked for tax increases from households earning more than $250,000; Boehner has rejected any tax increases.
The shares fell on the Dow in anticipation that the blockade would continue. At lunchtime, all major U.S. markets dropped by more than 300 points.
The new House, which will be formed in January, will look a lot like the existing one, which has a large Republican majority. The Senate also remained little changed, with the Democrats holding their scant majority, winning three and losing one.
In the presidential race, Romney won only one of the decisive states, North Carolina, while Obama celebrated New Hampshire, Virginia, Ohio, Wisconsin, Nevada, Iowa and Colorado.
In his victory speech in Chicago, Obama referred to the long queues to vote and said there was a need for electoral reform.
He returned to the great rhetoric that was his trademark during the 2008 elections, but he dispensed with it in 2012. Amid disillusionment with his presidency and harsh economic conditions, his campaign team decided it was inappropriate.
But after winning, he returned to the famous lines of previous speeches, once again returning to his 2008 slogan of “hope.”
Going up to the stand to the optimistic sounds of Stevie Wonder “Signed, sealed, delivered, I am yours,” Obama told the ecstatic crowd of supporters: “Tonight in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our journey has been difficult, while our journey has been long, we have risen, we have fought our way back. And we know in our hearts that for the United States of America the best is yet to come.” In a speech that lasted more than 25 minutes, after paying emotional tribute to his wife, Michelle, and her daughters, Malia and Sasha – as well as to his Vice President, Joe Biden – Obama returned to the message that first brought him to national attention.
“We are not as divided as our policy suggests,” he said. “We are not as cynical as experts think. We are greater than the sum of our individual ambitions, and we remain more than a collection of red states and blue states. We are, and forever will be, the United States of America.”
Obama made it clear that he had an agenda in mind for his second term, citing changes in the tax code, immigration reform, and, as he said, a United States “that is not threatened by the destructive power of a planet that is warming up.”
Shortly before, Romney had called the President to grant it. In a gracious speech in Boston, Romney told his supporters: “The nation, as you know, is at a critical point. At a time like this, we cannot risk partisan disputes and political positions. Our leaders have to get to the other side of the hall to do people’s work.”
He continued: “This is a time for great challenges for the United States and I pray that the President will succeed in guiding our nation.”
The campaign has almost been a referendum on Obama. Although there was widespread disillusionment with the slow pace of economic recovery and a high level of unemployment, the Americans decided to stay with him.
Historically, it would have been a disappointment for African Americans and many white liberals if the first black presidency had ended in failure, detained prematurely.

"For a momentous day at Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral for the families of the 96 people who died so unnecessarily at Sheffield's football field on Wednesday in Hillsborough, one phrase dominated above all: the truth. These were the most infamously abused words by a headline in The Sun newspaper, above the stories we now know, with extraordinarily shocking detail, were fed by the South Yorkshire Police to divert their own guilt from the disaster to the innocent victims.
Margaret Aspinall, whose son James, then 18, died in what should have been a day of joy, a semifinal of the FA Cup between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, said that families had been forced to fight, for 23 years, precisely for that: the truth. Aspinall, president of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, said that, although the loss of families would never fade, she was “delighted” by the unequivocal and “deep” apologies given by David Cameron for Hillsborough’s savage flaws.
The Hillsborough Independent Group had inspected 450,000 police-generated documents, Sheffield Wednesday and all other responsible bodies, and delivered its remarkable 395-page report accusing the victims and football fans of official misconduct.
Some of the events that caused the disaster, and the subsequent displacement of guilt by the police, have been previously exposed. But the depth of what families call a cover-up, particularly the deliberate police campaign to avoid their own responsibilities and falsely blame supporters, remained surprising.
In a concerted campaign – led by the panel, Peter Wright – the South Yorkshire Police published his story that drunk supporters or those without tickets had caused the disaster. The victims were given a blood test to detect alcohol levels. The panel said that it was “an exceptional decision ” for which it did not find “justification. ” When the victims had alcohol in their blood, the police checked if they had a criminal record.
The report, written substantially by Professor Phil Scraton of Queen’s University, Belfast, and unanimously accepted by the group of eight experts, found that “there was no evidence... to verify the serious allegations of exceptional levels of drunkenness, lack of entrances, or violence among Liverpool fans. ”
The report found that even though the nightmare began for the victims’ families, Wright met with his police federation at a Sheffield restaurant to prepare “a defense” and “a solid rock story.” The secretary of the South Yorkshire Police Federation section, Agent Paul Middup, told the restaurant meeting before Wright showed up: “The chief of police had said that the truth could not come from him, but had given the secretary a totally free hand and had supported him,” as did many senior officers.
The meeting took place only four days after the disaster. It was the day The Sun splashed its headline “The Truth” about lies fed by four high-ranking South Yorkshire police officers. Middup was encouraged to continue this police campaign of defaming Liverpool supporters for alleged drunkenness and misconduct and “transmitting the message – unity – by force. ”
The panel report upheld the argument made in parliament that the orchestrated change in statements by junior officers by senior officers of the South Yorkshire police amounted to a “black propaganda unit. “ The statements of the officers, presented as official police accounts to the subsequent investigation, were changed to eliminate criticism of the police itself in the day, and, to a large extent, to emphasize the bad behavior of supporters. The group considered that 116 out of 164 statements were amended “to eliminate or alter unfavorable comments to the South Yorkshire police. ”
The police had claimed that this was done only to eliminate the ""conjecture"" and ""opinion"" of the statements, but the group had no doubt that the operation, to elaborate a case rather than deliver truthful police accounts, went further. “It was done to eliminate police criticism,” Scraton said.
This propaganda did not convince the original investigation, which ruled as soon as August 1989 that the police stories of intoxication and bad behavior of the fans were false, and criticized the police for making the claims. The report revealed that Sheffield Wednesday's football field was insecure in crucial respects, that the Football Association had selected it as the place for the match without even checking whether Hillsborough had a valid security certificate, which it did not.
In this scenario of abandonment, it was the poor management of the crowd by the police, commanded by an inexperienced chief superintendent David Duckenfield, who was “the main cause” of the disaster. Police lost control off the ground, where 24,000 Liverpool fans had to be channeled through only 23 tourniquets, so Duckenfield ordered a large exit door to be opened and a large number of people allowed in. His “first - magnitude error, ” according to research, was the failure to close the tunnel that led to the already overpopulated central section of the Leppings Lane terrace.
The investigation report established it, but the police, fearless, repeated their claims to the subsequent investigation. His procedure was characterized by a decision by the coroner not to take evidence of what happened after 3.15 p.m. on the day of the disaster, thus excluding an emergency response that the panel found chaotic. The conclusion that 41 of the 96 who died could have been saved if the police and ambulance service had done their job decently is condemnatory of those bodies and, Aspinall said, difficult to consider for families.
In the light of the panel's report, the Attorney General will now consider requesting the High Court to annul the verdict of inquiry into the accidental death and the conduct of a new investigation. There may also be prosecutions, after all these years, of Sheffield Wednesday, South Yorkshire Police and Sheffield City Council, which failed to carry out their duty to oversee the safety of the football field. Trevor Hicks, the president of the HFSG, whose teenage daughters, Sarah and Victoria, died in love, said: “The truth is out today. Tomorrow is for justice.”

"- LRB-CNN-RRB- Marco Rubio's inside. The Florida Republican senator has announced that he is looking for the Republican presidential nomination, with an optimistic message that it embodies the promise of the American Dream.
With its youthful energy and Hispanic roots, it is tempting to see Rubio as the new blood the Republican Party needs to compete against Hillary Clinton in 2016. However, Rubio has been his worst enemy in what could have been his two signature issues: immigration reform and relations with Cuba. It has little appeal to Latino voters. And unless you can offer new ideas, your promotion to the Republican nomination will be steep.
In 2013, Rubio was a member of the Senate Gang of 8, which drafted a bipartisan proposal for comprehensive reform, including a path to citizenship for the nation's approximately 11 million undocumented immigrants. He later distanced himself from the bill after he faced resistance from the House Republicans, and now says he is in favour of a piecemeal approach, starting with securing the border.
His withdrawal in immigration means that Rubio has missed the opportunity to differentiate himself from most of the alleged Republican presidential candidates. It's a shame, because this issue was supposed to be your Latino voter business card.
Instead, Rubio has adopted a conservative approach typical of immigration. He believes that President Obama's Deferred Action program, which offers help for the deportation of young immigrants, must end. It has stated that the President's executive action on immigration, pending a review by the circuit court, sets a horrific precedent.
Meanwhile, both President Obama's Deferred Action program and executive action on immigration are overwhelmingly favored by Hispanics. No wonder the Latin Decisions research firm reports that, We find no evidence that Rubio's candidacy gets significant Latino support for his candidacy or for his party in general. Therefore, if Rubio has his ethnicity and personal history as the son of immigrants to win over his Hispanic companions, he is wrong.
In a private breakfast Monday for supporters, Rubio described running against a candidate in the race that is yesterday, and one who wants to take us back to yesterday. But when it comes to Cuba's politics, Rubio himself seems firmly trapped in the past. During the weekend, he described the recent thaw in relations between the two countries as ridiculous.
He has warned that Cuba is taking advantage of the United States. Here, he is an increasingly lonely voice. Most Americans support better relations with Cuba, as do most Cuban Americans. By clinging to the idea that isolating Cuba is better than getting involved with the communist country, Rubio has marginalized himself on an issue in which he could have provided insight and leadership.
Leaving aside immigration policy and Cuba, Rubio's political philosophy will be difficult to sell to Hispanics. He is a fierce opponent of Obamacare and wants the law to be repealed. However, the Affordable Care Act has led to a 12.3% drop in the rate of uninsured Hispanics, making Latinos the population with the highest insurance gain, thanks to the law. -LRB- In fact, Rubio signed his own family for Obamacare at the Washington exchange, taking advantage of a generous federal subsidy offered to legislators. - RRB-
Rubio favors a smaller government, while Latinos are more likely than the general public to say they favor a larger government that provides more services over a smaller government that provides less. And while Rubio doubts that climate change is caused by humans, The New York Times has pointed out that Latinos see global warming as a problem and favor government action on the issue.
Of course, Rubio is young and charismatic. But despite his work on the failed immigration law, Rubio has a significant lack of achievements to show during his five years in the Senate. In February, the Politico website reported that it headed the list of absent legislators.
Another weakness of Rubio is his lack of bold political proposals. Consider that your fellow Republican Party presidential nomination candidate, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, has been willing to present new ideas to the Republican base, such as reforming the criminal justice system and legalizing medical marijuana. Or that another Republican Party presidential candidate, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, feels totally comfortable with his image as a conservative fire. In comparison, Rubio seems prudent and inappropriate for the task of awakening Republican voters.
With his first jump in the 2016 race, Marco Rubio is positioning himself as the next generation of GOP leadership. Unfortunately, a fresh face in old ideas is not a winning combination, not for Rubio, and not for Latino voters.

"Although the term “nationalism” has a variety of meanings, it centrally encompasses two phenomena: (1) the attitude that members of a nation have when they care about their identity as members of that nation and (2) the actions that members of a nation take in trying to achieve (or sustain) some form of political sovereignty (see, for example, Nielsen 1998-9: 9). Each of these aspects requires elaboration.
raises questions about the concept of nation or national identity, about what it is to belong to a nation, and about how much one should care about one's own nation. Nations and national identity can be defined in terms of common origin, ethnicity or cultural ties, and while a person ' s membership of the nation is often considered involuntary, it is sometimes considered voluntary. The degree of nation-care that nationalists require is often, but not always, taken to be very high: according to such views, one's nation's claims take precedence over rival contenders for authority and loyalty. [1]
raises questions as to whether sovereignty requires the acquisition of full statehood with full authority over internal and international affairs, or whether anything less than statehood is sufficient. Although sovereignty is often considered full statehood (Gellner 1983: ch. 1),[2] possible exceptions have been recognized (Miller 1992: 87; Miller 2000). Some authors even defend an anarchist version of moderate patriotism-nationalism predicted by Bakunin (see Sparrow 2007).
There is a terminological and conceptual question of distinguishing nationalism from patriotism. A popular proposal is the contrast between attachment to one's own country as a definition of patriotism and attachment to one's own people and their traditions as a definition of nationalism (Kleinig 2014: 228, and Primorátz 2017: Section 1.2). One problem with this proposal is that love for a country is not really love for a piece of land, but usually involves attachment to the community of its inhabitants, and this introduces “nation” in the conception of patriotism. Another contrast is that between strong attachment and somewhat aggressive (nationalism) and mild (patrioticism), which goes back at least to George Orwell (see his 1945 essay). [3]
Despite these definitional concerns, there is a good deal of agreement on the classical, historically paradigmatic form of nationalism. It typically presents the supremacy of the nation's claims over other claims of individual loyalty and full sovereignty as the persistent goal of its political agenda. Territorial sovereignty has traditionally been seen as a defining element of state power and essential to the nation. He was praised in modern classical works by Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau and is returning to the center of the debate, although philosophers are now more skeptical (see below). Issues related to the control of the movement of money and people (in particular immigration) and the rights of resources implied by territorial sovereignty make the issue politically central in the era of globalization and philosophically interesting both for nationalists and anti-nationalists.
In recent times, the philosophical approach has moved more towards “liberal nationalism,” the vision that mitigates classical demands and seeks to unite pro-national attitudes and respect for traditional liberal values. For example, classical nationalists consider that the territorial state as a political unit is centrally “belonging” to an ethnic-cultural group and is actively charged with protecting and promulgating its traditions. The liberal variety allows the territorial state to be “shared” with non-dominant ethnic groups. The consequences are varied and very interesting (for more information, see below, especially section 2.1).",C2
"The National Security Agency (NSA) has obtained direct access to the systems of Google, Facebook, Apple and other U.S. Internet giants, according to a top secret document. Access to the NSA is part of a previously undisclosed program called PRISM, which allows officials to collect material including search history, email content, file transfers, and live chats, the document says.
The Guardian has verified the authenticity of the document, a 41-slide PowerPoint presentation – classified as an undistributed ultrasecret to foreign allies – which was apparently used to train intelligence agents in the capabilities of the program. The document states “received directly from the servers” from major US service providers. Although the submission states that the programme is implemented with the help of the companies, all those who responded to a request for comment denied knowledge of any such programme.
In a statement, Google said: “Google is deeply concerned about the security of our users’ data. We divulge user data to the government in accordance with the law and carefully review all these requests. From time to time, people claim that we have created a ""back door"" of the government on our systems, but Google does not have a back door for the government to access data from private users.""
Several top technology executives insisted that they had no knowledge of PRISM or any similar scheme. They said they would never have been involved in such a program. “If you’re doing this, you’re doing it without our knowledge,” one said. An Apple spokesman said he had “never heard” from PRISM.
NSA access was allowed by changes in the U.S. surveillance law, introduced under President Bush and renewed under Obama in December 2012. The programme facilitates comprehensive and in-depth monitoring of live communications and stored information. The law allows the selection of any client from participating companies living outside the U.S., or those Americans whose communications include persons outside the U.S. It also opens the possibility that communications made entirely within the U.S. pick up without a warrant.
Disclosure of the PRISM program follows a leak to The Guardian on Wednesday of a top secret court order forcing Verizon telecommunications provider to deliver the phone records of millions of U.S. customers. The participation of internet companies in PRISM will be added to the debate on the scale of surveillance by intelligence services. Unlike the collection of such call records, this monitoring may include the content of communications and not just metadata. Some of the world's largest internet brands are said to be part of the information exchange program since its introduction in 2007. Microsoft – which is currently running an advertising campaign with the slogan “Your privacy is our priority” – was the first, with the collection starting in December 2007. It was followed by Yahoo in 2008; Google, Facebook and PalTalk in 2009; YouTube in 2010; Skype and AOL in 2011; and finally Apple, who joined the program in 2012. The program continues to expand, with other providers coming online. Collectively, companies cover the vast majority of email, search, video and online communications networks. The scope and nature of the data collected from each company varies. Companies are legally required to comply with user communications requests under U.S. law, but the PRISM program allows direct access by intelligence services to company servers. The NSA document states that operations are “assisted by communications providers in the United States. ” The disclosure also supports concerns raised by several U.S. senators during the renewal of the FISA Amendment Act (FAA) in December 2012, who warned about the scale of surveillance that the law could allow and shortcomings in the safeguards it introduces. When the FAA was first enacted, the advocates of the statute argued that significant control of the abuse would be the inability of the NSA to obtain electronic communications without the consent of the telecommunications and Internet companies that control the data.
But the PRISM program makes that consent unnecessary, as it allows the agency to directly and unilaterally seize the communications of the company servers.
A graph prepared by the NSA, contained in the top secret document, highlights the breadth of data you can get: email, video and voice chat, videos, photos, voice chats about IP (Skype, for example), file transfers, social media details, and more. The document is recent, dating back to April 2013. Such a leak is extremely rare in the history of the NSA, which prides itself on maintaining a high level of secrecy.
The PRISM program allows the NSA, the world's largest surveillance organization, to obtain targeted communications without having to request them from service providers and without having to obtain individual court orders. With this program, the NSA is able to reach directly the servers of the participating companies and obtain both stored communications and collect in real time from the selected users.
A senior administration official said in a statement: “The Guardian and Washington Post articles refer to the compilation of communications under section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). This law does not allow any U.S. citizen or any person within the United States to be attacked. The programme is subject to the supervision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Tribunal, the Executive and Congress. It involves extensive procedures, specifically approved by the court, to ensure that only non-U.S. individuals outside the U.S. are targeted and minimize the acquisition, retention and dissemination of incidentally acquired information about American people.
“This program was recently reauthorized by Congress after extensive hearings and debates. The information collected under this program is one of the most important and valuable intelligence information we collect and is used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats.”

"This study investigated the economic effects of malaria on cocoa producers in Ondo State, Nigeria, using the ordinary minimum square regression technique. Descriptive statistics were used to identify strategies to reduce malaria infection among cocoa producers. The sample framework for the study was obtained from secondary data obtained from the Ondo Ministry of Health records of registered cocoa producers who had malaria during the production season in 2015. Multistage, systematic and intentional samples were used to select 180 respondents for the study. Some of the variables included: annual income of farmers, direct cost of malaria treatment, number of days of incapacitation and additional labour costs incurred by farmers during periods of incapacitation. The results of the study showed that the average annual income estimate was 524,096. However, it was found that the cost of malaria treatment and the additional labour cost involved had a significant impact on farmers ' incomes; the number of days of incapacitation had no significant impact on the incomes of cocoa producers.
Keywords: Malaria, income, regression of ordinary minimum squares and cocoa.
Introduction
Economic growth and development are achievable in any nation with a viable agricultural sector. Most developed nations in the world are characterized by technology-driven agricultural production activities. This has increased self-sufficiency in the feeding of its population. In developing countries, however, agricultural production activities are highly dependent on the rural population using manual labour. Because of the physical nature of agricultural activities, farmers ' health could be negatively affected by diseases such as malaria if they have little or no medical care. It has been noted that medical issues have a negative impact on Nigeria ' s agricultural productivity and that malaria has contributed greatly to poor health in Africa (Breman et al., 2006). According to Kwadwo et al. (2009), human activities, including agriculture, have been recognized as one of the reasons for the increase in malaria intensity worldwide, because they support the breeding of mosquitoes carrying the parasite. Mohammed et al. (2018) stated that a higher percentage of small farmers in Nigeria are leaving (sic) rural areas. A typical rural village in the country is characterized by an indecent environment, poor housing, a muddy environment and water exposed in wells and sewers. These characteristics mentioned above are breeding grounds for mosquitoes that in turn inject malaria parasites into the rural population. Malaria as a life-threatening disease is caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female anopheles (World Health Organization, 2016).
Despite being a preventable and treatable disease, malaria represents about 212 million cases and 429,000 deaths worldwide in 2015 alone (World Health Organization, 2016). Over 80 per cent of the estimated malaria deaths in 2012 occurred in only 17 countries, with 80 per cent of cases occurring in 18 countries, with the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria jointly accounting for 40 per cent of the global total estimated (World Health Organization, 2012; National Population Commission and others, 2012).
The recurrent nature of malaria and the coincidence of the high season of malaria with the harvest season accentuated the burden on the rural poor who are already dependent on subsistence agriculture and limited survival options (Adhanom et al., 2006; Chuma et al., 2006). Thus, malaria is expected to affect farmers ' incomes in the agricultural season. Evidence of the economic burden of malaria is important to prioritize prevention and treatment services at the national and subnational levels and facilitates better allocation of resources in the health care system (McIntyre et al., 2006; Larg and Moss, 2011). Comparing the evidence of the economic burden of malaria from different environments, time periods, patient groups and epidemiological profiles is difficult (Drummond, 2015), therefore, traditionally, studies that have attempted to estimate the economic burden of malaria have focused on private and non-private medical costs associated with the disease, as well as some measure of the income lost as a result of malaria morbidity and mortality (Jefferey and Pia, 2002).
There is no empirical evidence to investigate the effects of malaria on the incomes of cocoa producers, although studies have been conducted on the effects of malaria on farmers in general. Studies have also focused on how the disease generally affects cocoa producers; however, there is no study focusing on the economic effects of malaria on cocoa producers. Intensified and increased commitment and financial allocation for malaria prevention and control measures have reduced the burden of malaria mortality among children under five years of age by 29 per cent worldwide within five years of 2010 (World Health Organization, 2016), so a little understanding of the problems of malaria for cocoa producers will help policymakers, especially non-governmental organizations interested in boosting cocoa exports among developing countries, to formulate appropriate policies aimed at reducing the incidence of malaria among cocoa producers.",C2
"The South Korean Red Cross has offered $8.4 million in flood relief to North Korea, news agency Yonhap said Tuesday.
The aid includes medical kits, food and emergency supplies, South Korea's Ministry of Unification spokesman Chun Hae-sung told reporters.
The Red Cross is Seoul's main channel for humanitarian aid to North Korea. The communist nation has not responded to the offer, Chun was quoted as saying.
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies blamed a sudden flood for displacing more than 23,000 people in a North Korean province bordering China.
The entire city of Sinuiju with its 350,000 residents is without drinking water at this time because the main pumping station was flooded, said Henk Schipper, Red Cross water and sanitation delegate in North Korea.
In August, nearly 260,000 people in northeastern China and North Korea fled their homes when heavy rains caused the Yalu River to overflow their banks, state news media reported in those countries on Sunday.
Tensions between North Korea and its southern neighbour have increased since a May Seoul report blamed North Korea for the sinking of a South Korean warship in March.
The report, whose findings have been endorsed by the United States, states that a North Korean submarine sank the ship, the Cheonan, with a torpedo, killing 46 sailors.
North Korea denies that it was responsible for the sinking.

"In less than a week, Turkey will hold its first direct presidential elections, however, the mood about the country can hardly be described as electric.
This is strange given the usual enthusiasm for the elections in Turkey, the historic importance of this survey, and the exceptionally high level of socio-political tensions in recent years.
In addition to the summer heat and Muslim fast month of Ramadan, the relative calm could be explained by the widespread expectation that Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, candidate of the AKP ruler, will emerge triumphant from the polls, either in the first or second round.
Erdogan understands power and pursues it like no other politician in modern Turkish history.
It has stricter control over all key state institutions, except perhaps the Constitutional Court. He also has a deeply emotional relationship with his followers, who gather around his leader with more passion as he faces a tougher opposition to his increasingly personal government.
This is how it has survived massive anti-government protests, a damaging enmity with former Islamist allies and a high-profile corruption scandal, a terribly poorly managed industrial disaster and successive foreign policy debacles -- the latest is the kidnapping of 49 Turkish diplomats and consulate workers in Mosul by ISIS militants, whose rise some critics attribute in part to the open border policy of the AKP government to fight jihadists in Syria -- all in the space of a year.
This could also explain the gloomy tone around many of his opponents, who seem to believe that having been so close to realizing his long-standing ambition to become Turkey's first popularly elected president, Erdogan will not miss the opportunity.
But calm must not overshadow the critical importance of elections.
Without a doubt, an Erdogan victory would not amount to a regime change for Turkey.
It would be the most crucial step in its transformation from an imperfect parliamentary democracy under military tutelage to a plebiscite democracy characterized by a powerful executive, weak or obedient legislature, and a charismatic leader-follower relationship that is regularly reaffirmed in the general elections and referendums.
It would be a mistake to think of the presidency, under Turkey's current parliamentary system, as a ceremonial position that would deprive its occupier of the executive powers of a prime minister. Turkey has had ambitious presidents, such as Turgut Ozal - LRB- 1989 - 1993 -RRB- and Ahmet Necdet Sezer -LRB- 2000 - 2007 -RRB-, whose influence was controlled by hostile legislators or meddling generals. A President Erdogan would not face these obstacles: his party controls the parliament and the military have been tamed through EU-backed reforms and two highly politicized judicial cases.
The current constitution, drawn up by the military junta in 1982, gives the head of state important authorities, which Erdogan would push to the limit invoking the national will that he intends to embody; a demand that would be strengthened and further personalized in the event of his election.
Where would this scenario leave those who feel increasingly alienated, suffocated and marginalized in Erdogan's new Turkey? Another electoral loss would be sure to discourage even more those who expected to see some change in the political status quo after last summer's Gezi protests.
But in defeat, there could be a valuable and necessary lesson. The two main opposition parties, the secular Republican CHP and the nationalist MHP, have formed an informal coalition with the sole purpose of posing a numerical challenge to the relative majority of the AKP, with anti-Erdoganism being its main unifying cause.
Party leaders have chosen candidates and determined electoral strategies with minimal public consultation. Only a handful of people participated in the selection of Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, former Secretary General of the Organization for Islamic Cooperation, as a joint candidate for the presidency of the two parties.
Predictably, this uninspiring, ultra-pragmatic and top-down tactic fell short in local elections - LRB - even when the allegations of electoral fraud are taken into account, the AKP remains the clear general winner -RRB - and runs the risk of failing in the presidential election. More importantly, this style of politics is contrary to the popular, democratic and pluralistic vision that the gezi spirit has aspired to grasp.
Whatever the outcome of the presidential elections, those who wish this vision to be transformed into reality would benefit more from focusing on the long-term process than on short-term achievements, and from building organizational capacity at the local policy level rather than obsessing over the control of State institutions in Ankara.
Success in local politics paves the way for success in national politics, as Turkey's political Islamists have demonstrated over and over again over the past two decades. But a genuine democratic transformation also requires the return of political authority.
Since its founding as a republic 91 years ago, Turkey's over-centralized political architecture has allowed those who gain state control to force their will over the entire population.
The machinery that repressed ethnic minorities and pious Muslims in the past is now alienating non-practicing Muslims, alevis, LGBTI members and other social and political minority groups that do not fit Erdogan's vision of an openly religious neoliberal Turkey.
Only a well-organized movement that takes its strength from local politics and defends pluralism, decentralization and the democratic rights and freedoms of all citizens can break this vicious circle of repression and alienation.

"On Friday the Dalai Lama rejected a series of accusations from the Chinese government, saying that it does not seek the separation of Tibet and has no desire to sabotage the Olympic Games.
The Chinese authorities have blamed the followers of the Dalai Lama for instigating the riots that have razed Tibet.
Emitting a statement as he traveled to New Delhi, India, the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists asked China to exercise wisdom and initiate meaningful dialogue with the Tibetan people.
Beijing has blamed the Dalai Lama and his supporters for the violence that broke out in the midst of protests for Tibetan independence earlier this month, but China has sparked international criticism for its repression of the protests that began peacefully.
President Bush said Friday that he urged restraint during a telephone conversation with Chinese President Hu Jintao earlier this week, and noted that it is in his country's interest that the government have representatives who sit back with representatives of the Dalai Lama.
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, appearing with Bush in the White House, also called for meetings between the two sides.
It is absolutely clear that there are human rights violations in Tibet. That's clear. We have to be honest about what's going on. Rudd said he shouldn't talk bad about it.
The Tibet government in exile has said that the death toll of the protests has reached about 140 in the last two weeks, but the Chinese government’s restrictions have made it difficult to confirm that number.
Chinese authorities claimed 19 dead and said that most of the dead were innocent victims: Chinese Han, a target of Tibetans.
I am deeply saddened by the loss of life in recent tragic events. I am aware that some Chinese have also died. I sit down for the victims and their families and pray for them, the Dalai Lama said in his written statement on Friday.
He added that there was an urgent need to seek a peaceful and mutually beneficial solution through dialogue. Even at this time I have expressed my readiness to the Chinese authorities to work together to achieve peace and stability.
He repeatedly pointed out that he was not a separatist.
Chinese brothers and sisters, I assure you that I have no desire to seek the separation of Tibet. Nor do I have any desire to open a gap between the Tibetan and Chinese peoples, he wrote.
Instead, protesters seek meaningful self-government while they remain part of China, he added.
And, he said, despite my repeated support for the Beijing Olympic Games, the Chinese authorities, with the intention of creating a division between the Chinese people and me, the Chinese authorities claim that I am trying to sabotage the games.
The protests, which began on the 49th anniversary of a failed Tibetan uprising, have threatened to overshadow Beijing's role as host of the Summer Olympics in August.
In his statement, the Dalai Lama complained that coverage of recent events in Tibet by Chinese state media, using deception and distorted images, could sow the seeds of racial tension with unpredictable long-term consequences. This is of great concern to me.
However, China's state media has accused some Western news agencies, including CNN, of distorting coverage of the riots to make China look bad and protesters look like innocent victims.
A headline Friday on the English website of Chinese official news agency Xinhua read the anti-CNNWeb site reflects the condemnation of the Chinese people. The article offered a link to a site where Chinese bloggers criticize CNN coverage.
In a statement, CNN said, “We have provided full coverage of all sides of this story, adding that the network’s reputation is based on accurately and impartially reporting global news. Read the full statement

I. INTRODUCTION
Deep learning [1] is providing great strides in solving problems that have resisted many attempts to
machine learning and the artificial intelligence community in
the past. As a result, it is currently being used to decrypt
difficult scientific problems on an unprecedented scale, for example. in
brain circuit reconstruction [2]; analysis of mutations in
DNA [3]; prediction of the structure-activity of the potential drug
molecules [4], and analysis of particle accelerator data [5]
[6]. Deep neural networks have also become the preferred ones
choice to solve many difficult tasks in the recognition of speech [7] and the understanding of natural language [8].
In the field of Computer Vision, deep learning became the
center of attention after Krizyevsky et al. [9] has shown that:
impressive performance of a convolutional neural network
(CNN) [10] based on a large-scale model
visual recognition task [11] in 2012. A significant credit for
the current popularity of deep learning can also be attributed
to this seminal work. Since 2012, the Computer Vision community has made numerous and valuable contributions to
the research of learning, which allows you to offer solutions for
problems encountered in medical science [21] to mobile telephony
applications [179]. The recent advance in artificial intelligence in the form of AlphaGo tabula-rasa learning
Zero [14] also owes a fair share to deep residual nets
(ResNets) [15] which were originally proposed for the task of
image recognition.
With continuous enhancements of the deep neural network
models [15], [144], [166]; open access to efficient deep learning software libraries [175]–[177]; and easy availability of
hardware needed to train complex models, deep learning
is rapidly reaching maturity to enter critical security applications, for example. motor vehicles [12], [180],
surveillance [13], detection of briefcases [34], [107], drones and
robotics [155], [178], and voice command recognition [7].
With recent developments in the real world such as ATM facial recognition [181] and Face ID security on mobile phones [182],
It is clear that in-depth learning solutions, in particular
source of computer vision problems are about to play
an important role in our daily lives.",C2
"f we are going to discuss the question of whether there is a need for moral principles, we need an idea of what we mean by ""moral principle"". Unfortunately there are two radically different concepts to what moral principles are. The first conception, the ‘absolute’ conception, takes a moral principle to be a universal claim in the sense that all actions of a certain kind are generally incorrect (or correct). The principle ‘do not break your promises’ can be expressed in several ways: ‘it is wrong to break your own promises,’ ‘all actions involving breaking a promise are wrong,’ and so on. In absolute conception, all this means that each and every act of breaking a promise is a wrong action, anything else that can be said by it. Every action of this kind is in general wrong, despite any redemptive features it may have.
There is a very different way to understand a moral principle, as ‘contributive’ rather than absolute. Understandd in this second way, our principle holds that if an action involves breaking a promise, that counts against it. Action is worse because it is a promise that breaks. Of course, it may be worse to be a breaker of promises, but better for some other feature it has, being kind means, let's say. The contributory conception of moral principles allows more than one principle to be applied to the case before us, since it holds that each principle is, so to speak, partial; each one specifies how things are only in a certain respect. But actions have many relevant characteristics, some count for and others against. If the action is generally correct or incorrect it can only be determined by the general balance of the right and the wrong in it. The contributory principles do not tell us by themselves how to determine that balance. They only specify contributions one by one, and leave us to find out how they add up. Some people assume that the principles themselves can be classified in order of importance; if that were correct, it would be of some help to us in the elaboration of what matters most in a given case. Others assume that such a lexicon order is not available, and that the matter is left to ‘trial’ without help.
Since there are two very different concepts from what a moral principle says, our discussion will have to address both possibilities. If particularism is true, there is not much room for moral principles of any kind.",C2
"Buber's best-known work is the short philosophical essay I and Thou (1923), whose basic principles he had to modify but never abandon. In this work, Buber gives expression to the intuition that we need to resist the temptation to reduce human relations to the simple or Apollonius or Dionysian, rational or romantic way of relating to others. We are beings who can enter into dialogical relationships not only with other humans, but with other animated beings, such as animals, or a tree, as well as with the Divine You. The duality of relations and, in their extreme, their coincidence, can serve as the key to Buber's mature thinking above all, from his approach to biblical faith to his practical policy in matters of Jewish-Arab relations in Palestine. You and I were first translated into English in 1937 by Ronald Gregor Smith and later by Walter Kaufmann. The original German was an instant classic and remains printed today. In the 1950s and 1960s, when Buber traveled and gave lectures for the first time in the U.S., the essay became popular in the English-speaking world as well.
While prior to World War I Buber had promoted an aesthetic of unity and unification, his later writings embrace a harsher and more elementary dualism. Buber was always opposed to the philosophical monism, which identified with Bergson, and opposed the “immersion doctrines”, which he identified with Buddhism. Complicated by the undifferentiated form of mystical experience (as sought by the medievals, including Eckhart, as an annihilation of self), the deeply dualistic view of the world presented in I and YOU refers to the coincidence of Cusa as an expression of human boundaries. Buber’s text reduces the relationship between people, animated objects and deity to three expressive meanings: “I”, “You” and “Lo”. They are the elementary variables whose combination and re-combination structure all experiences as relational. Individual elements realize in relationships, forming tractters that break into life, grow, disappear, and relive. Human intersubjectivity affirms the polymorphic encounter I-Thou. Based on the assertion that I do not exist isolated apart from the relationship with another, dialogue or “meeting” transforms each figure into a center of ultimate and mysterious value whose presence eludes the concepts of instrumental language. The heteronomic revelation of a singular presence calls the subject to an open relationship, a living pattern, which defies meaning, logic and proportion; while the I-It relationship, at its most degenerate stage, assumes the fixed form of objects that one can measure and manipulate. At the center of this model of existence is the notion of encounter as ""revelation"". As Buber understands, revelation is the revelation of ""presence"" (Gegenwart). Unlike the ""object"" (Gegenstand), the presence revealed by revelation as encounter occupies the space ""between"" the subject and another (tree, person, work of art, God). This space “between” is defined as “mutuous” (gegenseitig). Contrast with the Kantian concept of experience (Erfahrung), Erlebnis (encounter), or revelation of pure presence, is an ineffable, pure form that does not carry an apex of defined conceptual or linguistic content or object-like. Buber always insisted that the dialogic principle, that is, the duality of the primary words (Urworte) he called the I-Thou and the I-It, was not an abstract conception but an ontological reality to which he pointed but which could not be adequately represented in discursive prose.
The confusion (and/or confusion) between philosophy and religion is especially marked in Me and You. While Buber seems to lack a fully elaborate epistemology and sometimes delights in paradoxes bordering on mystical theology, it has been argued that Buber effectively resolved the inherent “difficulty of dialogues that reflects on and speaks of a human reality about which, in his own words, one cannot think and speak properly” (Bloch [1983] p. 62). The debates on the strength and weakness of Me and You as the basis of a system are based, in part, on the assumption that the five-volume project, to which this book was to serve as a prolegomenon (a project abandoned Buber), was in fact philosophical. Buber's lectures at the Freies jüdisches Lehrhaus and his courses at the University of Frankfurt, as well as letters to Rosenzweig show that, at the time of his writing, he was concerned about a new approach to the phenomenology of religion (cf. Schottroff, Zank). In Buber's cyclical conception of the history of religions, the revelation of presence mixes and animates the living and lived forms of historical religion (institutions, texts, rituals, images and ideas), becoming ossified and rigid and object-like over time, but structurally open to the force of renewal based on new forms of encounter as revelation. The history of religion described by Buber in the final words of Me and You is a spiral figure that contracts and intensifies that it has redemption as its telos. It would be artificial, however, to separate Buber's interest in religious phenomena from his interest in a general philosophical anthropology. Rather, Buber seems to have tried to find one in the other, or - put differently - to make religious belief and perceptive practice in the light of a general philosophical anthropology.",C2

"Body allergy tests are convincing thousands of people to take unnecessary treatments and put themselves or their children on inadequate diets, sometimes resulting in malnutrition, said a group of experts and charities. Allergies and food intolerances are increasing, but the confusion between the two, as well as the many wrong diagnoses, are causing real harm, said the Sense About Science information organization, which has produced a guide in collaboration with allergy specialists and charities.
“It’s probably the biggest disaster for scientific communication, where myths, misinterpreted studies, and charlatans clash with inadequate and excessive diagnosis,” said Tracey Brown, director of Sense About Science. “The costs are huge – unnecessary actions for some and not enough for those whose lives depend on it.”
Experts fear that restaurants and catering are seeing so many people who claim to have allergies (which can be dangerous to the individual), when in fact they have a food intolerance (which is not), that they do not take all the precautions they should take when serving a person who has a genuine allergy.
“It matters a lot,” said Moira Austin of the Anaphylaxis Campaign. “If a caterer thinks someone is simply avoiding a meal because they don’t want to swell, they may be less careful. There have been a series of deaths in which people have gone to a restaurant and alerted staff who have an allergy to a particular food and food has been served containing that allergen.”
The guide says that most Internet and allergy tests purchased from stores have no scientific basis. They include a home testing kit that looks for specific IgG antibodies (immunoglobulin G) against food in the blood. Although these antibodies are part of the immune system’s response to infections, “the best medical evidence has shown that elevated IgG levels do not suggest an allergy,” says the guide. “The results are often positive in individuals who do not have an allergy or food intolerance.”
It also discredits a test, a mixture of acupuncture and homeopathy, which attempts to measure electronic resistance through the skin while the child or adult has suspicious food in his or her hand. Hair follicle tests are also useless, says the guide. “The hair is not involved in allergic reactions, so hair sample testing cannot provide any useful information about the allergic state.” Nor should people be tricked into thinking that allergies are caused by a “energy block” that can be diagnosed by muscle tests and cured by acupuncture.
“I often see children who have been given unnecessarily restricted diets because their parents assume, in good faith, that they have multiple food allergies based on ‘allergy tests’ that have no scientific basis,” said Paul Seddon, a pediatric allergist consultant, on behalf of the UK Cochrane Centre, an independent organization that evaluates medical tests. “This has to stop, which can only happen if we deny these ‘proofs’.”
Another pediatric allergist consultant, Adam Fox, from Guys and St Thomas’ Hospital in London, said: “I get a number of patients, and my colleagues too, who will come to send hair for analysis or who have excluded a whole range of food for their children. It's very hard to untangle that. There are two challenges. Children have to receive adequate diets, but more of this is the unnecessary avoidance of things that are not harmful, which has a great impact on quality of life. A child who cannot eat wheat or drink milk cannot go to parties.”
The conviction that a child's chronic lethargy or headaches or eczema are caused by an allergy takes a long time and many tests to prove or refute. It is tempting to go to an alternative therapist who will do a single test and provide a quick but inaccurate response.
Allergies are on the rise in developed countries. The percentages of children diagnosed with allergic rhinitis and eczema have tripled in the last 30 years. Although there is now a better diagnosis, the increase in incidence is real, leading many more people to suspect allergies are the reason for their own health problems or those of their children. The guide lists a number of myths about sources of allergies, from the suggestion that they are caused by E numbers in food dyes to “toxic overload” and fast food.",C2
"In hermeneutics, the interpretative experience is typically clarified in reference to understanding. In this context, when we say that we understand, what we mean is that we have actually achieved something through an attempt at interpretation; and, when we say that we do not understand, we mean that we have not really reached anywhere with our interpretation. For this reason, understanding can be described as a ‘success’ of interpretation (even if, from Heidegger, understanding is more commonly described as a fulfillment, realization, or promulgation). In hermeneutics, such a success of understanding is not measured by standards and methods typical of modern natural sciences and quantitative social sciences, as if our understanding derives from a repeatable experiment, nor by standards typical of much of modern philosophy, as if our understanding has undoubted epistemic foundations.
Now, philosophers associated with hermeneutics describe the success of understanding in various ways. However, the success of understanding is described, however, it is usually also described as edifying or educational. In fact, Hans-Georg Gadamer, the philosopher perhaps more closely associated with hermeneutics in our times, closely connects interpretative experience with education. By education, he has in mind the concept of formation (Bildung) that had developed in the classicism of Weimar and that continued to influence 19th-century romanticism and historicism in Germany (Truth and Method, Part I.1). [1] Education, as training, involves more than the acquisition of experience, knowledge or information; it refers to the expansion of our person through formal instruction, especially in the arts and humanities, as well as through a wide and varied experience. Consequently, the success of understanding is educational in the sense that we learn from our interpretative experience, perhaps not only on one issue, but also on ourselves, the world and others.
That the success of understanding is educational in this way can be clarified by an example, for example, by reading a text such as the History of Thucydides of the Peloponnese War. When we say that we understand this text, we mean that our attempts to interpret it (either rigorously, as in erudition, or more casually, as in evening reading) have come to something, perhaps: that in politics, prudent reasoning is not always persuasive enough to stop the tide of war. Certainly, we have not come to this understanding as a result of a repeatable scientific experiment or based on an undoubted epistemic basis. But it is not for this reason less educational. In this understanding, we have come to something that we can agree with or disagree with, something that in any case expands or changes our views on the role of reason in politics (and certainly also about public discourse and the causes of war), and, finally, something that can also teach us something about ourselves and about the world in which we find ourselves.",C2

"The private social audio application Clubhouse is attracting masses of new users from mainland China, where the U.S. app remains uncensored by the authorities despite the flourishing discussions on rights, national identity and other sensitive issues.
Western social media applications, such as Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, are banned in China, where the local Internet is heavily censored to remove content that could undermine the ruling communist party.
The Clubhouse app, launched in early 2020, experienced explosive growth in the number of users earlier this month after Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev held a surprise discussion on the platform.
Its chat rooms are only accessible through invitations from current members, and starting Sunday, invitations to the platform were sold between 50-400 yuan (7.73 - 69.59 dollars) on popular Chinese e-commerce sites.
Reuters directly observed several ‘club’ conversations in Chinese in which thousands of users heard extensive audio discussions on topics such as Xinjiang detention camps, Taiwan’s independence, and the Hong Kong National Security Act.
China's cyber authorities have become increasingly tight in recent years, expanding the reach of banned applications, media and social networking sites in the country.
Although Clubhouse is not censored, it is only available on iOS devices and is not available in the local Apple app store, both major barriers to its widespread use in China.
Mainland Chinese users can access the app by modifying the location of their app store.
It is not clear why the app is still unlocked in China, although some foreign social sites with small Chinese followers manage to operate under censor radar, including 8kun, a central hub for QAnon followers.
In a Hong Kong policy-focused club talk, activists, journalists, and artists discussed former President Trump and his support base in the former colony.
Another popular Chinese language club on the site starting Saturday involved a rare open exchange between netizens in mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong for the increase in political tensions in the region.
The discussion became a hot topic on China's own Weibo social media website on Twitter on Saturday.
“I don’t know how long this environment can last,” said one user in a popular Weibo post who liked it more than 65,000 times. “But I will definitely remember this moment in the history of the Internet.”

"In mathematics, the Taylor series of a function is an infinite sum of terms that are expressed in terms of function derivatives in a single point. For the most common functions, the function and sum of your Taylor series are equal near this point. Taylor's series is named after Brook Taylor, who introduced them in 1715.
If zero is the point where derivatives are considered, a Taylor series is also called a Maclaurin series, after Colin Maclaurin, which made extensive use of this special case of the Taylor series in the 18th century.
The partial sum formed by the first terms n of a Taylor series is a polynomial of degree n which is called Taylor's polynomial n of function. Taylor's polynomials are approximations of a function, which generally become better as n increases. Taylor's theorem gives quantitative estimates of the error introduced by the use of such approximations. If the Taylor series of a function is convergent, its sum is the limit of the infinite sequence of Taylor polynomials. A feature may differ from the sum of your Taylor series, even if your Taylor series is convergent. A function is analytical at a point x if it is equal to the sum of its Taylor series in some open interval (or open disk in the complex plane) containing x. This implies that the function is analytical at each point in the interval (or disk).
The Greek philosopher Zeno considered the problem of adding an infinite series to achieve a finite result, but rejected it as an impossibility;[2] the result was Zeno's paradox. Later, Aristotle proposed a philosophical resolution of the paradox, but the mathematical content was apparently unsolved until it was taken by Archimedes, as it had been before Aristotle by the Presocratic Atomist Democritus. It was through Archimedes' method of exhaustion that an infinite number of progressive subdivisions could be realized to achieve a finite result. [3] Liu Hui independently used a similar method a few centuries later. [4]
In the 14th century, Madhava of Sangamagram gave the first examples of the use of the Taylor series and closely related methods. [5][6] Although no record of his work survives, later Indian mathematicians' writings suggest that he found a series of special cases of the Taylor series, including those for trigonometric functions of sine, cosine, tangent and arctangent. The Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics further expanded its work with various serial expansions and rational approaches until the 16th century.
In the 17th century, James Gregory also worked in this area and published several Maclaurin series. However, it was not until 1715 that Brook Taylor finally provided a general method for constructing these series for all the functions for which they exist[7], after which the series is named.
The Maclaurin series was named after Colin Maclaurin, professor in Edinburgh, who published the special case of the result Taylor in the 18th century.",C2
"Scientists have implanted a false memory in the brains of mice in an experiment that they hope to shed light on the well-documented phenomenon by which people 'remember' events or experiences that have never happened. False memories are a major problem with witness statements in court.
Accused persons have often been convicted of crimes based on eyewitness testimony only to have their convictions overturned later when DNA, or some other corroborating evidence, is recorded.
To study how these false memories could form in the human brain, Susumu Tonagawa, a neuroscientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and his team encoded memories in the brain of mice by manipulating individual neurons. The memories of experiences we have had are made of various elements, including records of objects, space and time. These records, called engrams, are encoded into physical and chemical changes in brain cells and the connections between them.
According to Tonagawa, both false and genuine memories seem to depend on the same brain mechanisms. In his work, Tonagawa's team used a technique known as optogenetics, which allows fine control of individual brain cells. They designed brain cells in the hippocampus of the mouse, a part of the brain that is known to be involved in the formation of memories, to express the gene of a protein called canalrhodopsin. When cells containing carajordopsin are exposed to blue light, they are activated. The researchers also modified the hippocampus cells so that the protein of the canalrhodopsin was produced in the brain cells that the mouse was using to encode its memory engrams.
In the experiment, Tonagawa's team placed the mice in a camera and allowed them to explore it. As they did so, the relevant memory-coding brain cells were producing the canalrhodopsin protein. The next day, the same mice were placed in a second chamber and given a small electric shock, to encode a fear response. At the same time, researchers shone light on the mouse's brains to activate their memories of the first camera. In this way, the mice learned to associate the fear of electric shock with the memory of the first camera.
In the final part of the experiment, the team placed the mice in the first chamber.
The mice froze, demonstrating a typical fear response, even though they had never been caught while they were there. “We call this ‘inceptor’ or implant false memories into a mouse brain,” Tonagawa told Science.
A similar process can occur when powerful false memories are created in humans. “Humans are very imaginative animals,” Tonagawa said. “Regardless of what is happening around you in the outside world, humans constantly have internal activity in the brain. So, like our mouse, it is quite possible that we can associate what we have in our mind with bad or good continuous events of high variation. In other words, there could be a false association of what you have in your mind instead of what is happening to you.
He added: “Our study showed that false memory and genuine memory are based on very similar, almost identical, brain mechanisms. It is difficult for the bearer of false memory to distinguish between them. We hope that our future findings along this line will further alert legislatures and legal experts to how unreliable memory can be.”
Chris French, head of the Goldsmiths Anomaly Psychology Research Unit, University of London, is a leading researcher in false memories of people. He said the latest results were an important first step in understanding his neural base.
“Memory researchers have always recognized that memory does not work, as is often assumed, as a video camera, faithfully recording all the details of anything we experience. Instead, it is a reconstructive process, which involves building a specific memory from fragments of traces of real memory of the original event, but also possibly including information from other sources.” He warned that false memories created in mice in experiments were much simpler than complex false memories that have generated controversy within psychology and psychiatry — for example, false memories of child sexual abuse, or even memories of unusually ritualized satanic abuse, alien kidnapping, or “past lives. ” “Such rich false memories will clearly involve many brain systems and we are still a long way from understanding the processes involved in their formation at the neuronal level,” said the French professor.
Mark Stokes, a neuroscientist at Oxford University, said the experiments were a “tour de force” but it was important to put them in perspective. “Although the results seem to imply that the new memories were formed by artificial stimulation (instead of the real environment), this type of phenomenon is still far from the memory idea of most people,” he said. Rather, he said, it was equivalent to implanting an association that perhaps someone cannot place but that makes them distrust a specific environment for no apparent reason. “It is unlikely that this type of pairing can lead to the rich set of associations related to normal memories, although it is possible that, over time, that pairing can integrate with other memories to build a more elaborate false narrative.”
Mouse models created by the MIT team will help scientists ask increasingly complex questions about memories in people. “Now that we can reactivate and change the content of memories in the brain, we can start asking questions that were once the realm of philosophy,” said Steve Ramirez, Tonagawa’s colleague at MIT. “Are there multiple conditions that lead to the formation of false memories? Can false memories be artificially created? What about false memories for more than contexts – false memories for objects, food, or other mice? These are the science fiction questions that can be addressed experimentally in the laboratory.
As technology develops, the Frenchman said, scientists need to think carefully about its uses. “Whatever means is used to implant false memories, we need to be very aware of the ethical problems posed by such procedures – the potential for abuse of such techniques cannot be exaggerated.”

"Naturalism establishes an opposition between standards X (scientific, mathematical or scientific-mathematic) and other types of standards, e.g., astrological, theological, or common sense standards. Another example of standards that the naturalist sees on the wrong side of the tracks is ‘fundamental’ philosophical ones. Goodman and Quine (in their pre-naturalist phase) once began an article declaring that the basis of their nominalism was a fundamental philosophical intuition irreducible to scientific foundations (1947). Naturalists refuse to appeal to such rules.
An apparent problem with naturalism is that there seems to be no sharp boundary between science and non-science and between mathematics and non-mathematics. For example, the transition from physics to physics philosophy to physical-heavy metaphysics to common-o-garden metaphysics seems to be gradual. When a mathematician writes a research article, an undergraduate textbook, a popular book on mathematics, a book that exposes his personal philosophy of mathematics and his psychological associations with various mathematical theories, at what point exactly has he stopped doing mathematics? When research mathematicians meet after the seminar and agree on coffee that Riemann's Hypothesis is the most important problem in mathematics, is this a strictly mathematical affirmation or a personal judgment recognized by mathematicians as outside the province of proper mathematics?
Many philosophers follow Quine to quote a standard group of principles supposedly constitutive of scientific standards: empirical adequacy, ontological economy, simplicity, fertility, etc. (Quine 1955, 247; Quine and Ullian 1970, chap. 5). However, lists of this kind are unsatisfactory for several reasons. First, the principles come in different versions. However, it is doubtful whether the general versions are scientifically approved. Some writers claim, for example, that the scientific appeal to ontological parsimony does not extend to the postulation of abstract objects (Burgess 1998). Others argue that scientific appeals to simplicity are not better expressed by the totally general slogan ""Prefer any T1 theory to a less simple T2 theory (in this sense)"" (Paseau 2007). On the other hand, lists of this kind do not tell us how to balance the disclaimers with each other.
Since the explosion of scientific studies in the 1960s, more attention has now been paid to the nuances of scientific practice. However, a more precise articulation of scientific standards and their weights remains elusive. The existence of an algorithm that encapsulates the scientific method is generally questioned (although many humans apparently manage to implement the scientific method, so if the method is not algorithmic then neither are our minds). What is not questionable, however, is that your exposure currently escapes us.
Having said that, it is not clear how serious the border problem is for naturalists. Perhaps they can argue that there is a fairly sharp border, although it is difficult to define. Perhaps mathematicians know implicitly when something counts as a piece of mathematics and when it is a non-mathematical comment on mathematics. In any case, naturalism seems to survive the absence of an acute limit. It seems that naturalism can base its claims on a set of rules with blurred limits.",C2
"No one knows which one was the first: the economic crisis that destroyed Greece or Shisha, the drug now known as the “cocaine of the poor”. What everyone accepts is that Shisha is a murderer; and at 2 € or less a blow, he is one who has come to haunt Greece, the country for a long time in the front line of Europe's financial crisis.
“As drugs go, it’s the worst. It burns the inside of you, makes you aggressive and assures you that you become totally crazy,” said Maria, a former heroin addict. “But it’s cheap and easy to get, and that’s what everyone is doing.”
This drug crisis has put the health authorities in Athens, already overwhelmed by draconian cuts, under increased stress.
The drug of preference for thousands of homeless Greeks forced to go out on the street by poverty and despair, Shisha is described by addicts and officials as a variant of crystal methamphetamine, whose potential to send users to a state of senseless violence is backed by substances with which synthetic drugs are often mixed: battery acid, motor oil and even shampoo.
Worse still, it is not only easy to get, but easy to do, tailor-made for a society that sees little light at the end of the tunnel.
“He’s a killer, but he also makes you want to kill,” said Konstantinos, a drug addict. You can kill without understanding you've done it. And it's spreading faster than death. Many users have died.”
For Charalampos Poulopoulos, head of Kethea, Greece's pre-eminent anti-drug center, Shisha symbolizes the predations of a crisis that has led to record levels of misery and unemployment. It is, he said, a “austerity drug” – the response of traffickers who have become increasingly expert in the production of synthetic drugs designed for those who can no longer afford more expensive drug maxims such as heroin and cocaine.
“The crisis has given traffickers the opportunity to promote a new cheap drug, a cocaine for the poor,” Poulopoulos said at an addict center in Exarcheia, the anarchist bastion of Athens. “Shisha can be sniffed or injected and can be done in home laboratories – you don’t need any specialized knowledge. It's extremely dangerous.
Throughout Greece, the by-products of six consecutive years of recession have been brutal and cruel. Depression, along with drug and alcohol abuse, has increased dramatically. Crime and crime have skyrocketed as Greek society has disintegrated under the weight of austerity measures that have reduced the income of ordinary Greeks by 40%. Prostitution, the easiest way to finance drug addiction, has also skyrocketed.
“Desperation is such that many women agree to have unprotected sex because they will earn more money,” said Eleni Marini, a British-trained psychologist with Kethea. “Shisha has been linked to a very intense sexual drive, but it attacks your ability to think clearly and we are seeing many more pregnancies among drug addicts who engage in prostitution.” In 2012, two sex workers gave birth in the streets of Athens.
At a time when suicides have also skyrocketed and the spread of HIV infections has taken on epidemic proportions, drug addicts (a population believed to be about 25,000) have become increasingly self-destructive. And, according to experts, young Greeks marginalized by record unemployment rates (64% in Greece have the highest youth unemployment in the EU) are leading the way.
“The crisis has created a widespread sense of pessimism,” Poulopoulos said. “For those who might have left the drugs, there is now no incentive. Instead, there is an atmosphere of misery, where people who know they will not find work are becoming much more self-destructive. In Athens, where the economic crisis has hit hardest, Shisha is part of that.”
The conservative-dominated coalition government in Greece has tried to deal with the problem by expelling drug users and other homeless people from the city centre. A number of controversial police operations have swept the central streets, clearing crowded doors and shopping malls.
“But with such actions, the authorities are only sweeping the problem under the carpet,” Poulopoulos said. “What they are actually doing is further marginalizing these people by pushing them into the weapons of drug traffickers who offer them protection.”
Just as the demand for aid has never been greater, state-funded organisations such as Kethea have reduced their budgets by one third at the request of the “troika” – the EC, the ECB and the IMF – keeping the Greek debt-stricken economy afloat.
Since the outbreak of the crisis in 2009, Kethea has lost 70 of its 500 employees. The cuts occur despite studies that show that, for every euro invested in programs like Kethea, the state saves around 6 euros in costs for criminal justice and health systems. “The cuts we have witnessed are a false economy, a big mistake,” Poulopoulos said.
In the streets of Athens, the breeding ground for shisha, there is a growing fear that austerity not only does not work, but kills.

"Egalitarianism is a controversial concept in social and political thinking. One could worry about human equality in many ways, for many reasons. As currently used, the “equal” label does not necessarily indicate that the so-called doctrine holds that it is desirable that the condition of persons be made equal in any aspect or that people are treated in the same way in any aspect. An egalitarian might rather be the one who holds that people should be treated as equal, as possessor of equal fundamental value and dignity and as equally morally considerable. In this sense, a non-egalitarian sample would be one that believes that people born in a higher social caste, or a favored race or ethnic group, or with a stock above the average of traits considered desirable, should somehow count for more than others in calculations that determine what should be done morally. (For the idea that the basic egalitarian ideal is to treat people as equals, see Dworkin 2000.) Other rules of equal conditions or treatment could be considered independent or derived from the claim of equal status. Controversy also revolves around attempts to specify the kind of beings to whom egalitarian norms apply. Some may consider that all and only human beings have the right to equal status. Some would argue that all and only people have the same moral status, with personality criteria that exclude some humans from qualifying (e.g., the unborn fetus or severely demented adult human being) and including some non-humans (e.g., intelligent beings inhabiting regions of outer space beyond Earth). Some would argue that sentient beings such as non-human primates who do not meet a person's criteria have the right to equal moral status together with people. Some are advancing other points of view.
Egalitarianism can be instrumental or not instrumental. Given the specification of some aspect of the condition or way of treating people that should be equal, one might argue that the situation in which stated equality obtains is morally valuable, either as an end or as a means. The instrumental egalitarian values equality as a means to some independently specific objective; the non-instrumental egalitarian values equality for his own good—as an end, or in part, a constitutive end. For example, someone who believes that maintaining equality in a group of people fosters relationships of solidarity and community between them, and is desirable for that reason, qualifies as an instrumental egalitarian. Someone who believes that equality of some kind is a component of justice, and morally required as such, would be a non-instrumental egalitarian.
Equality of any kind can be assessed conditionally or unconditionally. One values equality in the above way if equality is considered valuable only if there is any other condition. One could argue that equality in the distribution of resources among a group of people is valuable, but only on the condition that people are equally deserving.
Equality could be considered desirable or undesirable. A separate and distinct range of questions concerns whether or not people should act to achieve equality or are obliged to achieve equality (see Nagel 1991). The argument to come often merges these questions, assuming that if equality is valuable, that is at least a good reason to think that one should make it a reality.
For those who regard equality as a requirement of justice, the question arises whether it is an immutable and timeless requirement or a variable requirement. Michael Walzer is one who seems to have this last opinion. According to Walzer, a society is only if and only if its practices and institutions are in accordance with the shared values and cultural understandings of its people. Democratic egalitarianism becomes a requirement of justice in modern societies, because this egalitarianism is an important underlying element of people's shared cultural values and understandings (Walzer 1983). But this appearance can be misleading. Walzer can argue that everyone at all times and places has the same moral right to be treated in accordance with the shared norms and cultural understandings of his people or group. Walzer can also argue that everyone at all times and places has equal rights against free assault by people looking for fun, whatever the shared belief of local people in this matter. In any case, we can identify clear examples of theoreticians who consider equality of a certain kind as an immutable and timeless moral requirement. John Locke maintains that everyone at all times and places has the same natural moral rights that we all must always respect (Locke 1690). The contemporary moral philosopher Thomas Scanlon holds that all people everywhere alike have the moral right to be treated according to the outcome of a procedure: what constitutes morally correct and incorrect action is established by the principles that no one could reasonably reject (Scanlon 1998). It is yet another question, to what extent this procedure raises different principles that cannot be rejected at different times and places under different circumstances.
Egalitarianism can be formulated with a variety of roles in mind. For example, an egalitarian rule could be proposed as a fundamental moral principle. As such, it would be a declaration of the ultimate rule (or as a member of the final set of rules) to which individual conduct and institutional arrangements should be adjusted. A final rule may or may not be appropriate for the function of guiding individual decision-making or serving as an explicitly recognized principle governing institutions and the formation of public policies in a given society. If individual agents and public officials are responsible through limited cognitive capacity, limited knowledge, or limited loyalty to morality to misapply the supreme principles, it is quite possible that these principles can be applied to a greater extent if they are not directly used as decision-making guides for the choice of individual and public policies. (On this subject, see Hare 1981). Following this train of thought, one could favor as guidelines for individual and public choice simple, easily understandable and easily implementable rules that are to serve as substitutes for the moral principles that are the final norms. Or one might argue that the final moral principles that set what is right and what is wrong are well adapted to be practical decision-making guides. The point is simply that we must distinguish these distinct roles that moral standards could play and avoid criticizing a rule in one role for appropriate standards only if it is understood that the rule is playing a different role.
Egalitarianism could be sustained as a moral requirement, a component of what we fundamentally owe to each other, or as morally optional, a desirable ideal that we could permissiblely reject. When affirmed as morally required, egalitarianism typically figures in a theory of justice. For the most part, the discussion in this post focuses on egalitarianism as a morally required component of justice, but when considering arguments against a version of egalitarianism, it is worth taking into account the possibility that the norm in question is morally desirable but not morally binding.
Given some specifications of the type of equality being considered, it is clear what it means to say of a number of people who are equal in the declared respect. If we deal with equal utility, then a group has equal utility when everyone has exactly the same. If we deal with equal dollar tenure, then people are the same when everyone has exactly the same number of dollars. But to say this still does not suggest a way to determine, in general, whether inequality is greater in one situation than in another, when different people have different amounts of good that we care to match in the two situations. Inequality can be measured in different ways, and no measure seems to be strongly supported by the intuition of common sense about the meaning of equality. (See Sen 1997 and Temkin 1993). This entry is generally abstracted from this issue on the assumption that we can unequivocally determine, for any ideal of equality, how to measure the degrees of inequality in all areas.

"Leading water scientists have issued one of the harshest warnings about the global food supply, saying that the world’s population may have to switch almost entirely to a vegetarian diet by 2050 to avoid catastrophic shortages.
Humans get about 20% of their protein from animal products now, but this may have to go down to just 5% to feed the additional two billion people expected to be alive by 2050, according to research from some of the world's leading water scientists.
“There will not be enough water available on the current farmland to produce food for the expected population of nine billion by 2050 if we follow current trends and changes towards common diets in Western nations,” said Malik Falkenmark’s report and colleagues from the Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI).
“There will be enough water if the proportion of animal-based food is limited to 5% of total calories and a significant regional water deficit can be covered by a reliable food trading system.”
Terrible warnings of water shortages limit food production as Oxfam and the United Nations prepare for a possible second global food crisis in five years. Prices of commodities such as maize and wheat have increased by almost 50 per cent in international markets since June, caused by severe droughts in the United States and Russia, and weak monsoon rains in Asia. More than 18 million people are already facing severe food shortages throughout the Sahel.
Oxfam has predicted that rising prices will have a devastating impact on developing countries that are heavily dependent on food imports, including parts of Latin America, North Africa and the Middle East. Food shortages in 2008 caused civil unrest in 28 countries.
Adopting a vegetarian diet is an option to increase the amount of water available to grow more food in an increasingly climate-erratic world, scientists said. Foods rich in animal proteins consume five to ten times more water than a vegetarian diet. One third of the world’s arable land is used to feed animals. Other options for feeding the population include waste disposal and increased trade between food surplus and deficit countries.
“Nine million people are already hungry and 2 billion are undernourished despite the fact that food production per capita continues to increase,” they said. “With 70% of all water available in agriculture, growing more food to feed another 2 billion people by 2050 will put greater pressure on available water and land.”
The report is published at the beginning of the annual World Water Conference in Stockholm, Sweden, where 2,500 politicians, United Nations bodies, non-governmental groups and researchers from 120 countries meet to address global water supply problems.
Competition for water between food production and other uses will increase pressure on essential resources, scientists said. “The UN predicts that we must increase food production by 70% by the middle of the century. This will put additional pressure on our already stressed water resources, at a time when we also need to allocate more water to meet global energy demand – which is expected to increase by 60% in the next 30 years – and generate electricity for the 1.3 billion people who currently do not have it,” the report said.
Overnourishment, malnutrition and waste are on the rise and increased food production may face future constraints arising from water shortages.
“We will need a new recipe to feed the world in the future,” said the report’s editor, Anders Jägerskog.
A separate report from the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) said that the best way for countries to protect millions of farmers from food insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia was to help them invest in small pumps and simple technology, rather than developing costly large-scale irrigation projects.
“We have witnessed over and over again what happens to the world’s poor, most of whom depend on agriculture for their livelihoods and already suffer from water shortages, when they are at the mercy of our fragile global food system,” said Dr. Colin Chartres, Director General.
“Farmers from all over the developing world are increasingly dependent on and benefit from small-scale water supply solutions of local interest. [These] techniques could increase yields to 300 per cent and add tens of billions of US dollars to household incomes in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.”

"The Biden government said on Saturday that it was immediately suspending Trump-era asylum agreements with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, part of an attempt to undo the hardline immigration policies of its Republican predecessor.
In a statement, the Secretary of the State Department, Antony Blinken, said that the United States “has suspended and initiated the process to end the Asylum Cooperation Agreements with the Governments of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras as the first concrete steps towards greater partnership and collaboration in the region outlined by President Biden.”
The so-called “safe third country” agreements, signed by the Trump administration and Central American nations in 2019, force asylum seekers in the region to seek refuge in those countries first before seeking asylum in the United States.
Part of Trump's controversial offer to repress illegal immigrants from Central America who constitute a large part of the migrants detained on the U.S.-Mexico border, policies were never implemented with El Salvador and Honduras, the State Department said on Saturday.
Transfers under the agreement between the United States and Guatemala have stopped since mid-March 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, the statement added.
The measures announced on Saturday came after Biden released a series of measures aimed at renewing the U.S. immigration system, including a working group to reunite separated families on the U.S.-Mexico border and another to increase an annual limit for refugees.
One of the orders requested Blinken to “consider promptly” whether it should notify the governments of the three countries that the United States intended to suspend and terminate secure agreements with third countries. It also requested the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney-General to determine whether a rule for the implementation of the agreements should be rescinded.

"The six-point peace plan for Syria proposed by Kofi Annan is doomed to failure for a simple reason: Neither President Bashar al-Assad nor the government opposition are interested in making it work.
For Al-Assad, the full implementation of the plan, which includes a political settlement through dialogue and respect for the rights of citizens to demonstrate peacefully, will put an end to his regime. From the beginning of the uprisings, his government knew that a repetition of protests in Egypt's Tahrir Square or Bahrain's Pearl Square in Damascus or Aleppo will mean a regime change. Al-Assad and his inner circle are not about to create conditions conducive to those sittings just because the Annan plan asks them to do so.
For opposition groups, Annan could devote as much time as he wants to the negotiations, but any conversation that is not based on Al-Assad's withdrawal will not be acceptable. Activists who are leading the Syrian revolution insist that the leadership of the opposition's exile has a limited mandate and that it is to discuss details for the transfer of power from the Assad family to the opposition.
The conclusion is that the two main protagonists of the conflict view the Annan plan as a means of achieving their respective mutually exclusive objectives.
By accepting the Annan plan, al-Assad follows a two-way strategy: appeases his Russian and Iranian allies, who have pressured him to accept a political solution, while working to get out of the crisis on the pretext that he faces terrorists and armed gangs.
The opposition wants the ceasefire to launch massive protests. As a Hama activist recently told me: We don't need military intervention, we don't need humanitarian corridors, we don't need safe areas. To enforce the ceasefire and millions of people will march towards the presidential palace demanding the expulsion of Assad.
After more than a year of uprisings, Syria remains trapped in a violent stalemate. Al-Assad has not been able to crush the opposition, and the opposition does not seem to be close to evicting al-Assad. Increasingly, the conflict is being framed in existential terms, and some are becoming more radicalized.
Most Alawites believe that their physical survival is at stake, because they are convinced that the death of al-Assad will lead to large-scale revenge killings. They will therefore not accept a solution that will produce a new regime in which they are not guaranteed a leading role. Similarly, opposition groups believe that if they stop now and al-Assad remains in power, he will pursue them.
In the absence of a game change that will tip the balance in favor of either side, the crisis in Syria will become a complete sectarian war that confronts the Sunnis against Alawites, which will probably spread to the neighboring countries of Iraq and Lebanon.
Although military options have been considered by the West, it is difficult to say whether that would make a difference in reversing the dynamics in the country. A military operation could cause a regional war involving Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Iran, with each country supporting its allies in Syria.
For now, Iran's Supreme Leader has strongly supported Al-Assad. A well-informed Iranian source told me that the Iranian regime will support Al-Assad no matter what happens to the end. On the other hand, Russia's policy in Syria seems to be on the move to judge by its vote in the United Nations recently. It is too early to say whether Russia will relieve Al-Assad as did Saudi Arabia in the case of Abdullah Saleh of Yemen. Russia and Iran will probably not abandon al-Assad until they are part of the negotiation process on Syria's future government.
A possible game change is whether the protest movement in Syria is widespread and covers large areas of the country.
To date, only four of Syria ' s 14 governorates constitute the main centres of the protest movement: Homs, Hama, Idlib and Daraa. While we have seen protests in other regions, they have not been as sustained and extensive as those in the four governorates. This is partly due to the state of fragmentation in the ranks of the opposition, especially among exiled groups, which do not inspire confidence among the fences.
Although large segments of sieges, including businessmen, have come to support the opposition, many remain ambivalent because they doubt that the opposition will succeed in overthrowing al-Assad. This perception is reinforced by the fact that Annan's plan does not call for al-Assad to withdraw, a detail that is not lost in the propaganda machinery of the Assad regime.
Although the opposition to exile remains divided, there are hopeful signs that the ranks of the opposition inside Syria are organizing better, training better and gaining legitimacy.
The future leaders of Syria will not come from the Syrian National Council or the National Coordination Committee for Change; they will emerge from the ranks of the revolutionary councils that are being formed in different parts of the country.
These councils bring together an eclectic mix of the most active local coordinating committees, independent activists, community and business leaders and military deserters. They are setting up an administrative infrastructure similar to a local provincial council, managing everything, from media affairs to helping families who lost their homes to provide legal assistance to imprisoned activists. They are also coordinating with each other to protect relief supply lines across their respective territories. In the process, the leaders of these councils, who come from different religious and ethnic groups in Syria, are developing political skills, cultivating local constituencies and learning through tests and mistakes in the business of governing.
In a country that is increasingly polarized along sectarian and ethnic lines, these councils may be able to provide the glue that holds the country together.
The views expressed in this commentary are only those of Randa Slim.

"Conceptual difficulties have plagued quantum mechanics since its inception, despite its extraordinary predictive successes. The basic problem, clearly said, is this: It is not entirely clear what quantum mechanics is all about. What, in fact, describes quantum mechanics?
It might seem, since it is widely agreed that any quantum mechanical system is fully described by its wave function, that quantum mechanics is fundamentally about the behavior of wave functions. Naturally, no physicist wanted this to be true more than Erwin Schrödinger, the father of wave function. However, Schrödinger finally found this impossible to believe. Their difficulty had little to do with the novelty of wave function:
That it is an abstract, unintuitive mathematical construct is a scruple that almost always arises against new aids to thought and that does not carry great message. (Schrödinger [1935] 1980: 327)
Rather, it was that the “blurring” that the extended character of wave function suggests “macroscopically affects tangible and visible things, for which the term “blurring” seems simply incorrect.”
For example, in the same document Schrödinger pointed out that it may occur in the radioactive decay that
The emergent particle is described as a spherical wave that continuously affects a surrounding luminescent screen over its full extent. The display does not, however, show a more or less constant uniform surface brightness, but rather illuminates in an instant at a point... (Schrödinger [1935] 1980: 327-328)
And he observed that one can easily fix, for example, by including a cat in the system, ""very ridiculous cases"" with
the function of the whole system that has in it the live cat and the dead one (forgive the expression) mixed or smeared in equal parts. (Schrödinger [1935] 1980: 328)
Therefore, due to the “measuring problem” of macroscopic superpositions, Schrödinger found it difficult to consider the function of the wave as “representative of reality”. But then what does he do? With obvious disapproval, Schrödinger notes that
the prevailing doctrine rescues itself or us by resorting to epistemology. We are told that no distinction should be made between the state of a natural object and what I know about it, or perhaps better, what I can know about it if I take any trouble. In reality, they say, there is only intrinsically consciousness, observation, measurement. (Schrödinger [1935] 1980: 328)
Many physicists talk about the Copenhagen interpretation, that quantum mechanics is primarily about observation or measurement results. But it is increasingly difficult to find someone who, when under pressure, defends this interpretation. It seems clear that quantum mechanics are fundamentally about atoms and electrons, quarks and strings, not those particular macroscopic regularities associated with what we call measurements of the properties of these things. But if these entities do not identify in some way with the function of the wave itself — and if talking about them is not simply a shorthand for elaborate statements about measurements — then where are they in the quantum description?
There is, perhaps, a very simple reason why it is so difficult to discern in quantum description the objects we believe quantum mechanics should describe. Perhaps quantum mechanical description is not the whole story, a possibility more prominently associated with Albert Einstein. (For a general discussion of Einstein's scientific philosophy, and in particular of his approach to conflicting positions of realism and positivism, see the entry into Einstein's philosophy of science.)
In 1935 Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen defended this possibility in their famous EPR newspaper. They concluded with this observation:
While we have thus demonstrated that wave function does not provide a complete description of physical reality, we leave open the question of whether such a description exists or not. We believe, however, that such a theory is possible. (Einstein et al. 1935: 780)",C2
"More than eight years after a Utah teenager disappeared from his room on a summer night, the man the authorities believe his kidnapping is being tried in federal court.
Brian David Mitchell, 57, is accused of abducting 14-year-old Elizabeth Smart at knifepoint from his family's house in Salt Lake City on June 5, 2002, a crime that shocked the nation and the city, which was then enjoying the glow of the 2002 Winter Olympics a few months earlier.
Mitchell faces federal charges of kidnapping and transporting a minor across state lines for inappropriate purposes. The jury selection at your trial is scheduled to begin Monday in Salt Lake City.
In the months following the disappearance of Smart, his distressed parents, Ed and Lois, became a familiar vision in the media as they continued to advocate for the safe return of their daughter.
But no one expected what happened in March 2003, when Smart was found walking down a street in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy in the company of Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Eileen Barzee. Mitchell, a vagabond, self-described prophet named Emmanuel, had done some handyman work at the Smartshome.
Utah prosecutors charged Mitchell with six counts of kidnapping, sexual assault, and robbery. But in July 2005, a Utah District Court judge declared him incompetent to be tried, leaving him in custody at Utah State Hospital.
However, the state case against Mitchell was suspended when federal authorities intervened. A grand jury in 2008 accused Mitchell and Barzee. District Judge Dale Kimball found Mitchell competent to be tried in March.
Barzee, 64, pleaded guilty in November 2009 to the kidnapping and illegal transportation of a minor in a federal court and was sentenced in May to 15 years in federal prison. He also pleaded guilty but mentally ill in the state court conspiracy to commit aggravated kidnapping in an attempt to kidnap Smart's cousin a month after Smart was kidnapped. He was given a sentence of one to 15 years, which would be served simultaneously with the federal sentence, and he was given credit for the seven years he had spent in custody.
As part of her plea agreement, Barzee agreed to cooperate in state and federal cases against her husband. However, his name does not appear on a list of witnesses presented by federal prosecutors, and it does appear on a list of witnesses presented by the defense.
Smart, her mother and younger sister, Mary Katherine -- who was sleeping in the room with Smart on the night of the kidnapping and was the only witness -- all appear on the prosecution's witness list.
Mitchell's lawyers tried to move his trial, saying it should be held outside Utah because the publicity in the case had harmed the group of potential jurors against him and jeopardized his right to a fair trial.
Kimball denied that application in August, and defense lawyers appealed his decision to the tenth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, Colorado. A panel of three appellate court judges denied the application last week, saying it was premature as the jury selection had not taken place.
A jury may be sitting where all jurors meet Mr. Mitchell's point of view on fairness, said the 10th Circuit ruling.
Defence lawyers in July stated in court documents that they intend to use a defense of insanity and the intention to present expert testimony related to an alleged illness or mental defect.
Now 22, Smart testified as part of Mitchell's competition hearing last year that after wearing her - still dressed in her red pajamas - from her house, Mitchell took her to a wooded area behind her house and performed a mock marriage ceremony with her before sexually assaulting her. She testified that he repeatedly assaulted her during her months in captivity, and that he and Barzee took her to California before returning with her to Utah.
The federal court summoned 600 jurors to fill out a preliminary jury questionnaire in the case, according to court documents. About 500 potential jurors attended the sessions on September 30 and October 1. Some were released for hardship, documents said, but some 330 members of the jury completed the questionnaire.
Kimball reduced that number to just over 200 potential jurors, according to The Salt Lake Tribune newspaper.

"We may not yet be living in an era of flying cars, as predicted in the 1985 movie Back to the Future II, but the emergence of smart phones and other new technologies is creating a reality that could be said to be so exciting and almost so crazy. Experts agree that economic and demographic changes, technological advances and environmental concerns are fundamentally altering the transport landscape. “It’s a very dynamic time,” said Robert Puentes of the think-tank of Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program. “There is an approach to a closer connection between the role of transport and the economic health of cities and their impact on people.”
As the average U.S. travel lengthens And the country's infrastructure is aging badly, cities across the United States are forced to redefine what transport is. Increasingly, urban planners, transport experts and scientists are realizing that old self-centered models focused on alleviating traffic congestion are not enough to address issues such as population growth and carbon emissions, and transport is now, more than ever, an integral component of a city's larger sustainability efforts.
Large American cities like Los Angeles, Seattle and Chicago are working to make better use of their streets by adding more bus lanes, increasing pedestrian walkways and expanding their rail options, while at the same time working with the private sector on advanced technologies that will allow a vehicle to drive and communicate with other vehicles and their surroundings, essentially by making transportation intelligent. “The most sustainable places to live are those with multimodal transport systems,” Puentes said. “You can’t be a global competitive city if you don’t have a robust transport network.”
Here are three of the key trends that experts predict will shape the transport industry in the coming years.
Increased travel delivery services like Uber and Lyft, essentially reserved taxis with the click of a smartphone button, and apps like Waze, which uses real-time traffic data to find the fastest routes for drivers, are drastically changing the way people move and affecting the way traffic moves across a city. Communication between drivers and drivers, between different vehicles and between cars and infrastructure is taking transport to a new era, according to Allan Clelland, an expert in transport technology.
According to a recent study by the UCLA Institute of Transport Studies, vehicle travel has declined among millennials – people born approximately between the early 1980s and early 2000s – compared to previous generations. According to the study, those born in the 1990s are making 4% fewer car trips and traveling 18% less miles per year, on average, than members of previous generations at the same stage of their lives.
Meanwhile, those who still drive cars are dealing with less traffic thanks to Waze. Experts say that the traffic application has eased congestion on highways and reduced driver travel times, but it has also led to a problematic increase in cars moving through residential neighborhoods. This has enraged residents, who claim that the increase in traffic on their quiet streets reduces their quality of life.
This trend could continue as vehicle-to-vehicle data communication grows, as well as communication between vehicles and surrounding infrastructure. Currently, a traffic light can detect when a car is approaching, but that's it. Companies are working to develop technology that allows a vehicle to tell traffic control systems not only that it is present, but also where it is going and how fast it travels.
Driverless cars have been on the headlines since Google started testing vehicles in 2012 but no one really knows when driverless cars will become commonplace. However, partial automation of cars is already underway. Alexandre Bayen of the University of California expects automation to advance in stages: first, there could be automated buses with their own lanes, then maybe trucks in ports or mining cities: essentially, vehicles that are connected electronically and travel in a single archive.
The idea of a fully automated transport system is intriguing because it has the potential to improve safety by eliminating human errors and increasing the efficiency of car owners, who can go on with other tasks during a long journey. It can also help reduce carbon emissions and traffic congestion and allow more people to access cars. But, even if the driverless technology were ready to go on the roads now, it would take a long time to get fully automated since the average age of cars on the road is 11.5 years.
To see how cars can be without driver in action, go to the video at: vimeo.com/37751380.
As the world runs to prevent catastrophic climate change, and countries, states and cities work to achieve ambitious emissions targets, these policies could also have a major impact on the future of transport, stimulating everything, from zero-emission and low-emission vehicles to applications that encourage more walking, cycling and car sharing.
Sharon Feigon, Executive Director of the Shared Use Mobility Center, foresees a future where a person can use a transit pass that gives him access to numerous modes of transport on a given day. If your train is delayed, for example, you can access a city bike, take a ferry or rent a car through a shared car program using the same pass. “We’re going to see these systems packaged together and make it as easy as possible to connect them to each other so that people can seamlessly transfer between them,” he said.
When considering the future of transportation, it is also important to consider why people travel: they can go to work, meet friends or family, or do shopping. Technologies and trends that reduce the need for such travel – e.g. virtual meetings or teleworking – could also have a major impact on transport.
There was a time when the idea of a flying car represented the height of innovation, but the technologies that are now imagined and developed could be considered even more sophisticated and useful in dealing with the social and environmental threats we face in the coming decades.”

"I will refer to the mark of knowledge that Descartes seeks in Meditations, as ‘perfect knowledge’. Famously, he defines perfect knowledge in terms of doubt. While he distinguishes lower degrees of conviction, and perfect knowledge, he writes:
I disagree as follows: there is conviction [persuasion] when there is some reason left that can lead us to doubt, but knowledge [scientia] is conviction based on a reason so strong that it can never be shaken for any stronger reason. (24 May 1640, letter to Regius, AT 3:65, CSMK 147)
In the Second Answers, he adds:
Now I will explain for the second time the basis on which it seems to me that all human certainty can be founded.
First, as soon as we think we perceive something correctly, we are spontaneously convinced that it is true. Now, if this conviction is so firm that it is impossible for us to have any reason to doubt what we are convinced of, then there are no further questions to ask: we have everything we could reasonably wish for. ... For the assumption we are making here is of such a firm conviction that it is absolutely incapable of being destroyed; and such conviction is clearly the same as the most perfect certainty. (AT 7:144f, CSM 2:103)
These passages (and others) suggest a story where doubt is the contrast of certainty. As my certainty increases, my doubt diminishes; conversely, as my doubt increases, my certainty diminishes. The requirement that knowledge be based on complete, or perfect, certainty is therefore equivalent to requiring a total inability to doubt one’s convictions – an absolute indubitability. This conception of the relationship between certainty and doubt helps underwrite Descartes' methodical emphasis on doubt, the so-called ""method of doubt"" (discussed in section 2).
That perfect knowledge requires that it is “impossible for us to have any reason to doubt what we are convinced of” marks an extraordinarily high standard of justification. Is this the only standard that deserves to talk about knowledge? This is a difficult question to answer, because Descartes did not write in English. But it could be said that it is a contextualistic epistemic, at least in the sense of invoking the notion of knowledge in divergent contexts that presuppose different epistemic standards. We will see, for example, that he argues that even deductive demonstrations of expert geometers do not meet the standards necessary for perfect knowledge; however, the type of terminology he uses to characterize his epistemic achievements is routinely translated in terms of speaking-knowledge, into standard English translations of his work.
The certainty/inubitability of interest to Descartes is psychological, but not merely psychological – not simply an inexplicable feeling. It also has a distinctive epistemic character, which implies a kind of rational insight. During moments of certainty, it is as if my perception was guided by “a great light in the intellect” (Med. 4, 7:59, CSM 2:41). This rational enlightenment enables me to “see with total clarity with the eye of my mind”; my feelings of certainty are grounded – in fact, “I see a manifest contradiction” by denying the proposition of which I am convinced.",C2
"Young children are much more likely to experience attention and hyperactivity problems if their mother develops diabetes during pregnancy and is born in a poor or low-middle-class home, suggests a new study.
The study, published this week in the Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine Archives, found that children whose mothers received a diagnosis of diabetes during pregnancy - LRB- known as gestational diabetes -RRB- were twice as likely as their peers to meet the criteria for hyperactivity attention deficit disorder - LRB- ADHD -RRB- at age six.
Living in a family with less than average socioeconomic status also doubled the risk of ADHD in six-year-olds. However, children with both risk factors -- those who were exposed to gestational diabetes and grew up in a less than tributary household -- had a 14-fold higher risk of ADHD compared to children without either risk factor.
Health.com: What Causes ADHD? 12 myths and facts
Findings do not show that gestational diabetes causes ADHD directly, but researchers say they send a message to mothers and doctors that gestational diabetes can pose hidden dangers for a child long after birth, especially if the child grows up in a difficult environment.
Mothers should be aware that gestational diabetes can affect their fetus, says Yoko Nomura, Ph.D., lead author of the study and assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York.
Gestational diabetes, which affects about 5% of pregnant women in the United States, usually develops during the second or third trimester of pregnancy, the same window of time in which a fetus undergoes a critical burst of brain development.
Health.com: Tips for Healthy Pregnancy with Diabetes
Women with gestational diabetes have an abnormally high level of blood sugar - LRB-glucose -RRB-. If the fetus is bombarded with excess blood sugar, the energy normally used for the development of the nervous system could be potentially diverted to absorb that excess, Nomura says. As a result, the central nervous system may not develop properly.
Growing up in poverty would probably aggravate any underlying deficits in the nervous system, Nomura says.
When babies are born in households of higher socioeconomic status, they have better access to health care - LSB- and -RSB- corrective activities, the intellectual stimulus is greater, they have better food, he says.
In addition, low-income women may not control their gestational diabetes, as well as the more prosperous future mothers, says Luigi Garibaldi, M.D., clinical director of pediatric endocrinology at Pittsburgh Children's Hospital.
Having diabetes during pregnancy alone may not be so bad, but if you don't take care of it, there may be consequences for the child's brain development, says Garibaldi, who didn't participate in the study.

Nomura and her colleagues followed 212 children of various ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds living in Queens, New York, 10 per cent of whom were exposed to gestational diabetes. From preschool to six years of age, a trained psychologist or doctoral student evaluated each child annually the symptoms of ADHD.
The study had several shortcomings. It was relatively small, and although they did take into account the history of ADHD parents, the researchers did not collect data on whether children had siblings or other relatives with attention problems or hyperactivity. In addition, Garibaldi says, researchers did not measure how well mothers controlled their gestational diabetes.
However, the study is a valuable reminder that a child's environment, both inside and outside the uterus, seems to affect the risk of ADHD, says Joel Nigg, Ph.D., professor of psychiatry at Oregon University of Health and Science, Portland.
Health.com: ADHD linked to pesticide exposure
Previous research suggests, for example, that children are at higher risk for ADHD if they are exposed to lead and certain pesticides.
As a precaution, we could add -LSB- gestational diabetes -RSB- to the list of risk factors we know, says Negro, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study.

"A verb is transitive if and only if it usually occurs with a direct object, and in such occurrences it is said to occur transiently. Thus ‘te’ occurs transiently in ‘I ate the meat and left the vegetables’, but not in ‘I ate then to the left’ (maybe it is not the same verb ‘left’ in these two examples, but it seems to be the same ‘te’). A verb is intensible if the verb (VP) that is formed with its complement is anomalous in at least one of three ways: (i) replace one expression with another that is choreferential with it in the verb complement can change the truth value of the phrase in which the VP is produced – for example, Mark Twain can be admired but not Samuel Clemens, without realizing that his annoying neighbor Sam is the famous writer (in this case, the replacement of the reference ‘Samuel Clemens’ with ‘Mark Twain’ in the VP ‘admire Mark Twain’ will convert a true phrase, ‘you will look at Mark Twain’ in a false one, ‘you will admire Samuel Clemens’); (ii) the VP admits a special ‘unspecific’ reading if it contains a quantifier, or a certain type of quantifier (example of Quine’ (1956:185) is famous: it observes that if we want a special reading ‘inspecific’ as (specified) as an example, but it does not want to be.
The intense phenomena are disconcerting, and it is worth studying, because (a) it seems that the only way to account for the abilities of language speakers to produce and understand phrases from their native languages that they have never before found is to propose a compositional structure in language and an interpretative capacity in the speakers who exploit it. But (b) simpler ideas about what such a structure is like cannot accommodate intensity. So we want to know what is the smallest complication that allows intensification. The investigation of intentional verbs has focused mainly on verbs used to make reports of propositional attitude. These verbs take clauses instead of direct objects as their complements. However, as we will see below, the Intentional transitory verbs (hereinafter referred to as ITVs) are not limited to duplicating the problems posed by the propositional attitude verbs, but introduce special difficulties of their own.",C2
"Why should philosophy be interested in what appears to be a purely linguistic notion? Because, especially in the first half of the 20th century, many philosophers thought that it could do a crucial epistemological work, providing an account, first, of our seemingly a priori knowledge of mathematics, and then — with a little help from British empiricism — of our understanding of claims about the space-time world as well. In fact, ""conceptual analysis"" soon became the same way that English-speaking philosophers particularly characterized their work.
Many also thought that he would carry out the metaphysical work of explaining the truth and necessity of mathematics, showing not only how we could know about these subjects regardless of experience, but how they could be true in this and all possible worlds. This latter ambition was sometimes not distinguished from the former, although it is no longer shared by most philosophers still interested in analysis. In fact, many have wondered how a prayer could be true, much less necessary, “only by virtue of the meaning”, for surely the truth of any prayer depends on the world being the way in which prayer represents it as being. Let us remember that Frege's ambition was to reduce mathematics to logic by showing how, replacing synonyms with synonyms, each mathematical truth could be shown to be logical. He did not go on to affirm (although some later philosophers did) that logical truths in themselves were true only by virtue of meaning. Therefore, ""Bachelors are single"" could be shown to be analytical by replacing ""unmarried men"" with ""bachelors"" and thus converting ""unmarried men are single"" to the logical truth. But what does this last truth do? As Devitt (1996) noted:[1]
It is partly true by virtue of what it means and partly by virtue of the way the world is, by virtue of the fact that all singles are single. ... [Such phrases] are true by virtue of the meaning given the logical truths (1996, p. 22)
In view of this, in the rest of this post we will focus mainly on the epistemological project.",C2
"Low-income countries will remain on the front line of human-induced climate change over the next century, experiencing gradual sea-level increases, stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rains and longer and larger heat waves, according to the most comprehensive assessment of the problem.
The last major United Nations (UN) assessment in 2007 predicted uncontrolled temperature increases of 6°C or more by the end of the century. Now it is believed that this is unlikely for scientists, but average temperatures of land and sea are expected to continue to rise throughout this century, possibly reaching 4°C above current levels, sufficiently to devastate crops and make life in many cities unbearably hot.
According to the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), published in Stockholm and published online in September, as temperatures rise and hot, tropical and subtropical ocean regions face strong changes in annual rainfall.
East Africa can expect to experience an increase in short rains, while West Africa should expect heavier monsoons. Burma, Bangladesh and India can expect stronger cyclones; elsewhere in South Asia, more intense summer rains are expected. Indonesia may receive less rain between July and October, but coastal regions around the South China Sea and the Gulf of Thailand may expect greater extreme rain when cyclones hit land.
“It is almost certain that, in the long term, global rainfall will change. High latitude countries, such as Europe or North America, are expected to receive more rainfall, but many arid and semi-arid subtropical regions are likely to experience less rainfall. In humid tropical regions, extreme precipitation events are likely to be more intense and more frequent in a warmer world,” said the authors of the report.
They added: “The monsoon start dates are likely to be earlier or not to change much, while monsoon withdrawal rates are likely to be delayed, leading to an extension of the season.”
Scientists from developing countries and commentators have welcomed the report, which they said supported their own observations.
“The IPCC argues that climate change is real and is happening much stronger than before. We are already seeing the effects of climate change in Bangladesh and throughout South Asia. It's not news to us. Most developing countries now face climate change. They don’t need the IPCC to tell them that the climate is changing,” said Saleemul Huq, director of the Dhaka-based International Center for Climate Change and Development.
Scientists have also reduced projections of sea level rise. Depending on future greenhouse gas emissions, sea level will increase by an average of 40 to 62 cm by 2100. However, there will be significant geographical variations; many millions of people living in the big cities of the developing world, including Lagos and Calcutta, are threatened.
Weather disasters are also more likely in a warmer world, the report suggests. Although the global frequency of tropical cyclones is expected to decrease or remain essentially unchanged, they may be more intense, with stronger winds and stronger rains.
Life in many cities in developing countries could become virtually unbearable, as urban temperatures are already well above those in the surrounding countryside. Much higher temperatures could reduce the duration of the growth period in some parts of Africa by up to 20 per cent, the report said.
Dr. Camilla Toulmin, Director of the International Institute for Environment and Development, says: “Climate models are not yet robust enough to predict impacts at the local and regional levels, but it is clear that everyone is vulnerable in some way.”
Oxfam predicted that global hunger would worsen as climate change inevitably damaged crop production and disrupted incomes. They suggested that the number of people at risk of hunger could increase by 10 to 20 per cent by 2050, and that the daily availability of calories per inhabitant would decrease worldwide.
“Climate change is already jeopardizing achievements in the fight against hunger, and it seems to be getting worse,” Oxfam said. “A hot world is a hungry world. If the rest of the 21st century develops as its first decade, we will soon experience extreme weather far beyond the limits of human experience.”

"Many philosophers recognize a distinction between two types of mental events. (A) The first goes by many names, for example, phenomenal experiences, occurrences of qualitative consciousness, what-is-like experience, qualia. Pains, later images, and tastes can serve as examples. (B) Mental events of the second type are propositional attitudes that occur, for example, beliefs and desires (occurring). Arguments about epiphenomenalism can refer to any of the types of mental events, and it should not be assumed that a given argument for one type can be reformulated without loss to the other. However, the two types can often be connected through beliefs that one has their own experiences. Thus, if it is held that pains have no physical effects, then one should say that (i) pains do not cause beliefs that one is in pain, or (ii) beliefs that one is in pain are epiphenomenal. Because, if the pains caused beliefs that one is in pain, and the latter had physical effects, then the pains, after all, would have effects on the physical world (though indirectly). But epiphenomenalism says that mental events have no effect on the physical world. [1]
The central motivation for epiphenomenalism lies in the premise that whenever there is a sufficient cause of a physical event, there is a sufficient physical cause of that event. If a mental event is more than a physical event, then for it to make any causal contribution of its own in the physical world would require a violation of physical law. The interactionist model of Descartes (1649) proposed that non-physical events could cause small changes in the shape of the pineal gland. But such non-physical effects, however mild, would mean that the physical account of the movement is false, because that account says there will be no such change in form unless there is a physical force to cause it.
One can try to rescue mental efficacy by assuming that whenever there is a mental effect on the physical world there is also a physical force that is a sufficient cause of the effect. This view, however, offends the Occamist principles and does not satisfy the main anti-epifenomenalist intuition, namely, that the mental makes a difference to the physical, that is, that it leads to a behavior that would not have occurred in the absence of the mental. Vision also leads to an epistemological problem: If there is always a sufficient physical cause for what a mental event is supposed to produce, then one could never be in a position where one needs to assume that there is something non-physical at work, and therefore there could never be any reason to introduce mental causes into their account of neuronal events or behavior.
Many contemporary thinkers would respond to the central motivation for epiphenomenalism by denying its dualistic presupposition, i.e., by arguing that mental events are identical to physical events, and thus may have physical effects. Section 3 will explain the questions left over by such physicologistic views. For the time being, it should be noted that the argument set out in the two preceding paragraphs is not supposed to be an argument for dualism, but only for epiphenomenalism, once dualism is accepted.
The additional support for epiphenomenalism can be derived from the fact, pointed out by Wilhelm Wundt (1912), that “each simple sensation joins a very complicated combination of peripheral processes and the central nerve”, along with the fact that the causes of behavior are also complex neural events. This latter fact makes it natural to look for complex events along the causal chain that lead to behavior; and these can be found in neural events that are required for the occurrence of simple sensations. Sensations themselves could not contribute to behavior without first having more complex neural effects than themselves. Thus, an anti-epifenomenalist posture would require us to prefer the hypothesis that simple sensations cause (relatively) complex neural events over the hypothesis that complex neural events (which are required in any case for the causation of sensations) are adequate to cause the neural events required for the causation of behavior.

"Thanksgiving is a party held predominantly in North America, and has a different meaning in each of the countries where it is recognized.
In the United States, Thanksgiving is a federal holiday (that is, all government employees and most private employees receive a day off from work), and it always takes place on the fourth Thursday of November, regardless of the date.
The feast means the immense progress made by pilgrims, or some of the first travelers to North America, in Plymouth Plantation circa 1621. It was at this time that the hungry and tired pilgrims were taught (by Native Americans) how to grow and produce food on the unique terrain of North America. Once they had cultivated (and captured) an abundance of food, the pilgrims were gratefully awaited, and celebrated alongside the Native Americans who provided such valuable help. President Abraham Lincoln began the contemporary Thanksgiving practice by calling a ""Thanks Day"" during one of his Civil War speeches.
In America today, Thanksgiving remains firmly rooted in its historical roots, and is widely regarded as a day to give thanks for good food, good times and family. Thanksgiving dinner usually consists of turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffed, vegetables, sauce and large desserts. Without a doubt, giving in abundance is a cornerstone of the feast, as doing so could only be possible if one possesses abundance.",C2
"An American man has been arrested in North Korea, two State Department officials told CNN.
Diplomatic sources speaking on condition of not being identified said the man is a Korean-American businessman. One of the sources said the businessman had a visa to enter North Korea.
The State Department is working with the Swedish Embassy in the capital of North Korea, Pyongyang, officials said. The United States urges the North Korean authorities, through the Swedes, to release man for humanitarian reasons.
Sweden represents the interests of the United States in North Korea because the United States and North Korea have no diplomatic relations.
The Swedes have had consular access to the man and have visited him, officials said. The Swedes are asking for regular visits, officials said.
A Swedish official in Stockholm confirmed to CNN that the embassy in Pyongyang is working on the case.
Sources refused to provide additional information due to privacy issues.
North Korea has detained several Americans in recent years, increasing levels of tension in what is already a rocky relationship between Pyongyang and Washington.
In 2010, former President Jimmy Carter helped secure the release of Aijalon Mahli Gomes, an American citizen who had been fined approximately $600,000 and sentenced to eight years of hard labour for crossing the Chinese border into North Korea.
Gomes, who attempted suicide while in custody of North Korea, was believed to be a Christian activist.
Two American journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, who had entered North Korea in March 2009 and had been arrested and sentenced to 12 years of hard labour, were released in August 2009 following an intervention by former President Bill Clinton.
Tensions between North and West Korea have increased in recent years due in part to concerns about Pyongyang's nuclear development agenda. The United States and South Korea conducted joint military exercises in February, despite North to South Korea's warning not to conduct the exercises, calling them provocation and threatening to wrap Seoul in a sea of flames.
South Korea accuses North of torpedoing and sinking one of its warships in March 2010, killing 46 sailors, and last November North Korea bombed Yeonpyeong Island, killing two marines and two South Korean civilians.

"CNN reported Monday on the heartbreaking story of Emily Bauer, a Houston teenager, who suffered a debilitating stroke after consuming what has become known as synthetic marijuana.
Although the role that synthetic marijuana played in Emily's medical condition is still unclear, what is clear is that these new chemicals could not even exist if it weren't for the ban on marijuana, a plant that has been widely consumed worldwide for thousands of years. A few years ago, people started using synthetic marijuana to evade drug testing, and they realized, once news reports spread their existence.
And even though President Obama and 41 governors have signed legislation criminalizing various forms of synthetic marijuana, this is not going to go away, that is, until we legally regulate marijuana itself.
To understand the use of drugs by adolescents, we must recognize that they have grown up with drugs everywhere. We urge young people to be drug free, but Americans are bombarded with messages that encourage us to absorb and medicate with a variety of substances: We use caffeine to increase our energy, drink alcohol to relax, and use prescription and over-the-counter drugs to help us work, study, and sleep. And despite the draconian punishments associated with illegal drugs, 44% of today's teenagers will test them before graduating from high school.
Marijuana itself is the most widely used illegal drug -- over 100 million Americans have used it and 20 million have been arrested by it since 1965.
It is not surprising that, given the laws of supply and demand, enterprising chemists have discovered a host of marijuana-like chemicals that can be sprayed on plant matter similar to potpourri and sold as incense. People who have tried synthetic marijuana often report psychoactive effects comparable to marijuana, but noticeably less pleasurable.
Almost no one would touch this synthetic matter -- actually, it wouldn't even exist -- except for the criminalization of the marijuana plant itself. Trying to ban one substance after another is like a nut game: every time one is banned, another untested and potentially more dangerous drug appears to replace it.
The synthetic marijuana Emily Bauer consumed was probably one of the second generation of synthetic marijuana chemicals. Since Congress and state legislatures banned a large number of them in the last two years, companies that produce these products have simply changed their chemical formulations to one of thousands of slightly different chemicals with marijuana-like effects.
These new synthetic marijuana products are not an example of effective legal regulation, but an example of sub-regulation. Like aspirin or soft drinks, they are not subject to age, leave, or other restrictions.
Interestingly, the rush to criminalize synthetic marijuana and other synthetic drugs comes at a time when public opinion is dramatically changing in favor of decriminalizing, and even legally regulating, marijuana.
More than three quarters of U.S. voters believe marijuana should be decriminalized, which has been done by 14 states. They also believe it should be available for medical use, that 18 states and the District of Columbia now allow it; and about half think it should be legally regulated more or less like alcohol, as Colorado and Washington are doing. After decades of ban on marijuana, elected officials and the public are finally realizing that regulating the production and sale of marijuana is the best way to reduce the damage of the illicit marijuana market and the damage of marijuana use itself.
It is important to note that the overwhelmingly approved marijuana legalization initiatives in Colorado and Washington last November create strictly regulated regimes - with age restrictions - LRB- 21 or older -RRB- accompanied by meticulous government oversight of retail producers and distributors. On the other hand, synthetic marijuana, either insufficiently regulated or totally prohibited, has never been subject to an adequate level of regulation.
Before rushing to criminalize a new drug, legislators should ask: What specific regulatory options would help reduce harm to individuals, families, and society? We need to ask ourselves how best to solve the problem -- how to reduce drug abuse and addiction -- and use the best evidence to guide us.
And the evidence clearly shows that effective legal regulation reduces drug harm better than prohibition. We have already learned a lot from the regulation of other substances, such as alcohol and tobacco. It has been shown that labelling requirements for products, as well as restrictions on marketing, branding and retailing, reduce young people's access to tobacco products and drive tobacco purchases.
Tobacco has contributed to more deaths than combined alcohol and illicit drugs. As a result of educational initiatives and restrictions on marketing and age, smoking has declined dramatically over time, despite its legality for adults, in one of the greatest public health successes of the last generation.
Direct criminalization only drives the demand for drugs to the illicit market. Under prohibition, regulators have no control over where the product is sold, who sells it, or who sells it. In addition, the detention of young people often causes more harm than the use of drugs in itself.
After 40 years of the war on drugs, evidence clearly shows that it is ineffective to use the criminal justice system to send public health messages. The ban simply creates new public health problems and maximizes the harm associated with the use of illegal drugs.
In fact, drugs, whether marijuana or synthetic marijuana, should not be regulated legally because they are safe; they should be regulated legally precisely because they can be harmful.

"It has been a common view among political philosophers that there is a special relationship between moral goodness and legitimate authority. Many authors (especially those who composed Prince's mirror books or royal council books during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance) believed that the use of political power was legitimate only if it was exercised by a ruler whose personal moral character was strictly virtuous. Thus, the rulers were advised that if they wanted to succeed — that is, if they wanted a long and peaceful reign and wanted to pass their office to their descendants — they should be sure to behave in accordance with conventional standards of ethical kindness. In a sense, it was thought that the rulers did well when doing good; they earned the right to be obeyed and respected insofar as they showed themselves to be virtuous and morally upright (see Briggs and Nederman nearby).
Machiavelli thoroughly criticizes precisely this moralistic view of authority in his best known treatise, The Prince. For Machiavelli, there is no moral basis for judging the difference between the legitimate and illegitimate uses of power. Rather, authority and power are essentially coequal: whoever has power has the right to command; but goodness does not guarantee power and the good person has no more authority by virtue of being good. Thus, in direct opposition to a moralist theory of politics, Machiavelli says that the only real concern of the political ruler is the acquisition and maintenance of power (although he speaks less of power per se than of “maintaining the state”). In this sense, Machiavelli presents an atrocious criticism of the concept of authority, arguing that the notion of legitimate rights of rulership adds nothing to the actual possession of power. The Prince intends to reflect the self-conscious political realism of an author who is fully aware — on the basis of direct experience with the Florentine government — that goodness and law are not enough to win and maintain a political office. Machiavelli thus seeks to learn and teach the rules of political power. For Machiavelli, power characteristically defines political activity, and therefore it is necessary for any successful ruler to know how to use power. Machiavelli believes that only through the correct application of power can individuals be led to obey and the ruler will be able to keep the state secure.
Machiavelli's political theory, then, represents a concerted effort to exclude questions of authority and legitimacy from consideration in the discussion of political decision-making and political judgment. Nowhere does this come out more clearly than in their treatment of the relationship between law and force. Machiavelli recognizes that good laws and good weapons are the dual basis of a well-ordered political system. But he immediately adds that since coercion creates legality, he will focus his attention on force. It says: “Since there can be no good laws without good weapons, I will not consider the laws, but I will speak of weapons” (Prince CW 47). In other words, the legitimacy of the law is based entirely on the threat of coercive force; authority is impossible for Machiavelli as a right apart from power to enforce it. Consequently, Machiavelli concludes that fear is always preferable to affection in subjects, as violence and deception are superior to legality in order to effectively control them. Machiavelli observes that
This can be said in general of men: they are ungrateful, disloyal, insincere and deceitful, shy of danger and avid for gain....Love is a bond of obligation that these miserable creatures break when it suits them to do so; but fear holds them firm for a fear of punishment that never happens. (Prince CW 62; revised translation)
As a result, Machiavelli cannot really be said to have a theory of the obligation separate from the imposition of power; people obey only because they fear the consequences of not doing so, whether it is the loss of life or privileges. And, of course, power alone cannot bind one, to the extent that the obligation assumes that one cannot do anything else in a meaningful way.
Concomitantly, a Machiavellian perspective directly attacks the notion of any foundation for authority independent of pure possession of power. For Machiavelli, people are obliged to obey purely in deference to the higher power of the state. If I think I should not obey a particular law, what eventually leads me to submit to that law will be either a fear of the power of the state or the actual exercise of that power. It is the power that is ultimately necessary for the application of contradictory views of what I must do; I can only choose not to obey if I possess the power to resist the demands of the State or if I am willing to accept the consequences of the superiority of the State of coercive force. Machiavelli's argument in The Prince is designed to demonstrate that politics can only be consistently defined in terms of supremacy of coercive power; authority as a right to command has no independent status. He maintains this statement by referring to the observable realities of political affairs and public life, as well as arguments that reveal the selfish nature of all human conduct. For Machiavelli it makes no sense and it is useless to speak of any claim of authority and the right to command that is separated from the possession of the higher political power. The ruler who lives alone for his rights will surely wither and die for those same rights, because in the harsh and tumultuous political conflict those who prefer power to authority are more likely to succeed. Without exception, the authority of states and their laws will never be recognized when they are not supported by a demonstration of power that makes obedience inescapable. The methods of achieving obedience are varied, and depend to a large extent on the foresight exercised by the prince. Therefore, the successful ruler needs special training.",C2
"Like most contemporary counterfactual theories, Lewis' theory employs a possible world semantics for counterfactuals. Such semantics establishes conditions of truth for counterfactuals in terms of similarities between possible worlds. Lewis advocates realism over the possible worlds, according to which the possible non-real worlds are real concrete entities at the same time as the present world (Lewis 1986e). However, most contemporary philosophers would try to display the framework of explanatoryly fruitful possible worlds, while distanced themselves from full realism over possible worlds (see entry into possible worlds).
The central notion of a possible global semantics for counterfactuals is a relation of comparative similarity between worlds (Lewis 1973a). It is said that one world is closer to the present than another if the former is more like the real world than the latter. In terms of this similarity relationship, the condition of truth for the counterfactual “If A (or had been) the case, C would be (or had been) the case” is stated as follows:
(1)
“If A were the case, C would be the case” is true in the real world if and only if (i) there are no possible A-worlds; or (ii) some A-world where C has closer to the real world than any A-world where C does not have.
We will ignore the first case in which the counterfactual is vaguely true. The fundamental idea of this analysis is that the counterfactual “If A were the case, C would be the case” is true only if it takes less than a deviation from the present to make the background true together with the consequence than to make the previous true without the consequent.
In terms of counterfactuals, Lewis defines a notion of causal dependence between events, which plays a central role in his theory of causality (1973b).
(2)
When c and e are two different possible events, and causally depends on c if and only if, if c would occur and occur; and if c would not occur and would not occur.
This condition states that whether or not e occurs depends on whether or not c occurs. Where c and e are events that really happen, this condition of truth can be simplified a little. Because in this case it is deduced from the second formal condition on the relation of comparative similarity that the counterfactual “If c would occur and happen” is automatically true: this formal condition implies that a counterfactual with true antecedent and true consequence is in itself true. Consequently, the true condition for causal dependence becomes:
(3)
Where c and e are two distinct real events, and it depends causally on c if and only if, if c did not occur and would not occur.
There are three important things to point out about the definition of causal dependence. First, it takes the primary relationship of causal dependence to be events. Lewis' own theory of events (1986b) constructs events as classes of possible time-space regions. However, different conceptions of events are compatible with the basic definition (Kim 1973a; for an alternative in general Lewisian assume the events see McDonnell 2016 and Kaiserman 2017). Indeed, it even seems possible to formulate it in terms of facts and not events (Mellor 1995, 2004).
Secondly, the definition requires that causally dependent events be distinct from each other. Distinction means that events are not identical, neither is it part of the other, nor does it imply the other. This rating is important if false non-causal dependencies are discarded. (For this point, see Kim 1973b and Lewis 1986b.) Because although you wouldn’t have written ‘Larry’ if you hadn’t written ‘rr’, and you wouldn’t have said ‘hello’ aloud if you hadn’t said ‘hello’, neither does dependency count as a causal dependence, as the paired events are no different from each other in the required sense.
Convinced of the need to leave room in his analysis for causation by (and) absence – as when the gardener's failure to water the plants causes his death – Lewis subsequently changed his opinion to the view that causal dependence is a matter of counterfactual dependence between events or their absences (Lewis 2000: §X; 2004b). We will largely ignore this complication in what follows: for some discussion of causality by absence see Schaffer 2000b, Beebee 2004b, McGrath 2005, Livengood and Machery 2007, Dowe 2009.
Thirdly, the counterfactuals used in the analysis should be understood according to what Lewis calls the standard interpretation. There are several possible ways of interpreting counterfactuals; and some interpretations give rise to false non-causional dependencies between events. For example, suppose that events c and e are effects of a common cause d. It is tempting to reason that there must be a causal dependence between c and e participating in the following piece of counterfactual reasoning: if c had not occurred, then d would not have occurred; and if d had not occurred, and would not have occurred. But Lewis says that the old counterfactual, which he calls a counterfactual of retrogression, should not be used in the evaluation of causal dependence. The correct counterfactuals to be used are unretroduced counterfactuals that typically keep the past fixed to the time (or just before the time) in which the background of the counterfactual is supposed to obtain. So if c hadn't happened, d – which actually happened before c – would have happened anyway; so in the standard interpretation, where the counterfactuals of recoil are false, the inference to the assertion that e causally depends on c is blocked.

"The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of marriage equality this week. Marriage is an institution intended for two people who love each other, who want to commit to the union for life as a couple, and to form a family, either only the two of them, or also includes children.
The traditional concept of marriage has evolved over time. In recent history, it has been defined by most religions, and states, as a man and a woman. However, there are millions of human beings whose composition is such that they are attracted to the same gender and share the universal human desire to bond with a mate for life. They're gay.
In 2013, the vast majority of Americans have gone beyond prejudice towards gays and lesbians. Homosexual couples and their families have lived openly in our communities for more than 30 years, and we now know them as neighbors, family and friends. In the course of living their daily lives, raising families and contributing to society, we have come to see that American gays and lesbians share the same hopes and dreams as everyone else.
However, for decades, we have had a political debate about opposite gender vs. gender marriages that has created a constant stream of agitation. What many public figures have known to be true about gay people in their personal lives has been -- until recently -- unacceptable to openly recognize in the political arena. In recent years, however, public opinion has driven our political conversation dramatically. Four out of five young voters, of all denominations and political parties, support marriage equality, and even those who continue to oppose the marriage rights of same-sex couples can see that it is inevitable.
The problem is that despite the fact that public opinion has reached a historic peak in marriage equality, the old laws that discriminate against American gays and lesbians have remained in the books, wounding gay couples and their families. Congress passed a law -- the Defense of Marriage Act or DOMA -- that prohibited the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriage, although this is a constitutionally agreed matter for most states to decide. And that's the mistake the Supreme Court corrected this week.
The court found DOMA unconstitutional, and also allowed same-sex couples to return to California.
In writing for the majority, Judge Anthony Kennedy ruled that restricting marriage to opposite-sex couples forces same-sex couples to live as married for the purpose of state law but unmarried for the purpose of federal law, thereby diminishing the stability and predictability of basic personal relationships that the state has found appropriate to recognize and protect.
Kennedy also said that the law unfairly treated the 220,000 children of same-sex couples in the United States differently from the children of parents of the opposite sex -- which we should all agree is hard, unnecessary, and unfair. Ensuring that all children can grow up with the same federal benefits and protections as their parents offer is crucial, and Kennedy rightly saw the impact of not only making marriages equal to federal purposes, but also making their families equal.
Marriage is an institution that provides stability to society and the family. By quashing DOMA and dismissing the California Proposition 8 appeal, the Supreme Court has forged a bipartisan consensus that marriage is an institution important enough to apply to human beings equally, regardless of gender. It is important to note that the court also strengthened the basis on which advocates and officials will one day achieve marriage equality throughout the country.

1 INTRODUCTION
In the standard paradigm for the formation of structures in the Universe, the
Cosmological Cold Dark Matter (MDL) Model, Small Dark Matter
(DM) Haloes form early through gravitational collapse, and then
merge to form larger structures later. At the same time,
barionic gas cools within the haloes on a certain mass scale, turning on
galaxy formation. As a result, the hierarchy of galaxies observed
is formed (e.g. White & Rees 1978; Frenk & White 2012), i.e.
smaller DM subhaloes and associated satellite galaxies in orbit
within larger host systems consisting of a DM host halo and a
Central galaxy. In this article, we consider the orbital evolution of
subhaloes in their host halo, given the history of the mass assembly of the

The orbital parameters of the subhalos are essential to determine their spatial distribution and their mass loss rates, and therefore are

"The massive collection of phone records by government surveillance programs poses a clear threat to the personal privacy of ordinary citizens, according to U.S. researchers who used basic phone records to identify people and uncover confidential information about their lives.
Armed with anonymous “metadata” about people’s calls and texts, but not about the content of communications, two scientists at Stanford University drew up the names of people, where they lived, and the names of their partners. But that wasn't all.
The same data led them to discover potentially sensitive information about some people. One man was found to own a rifle, while another had recently been diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat. Other data point to a new pregnancy and a person with multiple sclerosis.
The results highlight the extraordinary power of phone metadata – the number called, when and for how long – especially when combined with publicly available information from services such as Google, Yelp and Facebook. The value of the data, which are not subject to the same legal protections as the content of people's communications, has long been recognized by the security services. As Stewart Baker, the former General Counselor of the United States National Security Agency (NSA), said, following Edward Snowden’s revelations: “Metadata tells you absolutely everything about someone’s life.”
Patrick Mutchler, a computer security researcher at Stanford, said that while the power of metadata was understood by those who collected the information, the public was largely in the dark because so few published studies have revealed how rich the data are. “That makes it difficult for people with strong opinions about these programs to fight against them. Now, we have strong evidence that that didn’t exist in the past,” he said.
For the study, researchers signed 823 people who agreed to have metadata collected from their phones via an Android app. The app also received information from their Facebook accounts, which scientists used to check the accuracy of their results. In total, researchers collected metadata in more than 250,000 calls and more than 1.2 million texts.
Analysts who entered the NSA metadata collection system were initially allowed to examine data up to three leaps away from an individual. A call from the target individual's phone to another number was a leap. There were two jumps from that phone to another. And so on. The records available to analysts were extended for five years. The collection window has now been limited to two hops and a maximum of 18 months.
Writing in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Mutchler describes how, on a tight budget, he and his graduate partner, Jonathan Mayer, discovered a lot of personal information, part of it sensitive, about the people who participated in the study. Through automatic and manual searches, 82% of people's names were identified. The same technique gave them the names of the businesses that people had called. When these were mapped, they revealed local business clusters, which scientists speculated surrounded the person's home. In this way, they named the people of the city living at 57% of the time, and they were almost 90% accurate when they placed the people within 50 miles of their home. Mutchler believes that some of the faults come from people who don't update their Facebook page when they moved from their parents' home, for example, to go to college.
The scientists then deepened into more personal territory. Using a simple computer program to analyze people's call patterns, they infer who among the study volunteers was in a relationship. Once they knew that the owner of a particular number had a partner, identifying the other significant was easy, they reported.
For the final part of the study, the researchers deepened further, to see what sensitive information they could extract from the phone metadata. They gathered details of calls made to and a list of organizations, including hospitals, pharmacies, religious groups, legal services, firearms retailers and repair companies. From them, they put together some extraordinary vignettes of people’s lives.
The metadata of one person in the study showed that they received a long call from a cardiology center, spoke briefly to a medical laboratory, responded to a series of short calls from a local pharmacy, and then made calls to a hotline for abnormal heart rate control devices. Another participant made frequent calls to a local gun supplier specializing in semi-automatic rifles and later made several long calls to the customer service hotline led by a major gun manufacturer producing the rifles. The metadata of two others suggest that one had multiple sclerosis and the other had just become pregnant.
“All of this should be taken as an indication of what is possible with two graduate students and limited resources,” said Mutchler, who argues that the findings should make policymakers think twice before authorizing mass surveillance programs. “Large-scale metadata monitoring programmes, such as those of the NSA, will necessarily expose highly confidential information about ordinary citizens,” scientists write, adding: “To strike an appropriate balance between national security and civil liberties, future policy formulation must be based on input from relevant sciences.”
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, said the study provided numbers on which discussions can now be based. “With the correct analysis of communications data at the national level, a large amount of sensitive information about everyone can be inferred. We always suspected that, of course, but here are the data.”

"A classical formulation of a criterionological argument for miracles is employed by Charles Leslie (1697/1815: 13), who argues that we can safely believe a historical statement that meets four criteria:
Let matters of fact be such, as that the outward senses of men, their eyes and ears, may be judges of it.
Let it be done publicly in the face of the world.
Not only should public monuments be kept in memory of this, but some external actions should also be carried out.
That such monuments, and such actions or observances, should be instituted and begin from the moment the question of fact was made.
The first two criteria, Leslie explains, “make it impossible for any question of fact to be imposed on men, at a time when it is said that such a fact is done, because the eyes and senses of each man contradict it.” The last two criteria assure those who come after that the account of the event was not invented after the time of the supposed event. Leslie points out that these criteria are not necessary conditions for factual truth, but insists that they are — taken together — sufficient. Therefore, we can talk about Leslie's principle: If any reported event meets all four of these criteria, then its historicity is true.
In evaluating a criterionological argument, we have to ask ourselves not only whether the event in question meets the criteria, but also whether the criteria themselves are good indicators of truth. An argument for the criteria that Leslie gives cannot proceed altogether a priori, as there is no necessary connection between the satisfaction of an event the criteria and its true being. In this case, perhaps the most promising approach would be to argue that the criteria effectively rule out explanations other than the truth of the claim. Leslie's comments suggest that this is the direction she would go if challenged, but does not offer a fully developed defense of her criteria.
Leslie's argument is, in the sense described above, categorical: he maintains that, as the affirmation of the resurrection meets all four criteria (the monuments provided by the Christian commemoration of the last supper and the transfer of the day of worship from Saturday to the first day of the week (Sunday), the certainty of the question of fact in question is ""proved"". This rather bold statement opens up the possibility of refuting Leslie’s principle by counter-example, though supposedly Conyers Middleton, Hume’s contemporary whose criticism of ecclesiastical miracles was notable for his meticulousness, sought for years uselessly a counter-example of Leslie’s principle. In any case, a criterionological argument can also be constructed on the basis of a more modest principle, as if any reported event meets all four of these criteria, then it is reasonable to accept its historicity.
The main difficulty with criteria, whether bold or modest, is that they do not provide any means to take into account any other consideration that might weigh against the historical claim in question. Intuitively, the improbability of an extreme background must have some weight in our assessment of the credibility of a de facto statement. An advocate of a criterionological argument might answer that as long as the bar is high enough, the prior improbability will be overwhelmed by the fact that the event actually meets the stipulated criteria. But this is an affirmation that requires argument; and the bolder the conclusion, the more argument it requires.",C2
"Philosophers generally agree that we can be justified in believing 15bi and 15biii only empirically. However, many believe that they are necessarily true. If they are necessarily true, that would mean that it is false that we can be justified in believing the necessary truths only a priori. But some philosophers think that 15bi and 15biii are not necessary truths and the relevant necessary truth that we can know a priori is that the essence of any kind of matter is given by the basic elements of which it is composed. From this point of view, in the case of water and rubies, we empirically discover what these basic elements are and the propositions that state that these discoveries are contingent. Philosophers who argue that 15bi and 15biii express necessary truths generally think that there are descriptions that fix the reference of terms, for example, for water, description,
matter, whatever it is, which, in today's world, has the properties of quenching thirst, extinguishing certain fires, falling from clouds like rain, filling lakes and rivers, etc.
While the meaning of “water” is given by this reference-fixing description, and can be known a priori, the essence of water must be empirically discovered. The meaning of terms of natural nature does not give the essence of the type directly in the way it does with “bachelor” and “vixen”.
One might think that 15th can only be empirically justified, but gemologists seem to think that conceptually it is necessary for rubies to be red, that is, that the meaning of ""ruby"" requires rubies to be red. So given how gemologists use ruby, 15th is known a priori. The notion of ruby seems to be a hybrid notion: its color is known a priori, but its material essence as it is given in 15bi is only empirically known.
Although it is widely believed that some necessary truths are capable of being justified and can only be known empirically (for example, “Water is H2O”), some contingent truths also seem justifiable, and knowledgeable, a priori. Saul Kripke proposed that “the standard meter stick, S, in Paris is a meter long in
t
0
“ is such an example (Kripke 1972: 274-275). “The length of S in today’s world
t
0
“ rigidly designates that length, that is, it refers to the length L in every possible world. The reference of “one metre” is given by that description of reference fixation, so “one metre” rigidly designates L. However, “the length of S in
t
0
“ does not rigidly designate any particular length since in
t
0
in other possible worlds S will be longer or shorter than L. So the proposition that “S is a meter long in
t
0
“ is contingent because in other possible worlds that same stick will be shorter or longer than it was in the present world at that time. However, we can know a priori, i.e. regardless of any empirical evidence, that “S is a meter long in
t
0
“ is true in today’s world since we know how the reference of “one meter” is set by a description that refers to the length of S in the real world. If empirical evidence plays any role, it is only to the extent that we need you to know that there really is a stick, S, which was designated as the meter at some particular time and place.",C2
"As human rights defenders around the world celebrate the 64th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights this week, their counterparts in the United States are mourning the Senate's rejection last week of the international convention on the rights of persons with disabilities. Applauding in its own right, the defeat of the senatorial Republicans of the first human rights treaty of the twenty-first century is a sad but acute reminder that disinformation and fear can still prevail over the fundamental principles of human decency and common sense.
More importantly, it is another blow to the ability of the United States to play a leading role in promoting freedoms and human dignity in the world.
The international charter of rights adopted by the United Nations on 10 December 1948 remains the standard of gold in the daily struggle for basic human rights today. As our societies democratize, mature and progress, human rights defenders are winning long-standing battles to expand the boundaries of rights to women, children, indigenous peoples, LGBT communities and migrants. Economic and social rights are also ascending, and people claim the essentials of human life: water, food, health, employment and education.
The United States has a long and generally bipartisan tradition of concern for human rights, a pillar of its founding principles. Americans have also been at the forefront of the global human rights movement for generations and we consider ourselves a leading example for others in a rights-respecting society, even if we still have a lot of work to do to improve our record. In fact, it was Congress' approval of the American Disability Act in 1990 that paved the way for the international campaign for disability rights and served as a standard for the treaty that the Senate rejected.
However, when it comes to international law, some Americans get confused. The image of the United Nations as a supranational body with the powers to insert itself into our living rooms persists despite the fact that there is no evidence to support it.
This myth, and its inherent contradictions, are on display in Rick Santorum's strange essay of opinion published last week in The Daily Beast. In it, the leader of the conservative movement, in order to defeat the treaty, claims that unelected UN bureaucrats could take power away from parents to demand special education services for a disabled child. He then states that there is no point in ratifying the treaty because it would not oblige any foreign government to amend its laws or spend resources on the disabled. That is what these governments must decide.
Precisely. The hallmark of the United Nations human rights system is its success in developing international standards for the protection of a comprehensive set of human rights, monitoring States ' respect for those rights and making recommendations for improving their records. In exceptional cases of serious violations, such as war crimes and mass atrocities, governments - LRB - although not the United States -RRB - have agreed on a stronger set of mechanisms, such as the International Criminal Court, to hold people accountable.
The new doctrine of responsibility to protect civilians has even been applied to prevent the killing of civilians in Libya. But these measures are far from any alleged interference by UN lawyers in our schools and homes.
At the end of the day, however, national sovereignty overcomes these efforts, leaving any State free to follow its own path to govern its people. For better or worse, that's how it works.
There is a broader and disheartening message that the world hears from Washington on International Human Rights Day this year: America is losing its moral voice on human rights because it is not setting an example.
As a human rights defender recently told me, his government routinely cites the U.S. treatment of detainees in Guantánamo as justification for their own human rights violations. When the exceptional case, as well as the necessary measures taken to wage a battle against terrorists, becomes a norm, we have lost an important source of credibility to promote the basic principles of due process and innocence until proven guilty.
Unfortunately, the victory of the conservative movement in defeating the treaty on the rights of persons with disabilities is only the last example of our political leaders failing to turn high-level rhetoric into meaningful action when it comes to human rights. If a Republican war hero like Bob Dole, who uses a wheelchair, cannot persuade his colleagues to do the right thing, then we are all the losers in the battle for human rights.
The views expressed in this commentary are only those of Ted Piccone.

"What is the connection between self-consciousness and the consciousness of others? In some points of view self-consciousness requires the consciousness of others, in other points of view the consciousness of others requires self-consciousness. In each case we can distinguish between those accounts according to which such consciousness is merely an empirical condition of those according to which it is a strictly necessary/sufficient condition. A distinction must also be made with regard to the sense of “consciousness of others” at stake: while some philosophers care about the knowledge of other minds, others are content with the representation of others, true or not.
A familiar account of our knowledge of others takes the form of an analogy argument (Slot 1970: chap. 4; Avramides 2001: Part I). The analogy argument presents an account of our justification for moving from judgments on the observable behavior of others to judgments on their unobservable mental states. I am aware of my own case that, say, winking is the result of pain, so, seeing someone else's wink, I am justified in judging that they are in pain. In this picture, self-consciousness, as manifested in the judgment on my own case, is a necessary condition of the knowledge of other minds. In this sense, the point of view is related to contemporary simulation theory, whose standard versions view our ability to attribute mental states to others as dependent on our ability to attribute them to ourselves (Heal 1986; Goldman 2006: ch. 9; for a simulationist theory that differs in this regard, see Gordon 1996). Associated with the analogy argument is a point of view according to which our understanding of the concepts of mental state is essentially a first personal matter. That is, we understand what, for example, pain is first of our own case (Nagel 1986: §2.3; Peacoke 2008: ch. 5–6; it has sometimes been claimed that this vision gives rise to the conceptual problem of other minds, see Wittgenstein 1958: §302; McGinn 1984; Avramides 2001: part II).
In opposition to this set of views on which our understanding and application of the concepts of mental state is neutral between the cases of first and third person. Theorists of theory, for example, claim that we attribute mental states to both ourselves and others through a psychological (tacitally sustained) theory. They can also argue that the possession of such a theory constitutes our understanding of the concepts of mental state (Carruthers 1996, 2011: ch. 8; Gopnik & Meltzoff 1997; for an account combining theory elements with simulation elements, see Nichols & Stich 2003). Although such views do not give priority to the case in the first person, they can see a close connection between self-consciousness and our ability to think about others: these are simply two aspects of the more general ability to think about the mind. A distinct but related family sees both self-consciousness and the consciousness of others as the emergence of a primitive “adualistic” state in which self and others do not distinguish themselves (Piaget 1937; Merleau-Ponty 1960; Barresi & Moore 1996; Hurley 2005; Gallese 2005; see also D. Stern 1985: Part II). Against such ""adualistic"" views, it is often claimed that neonate imitation phenomena, joint attention and regulation of emotion show that babies show a consciousness of others like others from the beginning of life (Meltzoff & Moore 1977; Trevarthen 1979; Hurley & Chater 2005; Eilan et al. 2005; Legerstee 2005; Reddy 2008). An empirical proposal is that it is from this early form of social interaction and ability to understand others that self-consciousness emerges as a self-directed form of mental reading (Carruthers 2011; Carruthers, Fletcher, & Ritchie 2012; for an early account of this type, see Mead 1934). In this view, the case in the first person is treated as secondary, reversing the traditional picture associated with the analogy argument.

"All we know about the so-called founder of the so-called dialectical school, Clinomaco de Thurii, is that he was the first to write about preaching (katêgorêmata) and propositions (axiômata) and similar (DL 2.112). Our evidence for Diodoro and Philo confirms that they, too, conceived logic as a logic of propositions. It was the Stoics who systematically developed a logic of propositions and devised subtle classifications of predicates. (On the contrary, Aristotle's logic had been a logic of terms, where the terms subject and preached were in principle interchangeable.) Thus, the logic of dialectical school was a precursor to stoic logic.
In the time of Diodorus and Philon a distinction between simple and non-simple propositions was in circulation among the minor Greek socratic philosophical sects (DL 2,139). Simple propositions were divided into affirmations and denials (ibid.). Among the non-simple propositions, which were thought to be composed of simple ones, conditionalities, disjunctions and conjunctions were distinguished. Disjunctions or conditionalities were presented as premises in many of the logical paradoxes and sophisms discussed by the members of the dialectical school. Diodoro and Philo are likely to examine the truth conditions of the three kinds of non-simple propositions; however, we know their views only for the case of conditionality (see below sect. 3).
His treatment of conditionalities and modalities implies that —like most Hellenistic philosophers — Diodorus and Filo worked with a concept of proposition that differs from ours in that it allows the values of truth to change over time. For example, the standard example for a simple proposition, ‘It’s the day’, does not contain a fixed date or defined time determination; rather, it varies over time, changing its truth value twice a day, while it remains the same proposition. Thus we can think of propositions as understood by Hellenistic philosophers as functions of time. Diodoro Cronus may also be credited with the beginnings of temporal logic, since both his theory of conditionality and his narratives of modalities are constructed on logically relevant temporal properties of propositions (see sects below. 3.2 and 4.2). In addition, he distinguished between propositions at the present time as ‘Helen has three husbands’ and ‘These men are getting married’ and propositions at a time of completion (the aorist), ‘Helen had three husbands’ and ‘These men got married’, and observed that it is possible that propositions such as the last two are true, without there ever being a time when one of the previous corresponding types was true (Sextus Espiritus [SE], Against physicists 2.97-8).
Apart from the various logical puzzles and sophisms, there are only two topics on which we can be sure of a positive contribution to logic on the part of the members of the dialectical school. These are the positions of Diodorus and Philon on the theory of conditionals and on modal logic. Both issues involve notorious difficulties and were discussed extensively and intensively by Hellenist logicists; so much so that disputes became part of the general knowledge of the intellectuality of the time (SE, Contra los Grammarianos 309-10). In addition, the theory of modalities was believed to have far-reaching results in other areas of philosophy.

"It's called Godwin's law. The longer a debate lasts, the greater the likelihood that someone will compare another to Hitler.
And Hillary Clinton has done just that: On Tuesday the former Secretary of State told a private fundraising party that the actions of Russian President Vladimir Putin are similar to those of Hitler in the run-up to World War II.
His quote -LRB- according to the Long Beach Press-Telegram -RRB-: All the Germans who were... the ethnic Germans, the Germans of descent who were in places like Czechoslovakia and Romania and elsewhere, Hitler continued to say that they were not being treated properly. I have to go and protect my people, and that's what makes everyone so nervous.
Of course, what also makes everyone so nervous are state leaders who compare Putin to Hitler and therefore raise the spectrum of another world war.
It is unlikely that Clinton intended to win politically with these comments, and they were carefully qualified. He added that there is no indication that Putin is as irrational as the German dictator was. But they could indicate that if it wins the 2016 elections, the U.S. could win a slightly stronger president in foreign affairs, someone more willing to participate directly in Europe than Obama. You may remember that in the 2008 primary she was the candidate for Democratshawk, so much so that Ann Coulter preferred her to John McCain - LRB- Coulter called her our girl -RRB-.
But Clinton was right? Mostly not. It is true that Putin's justification for intervening in Ukraine is similar to Hitler's, that is, he threatens to invade sovereign territory to defend his ethnic brothers. But the situation is complex, and the historical comparison is tenuous at best.
After all, in the eyes of many ethnic Russians, it is the Ukrainian nationalists -- not Putin -- the Nazis. The Russians have stated, quite accurately, that the revolution that overthrew a democratically elected pro-Russian leader has led to the rise of the Russophobic fascists to key positions in government. For example, the new secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine is Andriy Parubiy, co-founder of the Neonazi National Social Party of Ukraine (LRB-SNPU-RRB).
Another creator of SNPU is Oleh Tyahnybok, a high-profile leader of Kiev protests who has blamed Ukraine's problems for a Jewish conspiracy that has just ended in Moscow. The new Undersecretary of National Security of Ukraine is Dmytro Yarosh, leader of the right-wing sector group, who regards Tyahnybok as a soft liberal and who hoists the old flag of Ukrainian Nazi collaborators at their rallies.
In other words, in this situation, who exactly are the Nazis? Putin's ethnic Russian nationalists? Or aside from Ukrainian ethnic nationalists? Neither of us is particularly nice.
Of course, the Ukrainian Nazi movement is small, and Ukraine is dwarfed by Russia, which puts Putin in the role of the dominant regional power that gets into a small country and exploits its extremist policy for propaganda purposes. But Putin is not Hitler yet, because he lacks the German Fuehrer's global vision.
Hitler worked for a racist ideology of all scope that dreamed of turning Europe into a giant space of life for his people. Putin -- the leader of a democracy, though highly corrupt and politically stagnant -- simply meddles in the affairs of countries that could reasonably be said to fall within the historical sphere of influence of his country. Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union until two decades ago - LRB- while Crimea was part of Russia until 1954 -RRB-, the country contains millions of ethnic Russians and, crucially, has Russian military facilities that are key to Russia's strategic interests.
In other words, a Russian invasion of Ukraine is not going to be a stepping stone to the invasion of France. Unfortunately, it may well be a step towards participation in the affairs of the Baltic States, which are firmly in NATO and the EU. That is why Putin's last ambitions must be checked.
However, calling Putin Hitler is careless. Even reckless. As Marc Tracy points out in the New Republic, it is historically insensitive and ignores the tapestry of ongoing cultural clashes and political calculations. It also reeks of the Manichaean division of the world between good and evil that permeated the war on terror and led to so many terrible mistakes and so many American deaths abroad. Worse still, that provocative language should be applied to a confrontation with a state like Russia.
We are dealing with a major nuclear weapon power that has the ability to reduce the world to so much irradiated ash. The West must be careful with its words.

Is he gonna put it down?
Netanyahu has managed to remain in office during the investigations and three election campaigns, with a fourth election scheduled for 23 March.
He denies having committed a crime and a trial is likely to take years. He will fight to remain prime minister in March and possibly for years later. If he wins, he could try to secure parliamentary immunity, or pass laws to exempt a serving prime minister from trial.
How did you stay in the office?
Under Israeli law, a prime minister has no obligation to withdraw unless he is convicted. No other government minister is protected in this way, so there are legal and political reasons why Netanyahu wants to stay at the top.
ISRAELIS?
Yeah. The corruption case has had a polarizing impact on Israelis. Thousands of protesters gather weekly outside their official residence and through Israel under the banner of the “Minister of Crime,” demanding that they resign.
But his right-wing voter base has remained loyal. Supporters see the man they call King Bibi as strong in security and an influential voice for Israel abroad.
What are the charges?
The 4000 case alleges that Netanyahu granted regulatory favours worth approximately 1.8 billion shekels (about $500 million) to the Bezeq Telecom Israel telecommunications company. In return, prosecutors say, he sought positive coverage of himself and his wife Sara on a news website controlled by former company president Shaul Elovitch.
In this case, Netanyahu has been charged with bribery, fraud and abuse of trust. Elovitch and his wife, Iris, have been charged with bribery and obstruction of justice. The couple denies having committed a crime.
CASE 1000, in which Netanyahu has been charged with fraud and abuse of trust, focuses on allegations that he and his wife illegally received nearly 700,000 shekels of gifts from Hollywood producer and Israeli citizen Arnon Milchan, and Australian billionaire businessman James Packer.
Prosecutors said the gifts included champagne and cigars and Netanyahu helped Milchan with his commercial interests. Packer and Milchan don't face charges.
CASE 2000 alleges that Netanyahu negotiated an agreement with Arnon Mozes, owner of the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, for better coverage and that, in return, he offered legislation that would slow the growth of a rival newspaper. Netanyahu has been charged with fraud and abuse of trust. Mozes has been accused of offering a bribe, and denies evil.
What does Netanyahu say?
Netanyahu says he is the victim of a politically orchestrated “witch hunt” by the left and the media to expel him from office, and that receiving gifts from friends is not illegal.
Could you go to jail?
Bribery charges carry a prison sentence of up to 10 years and/or a fine. Fraud and breach of trust carry a sentence of up to three years.
Is a Verdict coming soon?
Not likely. The trial could take years. However, proceedings could be interrupted if Netanyahu requests a plea agreement.",C2
"Long before “postmodernism” became fashionable, Adorno and Horkheimer wrote one of the most interesting criticisms of modernity that have emerged among progressive European intellectuals. The dialectic of Enlightenment is a product of his exile in times of war. He first appeared as a mimeographer entitled Philosophical Fragments in 1944. This title became the subtitle when the book was published in 1947. His book begins with a grim assessment of the modern West: “Illumination, understood in the broadest sense as the advance of thought, has always been aimed at freeing human beings from fear and installing them as teachers. However, the fully illuminated earth radiates under the sign of a triumphant disaster” (DE 1, modified translation). How can this be, the authors ask. How can the progress of modern science, medicine, and industry promise to free people from ignorance, disease, and brutal work and mental numbness, yet help create a world where people will willingly swallow fascist ideology, deliberately practice genocide, and vigorously develop lethal weapons of mass destruction? The reason, they respond, has become irrational.
Although Francis Bacon is cited as the chief spokesman for an instrumentalized reason that becomes irrational, Horkheimer and Adorno do not think that modern science and science are the only culprits. The tendency of rational progress to become irrational regression arises much earlier. In fact, they cite both Hebrew scriptures and Greek philosophers as a contribution to regressive tendencies. If Horkheimer and Adorno are right, then a critique of modernity must also be a critique of premodernity, and a turn toward the postmodern cannot be simply a return to the premodern. Otherwise, the failures of modernity will continue under a new appearance in contemporary conditions. Society as a whole needs to be transformed.
Horkheimer and Adorno believe that society and culture form a historical whole, so that the search for freedom in society is inseparable from the search for enlightenment in culture (DE xvi). There is an opposite side to this: the lack or loss of freedom in society—in the political, economic and legal structures within which we live—points to a concomitant failure in cultural enlightenment—in philosophy, the arts, religion, etc. The Nazi extermination camps are not an aberration, nor are they studio films with no sense of innocent entertainment. Both indicate that something fundamental has gone wrong in the modern West.
According to Horkheimer and Adorno, the source of today's disaster is a pattern of blind domination, domination in a triple sense: the domination of nature by human beings, the domination of nature within human beings, and, in both forms of domination, the domination of some human beings by others. What motivates this triple domination is an irrational fear of the unknown: “Humans believe themselves free from fear when nothing is unknown anymore. This has determined the path of demytologization... Enlightenment is a mythical radicalized fear” (DE 11). In a non-free society whose culture pursues so-called progress regardless of cost, which is “other”, whether human or non-human, it is left aside, exploited or destroyed. The means of destruction may be more sophisticated in the modern West, and exploitation may be less direct than direct slavery, but blind, fear-driven domination continues, with ever-increasing global consequences. The engine that consumes this whole process is a constantly expanding capitalist economy, fueled by scientific research and the latest technologies.
Contrary to some interpretations, Horkheimer and Adorno do not reject the 18th-century Enlightenment. Nor do they provide a negative “metanarrative” of universal historical decline. Rather, through a very unusual combination of philosophical argument, sociological reflection and literary and cultural commentary, they build a “double perspective” on the modern West as a historical formation (Jarvis 1998, 23). He summarizes this double perspective in two interrelated thesis: “The myth is already enlightenment, and enlightenment returns to mythology” (DE xviii). The first thesis allows them to suggest that, despite having been declared mythical and outdated by the forces of secularization, the oldest rituals, religions and philosophies may have contributed to the process of enlightenment and may still have something worth contributing. The second thesis allows them to expose ideological and destructive tendencies within modern secularization forces, but without denying that these forces are progressive and enlightening or that the older conceptions they displaced were themselves ideological and destructive.
A fundamental error in many interpretations of the Dialectics of Enlightenment occurs when readers take such thesis as theoretical definitions of immutable categories rather than critical judgments on historical trends. The authors are not saying that myth is “by nature” a force of enlightenment. Nor do they claim that enlightenment “inevitably” returns to mythology. In fact, what they find really mythical in both myth and enlightenment is the thought that fundamental change is impossible. Such resistance to change characterizes both the ancient myths of destiny and modern devotion to facts.
Consequently, by building a “dialectic of enlightenment” the authors seek simultaneously to carry out a dialectical illumination of enlightenment not unlike the Phenomenology of the Spirit of Hegel. Two Hegelian concepts anchor this project, namely, determined negation and conceptual self-reflection. The “determined denial” (bestimmte Negation) indicates that immanent criticism is the way to uproot the truth from ideology. A dialectical illumination of enlightenment “discovers each image as a script. It teaches us to read from [the image] the admission of falsehood that nullifies its power and surrenders it to the truth” (DE 18). Beyond and through such determined denial, a dialectical illumination of enlightenment also recalls the origin and goal of thought itself. Such a memory is the work of the concept as the self-reflection of thought (der Begriff als Selbstbesinnung des Denkens, DE 32). Conceptual self-reflection reveals that thought arises from the very corporeal needs and desires that are forgotten when thought becomes a mere instrument of human self-preservation. It also reveals that the goal of thought is not to continue the blind domination of nature and human beings, but to aim towards reconciliation. Adorno develops the details of this conception in his subsequent lectures on Kant (KC), Ethics (PMP) and Metaphysics (MCP) and in his books on Husserl (AE), Hegel (H), and Heidegger (JA). His most complete statement occurs in Negative Dialectica, which is discussed later.

"One day that began with a new round of dawn raids at the Baur Au Lac Hotel in Zurich ended with 16 football officials being charged with corruption charges in the U.S., including five current or former members of the FIFA executive committee. Among them were the famous former head of the Brazilian federation Ricardo Teixeira and his successor, Marco Polo Del Nero, who recently resigned from the FIFA executive committee.
They were among 16 persons charged with fraud and other crimes by the United States Department of Justice, as it established a series of bribery schemes in a new 240-page indictment that replaced the previous one in May 2015. The number of defendants indicted by the United States is required for 27. with 24 other nameless co-conspirators including former FIFA executive committee members. “The betrayal of trust here exposed is outrageous,” said U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch. “The magnitude of the corruption alleged here is completely unacceptable.”
On a day when the FIFA executive committee expected to present new reforms in the midst of an ongoing corruption crisis, the Swiss police led the president of the South American football confederation, Paraguayan Juan Ángel Napout, and Alfredo Hawit, the head of the governing body of North America and Central America and the Caribbean. Hawit only succeeded Jeffrey Webb in May 2015, after Webb was arrested as part of the US operation that launched FIFA into the crisis and precipitated the fall of Sepp Blatter. Webb's predecessor, controversial Jack Warner, was also captured in May.
The Swiss Federal Office of Justice said of the latest arrests: “They are detained pending extradition. According to U.S. arrest requests, they are suspected of accepting bribes of millions of dollars.” Webb and former Colombian executive committee member Luis Bedoya were among those who pleaded guilty in the United States. Lynch said eight people, five of them nameless in the original indictment, had pleaded guilty since May.
Eleven current members and former members of the FIFA executive committee have been indicted in the investigation, which alleges $200 million in bribes, mainly as bribes from television and marketing contracts, but also from FIFA's development programs. The last three chairmen of the regional bodies CONCACAF and Conmebol have been charged.
“The message of this announcement must be clear to every guilty individual who remains in the shadows, hoping to evade our investigation: you will not escape our focus,” Lynch said. Teixeira, the former son-in-law of the former FIFA president, João Havelange, was accused along with Del Nero and his predecessor, José María Marin, who was charged in May.
Fourteen men had been charged in May 2015, when four more guilty pleas were filed. Days later, Blatter won a fifth term as president, but later agreed to resign as the crisis grew. He was then provisionally suspended with UEFA President Michel Platini for a supposed £1.3 million “unfair payment” to the French. Both men face possible life bans when their case is heard by the FIFA ethics committee in December if they are found guilty of the charges.
Among those who were also charged on Thursday were Rafael Salguero, a Guatemalan who left the executive committee in May; former Secretary General of the South American Confederation, Eduardo Deluca; former president of the Peruvian football federation, Manuel Burga; and the president of Bolivia, Carlos Chaves, already imprisoned in his own country.
Lynch said: “The Department of Justice is committed to ending the rampant corruption we have described in the midst of international football leadership, not only because of the magnitude of the plans alleged before and today, or because of the breadth of the operation needed to sustain such corruption, but also because of the affront to the international principles represented by this behavior.”
The acting president of FIFA, Issa Hayatou, refused to comment on the details of the latest arrests. But neither he nor the organization was corrupt. When he first appeared before the media since he took over the role in September 2015, when Blatter was suspended, Hayatou responded similarly to his predecessors by improbably claiming that the current crisis was due to a handful of wandering individuals.
“FIFA is not corrupt. We have individuals who have shown negative behavior. Don’t generalize the situation,” said Hayatou, president of the African Football Confederation for more than 25 years. “There are many people who have been in FIFA for more than 20 or 30 years who have not been accused of anything.”

"When it comes to climate change, we have the bad habit of focusing on the first part of history, the part about the problem, and forgetting the second part about the many solutions available. These solutions are accelerating recycling, slowing emissions and providing sustainable alternatives to plastic, air conditioning, smartphones and fast fashion.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently met in Copenhagen to present its latest report on the impact and pace of climate change. Climate change is now measured on all continents and our efforts to reduce emissions must be intensified to prevent it from getting out of control. In addition to outlining risks and challenges, Copenhagen also adopted and focused on solutions.
In the spirit of focusing on what can be done, the Sustainability Award, chaired by Arnold Schwarzenegger, celebrated ten outstanding sustainability solutions deployed in 84 countries. From food to fashion, energy to transport, education to health, the awards showed an alternative to the grim and future scenarios that are often presented to us and make sustainability tangible for innovators, investors, consumers and policy makers in all sectors and regions.
From California, we saw how we can now produce plastics from greenhouse gases that are competitive with normal oil-based plastics in price and quality. From Switzerland, we have learned how we can recycle and reuse old clothes and shoes more effectively in a recycling system currently deployed in more than 60 countries. And from Canada, we learned how smartphones can make bike sharing more convenient.
The ten projects presented each offered unique solutions to sustainability challenges, but it was the Nigerian initiative, Wecyclers, that won Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the rest of the jury, that voted and received the 2014 Sustainability Award.
The Wecyclers allow low-income communities to make money from waste that accumulates on their streets. By deploying a fleet of cargo bikes to collect and recycle unmanaged waste in Lagos, Wecyclers allows families to exchange garbage for consumer goods through an SMS-based point system.
Recycling companies buy Wecyclers classified waste for reprocessing into products – they turn it into mattresses, pillows and garbage bags. Wecyclers is a response to local waste problems, where it is estimated that only 40% of the city's garbage is collected. According to the World Bank, only 46 per cent of municipal solid waste is collected in Africa. To date, more than 5,000 households have been registered and plans are under way to extend the initiative to other cities in Nigeria.
Solutions to combat climate change are often perceived as high-tech innovations focusing on emission reduction, infrastructure development or efficiency. However, to successfully solve the variety of challenges, we also need variety in our solutions. Sustainability is not just a matter of reducing emissions; it is also a matter of using our natural resources smarter and creating healthier lives for ourselves. Initiatives can be low-tech in innovation but high-impact when it comes to creating sustainable change for entire communities.
With a wide range of solutions addressing the equally wide range of challenges, we must focus more on the important part of history that creates enthusiasm and momentum, and stimulates action to bring about the much-needed changes.

"Regius attributed his appointment at the University of Utrecht to his familiarity and support for Cartesian philosophy, which was initially acquired by reading Descartes' first book, the Discours de la Méthode... plus the Dioptrique, les Météores et la Géometrie, 1637 (AT, vol. VI). Regius was sympathetic to the natural Cartesian philosophy of his initial reading and began to teach it to students, in private classes, and to dictate notes in order to publish his own summary of natural philosophy based on Cartesian principles. This objective was further encouraged when he read a copy of Descartes' unpublished manuscript, Le Monde (AT, vol. XI), in 1641. Le Monde's natural philosophy rejected scholastic forms and qualities as philosophical entities that contributed nothing to an explanation of natural phenomena. However, there was a significant difference in a university like Utrecht between not relying on scholastic forms and publicly criticizing them. The transition from the first to the second, in the case of Regius, occurred in 1641.
While preparing Physiologia (Regio 1641a), Regius sent advance copies of the draft disputes to Descartes. Since they were presented in Utrecht as examples of Cartesian philosophy, Descartes recommended several changes, both to avoid unnecessary controversies (e.g. on blood circulation) and, more importantly, to avoid accusations of heresy against himself or Regius. He therefore asked Regius to correct the thesis that the human soul is threefold, and to argue instead that “in human beings the soul is one, that is, a rational soul” (AT III, 369–74: Bos 2002, 63–69). During the year 1641, this previous consultation pattern with Descartes continued; Regius accepted many of Descartes' suggestions, and incorporated them into the final versions of the disputes.
In November 1641, however, the professor of Utrecht opened another series of disputes in which he transgressed from medicine to philosophy and, by implication, to theology, and provoked a controversy that continued for more than a decade. The most explicit challenge to established Aristotelian teaching occurred when one of Regius' students, Henricus van Loon, stated in a dispute (8 December 1641) that the human mind and body are two distinct substances that unite in an accidental union [unum per accidents]. This thesis addresses, perhaps by inadvertence, one of the most controversial issues in Christian philosophy and theology, namely. how to understand the unity of human nature, as experienced by each subject, and at the same time defend traditional Christian beliefs in the immortality of the human soul or mind and the resurrection of the body. The immortality of the soul seemed to suppose that the mind or soul was able to exist without the body and, for that reason, that it should be classified as an Aristotelian substance. When Descartes was informed of this dispute (when it was too late to recommend amendments), he replied that there was hardly anything more likely to offend or antagonize theologians than to say that a human being “is an accidental being” (AT III, 460: Bos 2002, 90-91).
Voetius, with the support of his fellow professors of theology, responded to Regius by adding corollaries to his own theological disputes, in December 1641, in which he accused the defenders of the ‘new philosophy’ [that is, Cartesianism] of a series of errors: to teach that a human being is an accidental being, to defend copernicanism, and to support skepticism and irreligion by denying substantial forms. In the course of these responses to Regius, the name Descartes was also mentioned, and it was clear that Reius and Descartes were perceived by Voetius as a joint attempt to undermine the philosophical foundations of Calvinist theology as taught in Utrecht. Initially, Descartes joined the debate simply advising Regius how to respond appropriately to Voetius. Part of that advice was that Regius should have dealt with substantial forms such as Descartes had done in the Météores (AT VI, 239): that he should not have explicitly rejected, but should have simply omitted as redundant genuine explanations.
However, Descartes also provided Regius with philosophical arguments in response to Voetius. He outlined a number of reasons why they were jointly opposed to describing the human mind as a substantial form. To say that humans think because they have a ‘thinking way’ does not explain anything; secondly, those who postulate the existence of substantial forms cannot say more precisely what they are, and therefore appeal to ‘hidden’ realities that they do not understand; and, perhaps most importantly, if the supposed substantial forms of other natural phenomena were redundant by the developments of physics, there would be a danger that the spirituality of the mind or soul would be compromised by similar advances in science. “All arguments used to demonstrate substantial forms can be applied to the shape of a clock, although no one claims to be substantial” (AT III, 505: Bos 2002, 115). Many of Descartes' suggestions were incorporated, as amendments, into the final version of the Regius' response to Voetius, which appeared as Responsio, sive notae in Apppendicem (Regius 1642) on February 16, 1642. This further enraged the situation. The following month, Regius was banned by the University to teach natural philosophy in public or private, and was restricted to teaching in traditional medicine. The Academic Senate, with the approval of the city council, also issued an official condemnation of Cartesian philosophy.",C2

"For nearly 100 years, police and intelligence agencies around the world have relied on lie detectors to help convict criminals or dig up spies and traitors.
The polygraph is very much loved by the films, with countless dramatic moments that show the culprits sweating profusely while they are connected.
But the invention could disappear soon. Researchers in Britain and the Netherlands have made a breakthrough, developing a method with a test success rate of more than 70% that could be in use in police stations around the world in a decade. Instead of relying on facial tics, talking too much or waving your arms – all seen as lying signs – the new method consists of monitoring the movements of the whole body to provide an indicator of signs of guilty feelings.
Polygraph is widely used in the U.S. in criminal and other cases and for security clearance for the FBI and the CIA, but it is much less popular in Europe. There has been a lot of scepticism in the scientific and legal communities about their reliability. On the contrary, the new method developed by researchers has worked well in experiments.
The basic premise is that liars become more concerned and therefore the wearing of an all-body motion suit – the type used in movies to create computer-generated characters – will collect this. The costume contains 17 sensors that record movement up to 120 times per second in three dimensions for 23 joints.
One of the researchers, Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, said: “Deads of deception research show that the interviewer will tell the truth of lies only slightly better than random, about 55 out of 100.
“Polygraph has existed since the 1920s and, by measuring physiological stress induced by anxiety, you can reach 60. However, it can easily be abused as interrogation support and many people are anxious anyway against a polygraph on which their work or freedom depends.”
He said that the new method, on the contrary, achieved a reliability rating of more than 70% and was sure they would be able to do better. In some tests, the team has already achieved more than 80%. Anderson said, “The message to take is that the guilty people are shaking more and we can measure this firmly.”
Anderson added that the investigation had a special significance at the moment, in the context of the U.S. Senate report on CIA torture. Apart from the moral case against torture, Anderson pointed out that it was a very unreliable way of gathering accurate information. “We’ve known for a long time that torture doesn’t work,” he said. The new method offers a pragmatic and scientifically supported alternative to conducting interviews. The research work was written by Dr. Sophie van der Zee of Cambridge University, Professor Ronald Poppe of Utrecht University, Professor Paul Taylor of Lancaster University and Anderson.
The polygraph was created in 1921 by police officer John Larson, based on the investigation of psychologist William Marston. It records changes in pulse, blood pressure, sweating, and breathing to determine if a subject is lying.
Although film representations suggest that the device is almost infallible, the United States Supreme Court ruled, in 1998, that there was no consensus that the polygraph was reliable, a finding supported by the United States National Academy of Scientists in 2003. The experiment carried out by Anderson and his colleagues involved 180 students and employees of Lancaster University, half of whom were told to tell the truth and half of whom lied. They were paid £7.50 for their participation in the 70-minute experiment, which included two tests.
Some were interviewed about a Never End computer game, which they played for seven minutes, while others lied about playing it, with only notes shown about it.
The second test included a lost portfolio containing £5. Some were asked to take the wallet to a lost box, while others hid it and lied about it.
“In general, we correctly classify 82.2% (truths: 88.9%; lies: 75.6%) of those interviewed as truthful or misleading based on the combined movement in their individual members,” the report says. Anderson said: “Our first attempt examined to what extent different parts of the body and signs of the body indicated deception. It turned out that liars shake their arms more, but, again, this is only at the 60% level that can be obtained from a conventional polygraph.
“The dirt of pay was when we considered the total movement of the body. That turns out to tell the truth of lies more than 70% of the time and we believe that it can be further improved if combined with optimal questioning techniques.”
Another advantage is that total body movement is not affected by cultural background, anxiety, and cognitive burden (how much you're thinking), which confuses other lie detection technologies, Anderson said.
The use of all-body suits is expensive – they cost around £30,000 – and can be uncomfortable, and Anderson and his colleagues are now looking for low-cost alternatives. These include the use of computer game motion detection technology, such as the Kinect devices developed by Microsoft for the Xbox console.
Anderson recognizes that agencies like the CIA could teach agents how to counter the whole body movement method by freezing their bodies, but said it would itself be a gift.

"The United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution on Monday to send 4,200 peacekeepers to Abyei, Sudan, as part of a recent agreement between the Sudan and Southern Sudan.
The resolution will establish, for six months, the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (LRB), UNISFA (RRB), consisting of up to 4,200 military personnel, 50 police officers and appropriate civilian support, as set out in the resolution.
He passed the council unanimously, 15-0.
In a statement issued by the State Department, Secretary Hilario Clinton commended the speedy adoption of the resolution.
Abyei has been a source of regional tension for many years, the statement said. We urge the parties to reach an immediate ceasefire and to provide humanitarian workers with the necessary unhindered access to provide humanitarian assistance to innocent civilians affected by the conflict.
A week ago, the Government of the Sudan and the Sudan People ' s Liberation Movement signed an agreement to allow Abyei peacekeepers to end the conflicts that have ravaged much of the country. The two parties agreed in principle on the need for a third party to monitor the ill-defined border between the north and the south before the independence scheduled for the south on 9 July.
United Nations peacekeepers will monitor and verify the redeployment of all Sudanese Armed Forces, the Sudan People ' s Liberation Army or its successor to the Abyei Area, among other tasks, notes the Security Council resolution.

"It is difficult to know exactly where the noise comes from, but it is impossible to miss it from anywhere in Damascus: all day long and night you can hear the clumsy blow of artillery, rockets or planes hitting rebel positions – the sound of the war approaching the capital of Syria. But little more than two years after the Syrian crisis – the longest and bloodiest of Arab revolts – ignoring the sound of death and destruction nearby has become the new normal for Damascenes.
During the weekend, men could be seen blowing in the water pipes in a palm shaded park, children playing between the flower beds and couples chatting on the benches as the unmistakable thunder of high explosive could be heard a few kilometers away – the smoke rises among the minarets of a nearby Ottoman-era mosque. No one seemed to notice.
“You actually get used to it after a while,” said George, an IT technician from a coastal town. “But you never know exactly what they’re hitting.” That usually becomes evident after video clips posted by opposition media on YouTube.
The sinister background noise is doubly disturbing because the government strives both to preserve an air of leisure as usual. “As you can see, everything here is fine, but we have to attack the terrorists, these extremists,” an army officer announced. One official, whose return route has been attacked by rebels in Daraya, said: “If I were afraid, I would just close the door and stay inside. I have to work and I'm not afraid. If I don't defend my country, who will?
Common citizens, in private conversation, are less challenging. In the center of the city, a shopkeeper sadly complained that his little girl was crying over the sound of the bombings. Zeina, a 20 - year - old student, fears that suffering will become desensitized, and perhaps also dangerous. “At first, when there were explosions, I used to have nightmares,” he reflected. Now I can sleep with anything.
And, the risks multiply even closer to home. In Sabaa Bahrat Square, in what was supposed to be the safest part of Damascus, detonated a car bomb, leaving a blackened concrete facade, broken windows and shattered metal, as well as damage to the imposing structure of the Syrian Central Bank next door. The mourning notices for two of the 15 victims – Muhammad al-Sufi and Manal al-Tahan – are attached to the opposite wall. Militians machine guns and machine gun shrapnel grind around the square, often used for televised pro-regime rallies with public officials on mass bus to chant slogans under the giant flags of President Bashar al-Assad.
That bombing was not the worst Damascus has ever experienced, as the situation has deteriorated. In February, 80 people, including schoolchildren, reportedly died near the Baath party headquarters in Mazraa. The crater remains visible, marked by a huge piece of fresh asphalt on the main road heading north. “I live nearby, but fortunately I wasn’t there,” Munir, a university professor, recalled.
The mortar bombs, fired from rebel-controlled areas now inside the easy-to-reach area of the city, have become a sinister novelty. The bombs killed 15 students in a university cafeteria on March 28. The intended target was believed to be a government building.
Security measures have intensified since the devastating bombing of the national security crisis cell in July 2012, when four of Assad's most important assistants were killed. The explosive concrete barriers, often painted in black, red and white from the Syrian flag, now protect official premises, not just military or defence installations that are obvious targets. The Iranian embassy in Mezze, its turquoise mosaic forehead that takes an exotic look at Isfahan or Shiraz, looks like a fortress. “The regime managed to mount a steel ring around Damascus,” said a foreign diplomat. “But for whatever reason the perimeter is beginning to be pierced and that brings home the reality of the war.”
All this means that moving has become difficult, unpredictable and time-consuming – another aspect of the new normality in an understandably nervous city. Control points in the funnel traffic of main roads for identification controls and luggage search with portable explosive detectors – vital to stop future bombers. Only drivers with an official safety clearance can use special fast lanes to avoid waiting.
It is difficult, however, to avoid the question in everyone’s mind: will there be a battle for Damascus – the world’s continually inhabited city, as the guides say – as it has damaged Aleppo so much? Some parts of the city already feel like a war zone: their most ritzier hotel is strangely deserted, although many rooms are being used as offices by international agencies drawn by the deep crisis – blue helmets and bullet-proof jackets piled on Persian carpets in a decorated reception room, white UN vehicles parked behind the blast barriers on the outside. The streets are empty shortly after 21:00.
One view is that the fight for the capital of Syria is coming, but not yet – in the summer perhaps, some predict, when the rebels have consolidated their profits in the south. Others argue that it is unlikely that either side will win an absolute victory and expect a political solution imposed from abroad. But few here seem to expect things to get better.

"As “rationalism” and “empiricism”, “existenceism” is a term that belongs to intellectual history. Therefore, its definition is to some extent of historical convenience. The term was explicitly adopted as a self-description by Jean-Paul Sartre, and through the wide dissemination of the post-war literary and philosophical production of Sartre and his associates, in particular Simone de Beauvoir, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Albert Camus, existentialism was identified with a cultural movement that flourished in Europe in the 1940s and 1950s. Among the main philosophers identified as existentialists (many of whom – for example Camus and Heidegger – repudiated the label) were Karl Jaspers, Martin Heidegger and Martin Buber in Germany, Jean Wahl and Gabriel Marcel in France, the Spanish José Ortega y Gasset and Miguel de Unamuno, and the Russians Nikolai Berdyaev and Lev Shestov. 19th-century philosophers, Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche, became seen as pioneers of the movement. Existentialism was both a literary and philosophical phenomenon. Sartre's own ideas were and are better known through his fictional works (such as Nausea and No Exit) than through his most purely philosophical (such as Being and Nothing and Critique of Dialectic Reason), and the post-war years found a very diverse collection of writers and artists linked under the term: retrospectively, Dostoevsky, Ibsen and Kafka were recruited; in Paris there were Jean Genet, André Gide, André Malraux, and expatriate Samuel Beckett; the Norwegian Knut Hamsun and Romanian Eugene Ionesco belong to the club; artists such as Alberto Giacometti and even abstract expressionists such as Jackson Pollock, Arshile Gorky, and Willem de Kooning, and filmmakers such as Jean-Luc Godard and Ingmar Bergman were understood in existential terms. By the mid-1970s the cultural image of existentialism had become a cliché, parodized in countless Woody Allen books and films. [1]
Therefore, it is sometimes suggested that existentialism is simply this past cultural movement rather than an identifiable philosophical position; or, alternatively, that the term should be restricted to Sartre's philosophy only. [2] Two recent books, both sustained attempts to engage critically and constructively with existentialism in the context of contemporary philosophical debates, adopt versions of these positions. Jonathan Webber argues that “as originally defined by Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre, existentialism is the ethical theory that we must treat freedom at the centre of human existence as intrinsically valuable and the foundation of all other values” (2018: 2). If we stick to this definition, we can both recognize the fissures within what is called “existentialism” in the expansive sense and also see how existentialism can “found sophisticated contributions to social psychology, the philosophy of the mind, moral philosophy, cultural theory and psychotherapy” (2018: 19). Taking the other stance, Noreen Khawaja points to the perennial difficulty of specifying precisely who is supposed to belong to the “movement” of existentialism, since the term itself was unknown to some who are recruited or rejected by others. But, he argues, this is a problem only if existentialism is considered a movement. Although aspects of such a movement can be found in the historical record, existentialism itself “is a tradition, not a movement,” that is, “a pattern of intergenerational influence, in which later figures read and appropriated the work of earlier figures” (Khawaja 2016: 4). What encourages this tradition — exemplified here by Kierkegaard, Heidegger and Sartre — is its struggle against religion and the fact that the writing of even the so-called existentialists “atheistics” “feels religious to their readers” (2016: 16). Interestingly, either of the two positions leads to the same place: For Khawaja, “the idea of personal authenticity is at the center of existential thought” (2016: 24), while for Webber, the existentialism of Sartre, Beauvoir and Franz Fanon begins with “the eudaimonist arguments for the virtue of authenticity” and finally affirms “a categorical moral imperative of authenticity” (2018: 19).
In this entry, I will use elements of both approaches. Like Khawaja, I consider existentialism to be a usefully broad term in intellectual history that can illuminate the work of philosophers and others who preceded the emergence of “movement” or rejected the label. In this sense, “existentialism” chooses a distinct group of philosophical problems and a relatively different current of philosophical research from the 20th century and now from the 21st century, one that has had a significant impact on fields such as theology (through Rudolf Bultmann, Paul Tillich, Karl Barth and others) and psychology (from Ludwig Binswanger and Medard Boss to Otto Rank, R. D. Laing and Viktor Frankl). On the other hand, I do not believe that the “tradition” of existential thought should be addressed exclusively in terms of the (very real) struggle with religion that gives some of the works of existential philosophy a religious “feel” (see Westphal 2012). I agree with Webber that there is a core of philosophical content (category) to existential thinking that can be understood regardless of the type of religious “retoration” (Khawaja 2016: 16) characteristic of many of the classics of existentialism. Unlike Webber, however, I believe that this categorical content is widely shared—beyond Sartre, Beauvoir and Fanon—and should be understood as based on the phenomenological approach that Sartre is so excited about (see Crowell 2012b). The phenomenological approach gave philosophical form to the basic existential insight that thought about human existence requires new categories not found in the conceptual repertoire of ancient or modern thought; human beings cannot be understood either as substances with fixed properties, or as subjects interacting with a world of objects.
From an existential point of view, to understand what a human being is, it is not enough to know all the truths that natural science, including the science of psychology, could tell us. The dualist who holds that humans are composed of independent substances — “mind” and “body” — is no better in this regard than the physicist who holds that human existence can be adequately explained in terms of the fundamental physical constituents of the universe. Existentialism does not deny the validity of the basic categories of physics, biology, psychology and other sciences (categories such as matter, causality, force, function, organism, development, motivation, etc.). He only states that human beings cannot be fully understood in terms of them. Nor can such understanding be obtained by complementing our scientific picture with a moral one. Categories of moral theory such as intention, guilt, responsibility, character, duty, virtue, etc. They capture important aspects of the human condition, but neither moral thought (ruled by the norms of good and law) nor scientific thought (ruled by the norm of truth) are sufficient.
Therefore, ""existentialism"" can be defined as the philosophical theory that holds that a new set of categories, governed by the norm of authenticity, is necessary to understand human existence. Addressing existentialism in this categorical way may seem to conceal what is often considered its “heart” (Kaufmann 1968: 12), namely its character as a gesture of protest against academic philosophy, its anti-system sensitivity, its flight from the “iron cage” of reason. But while it is true that the great existential philosophers wrote with passion and urgency something infrequent in our time, and while the idea that philosophy cannot be practiced in the selfless manner of an objective science is in fact central to existentialism, it is equally true that all topics popularly associated with existentialism — reading, boredom, alienation, absurdity, freedom, compromise, nothingness, etc. — find their philosophical meaning in the context of the search for a new categorical framework, along with their rule of government.",C2
"The world war on drugs has failed, a high-level commission composed of former presidents, public intellectuals and other leaders studying drug policies concluded in a report published on Thursday.
International efforts to suppress drug producers and users and seek to reduce demand have had devastating consequences for people and societies around the world, the report of the World Commission on Drug Policy said.
The commission, which includes former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the founder of the Virgin Richard Branson Group and Nobel Laureate Mario Vargas Llosa, challenges conventional wisdom on drug markets and drug use.
Among the recommendations of the group:
- Ending the criminalization and stigmatization of people who use drugs but do not harm others
-- Encourage Governments to experiment with the legalization of drugs, especially marijuana
-- Provide more harm reduction measures, such as access to syringes
- Ditch has just said no and zero tolerance policies for young people in favour of other educational efforts.
The theory that increasing police action would lead to an increasingly reduced drug market has not worked, says the report. On the contrary, the illegal drug markets and organized criminal organizations that traffic them have grown, the group found.
The report comes as countries like Mexico suffer from widespread drug-related violence. More than 40,000 people have been killed in Mexico in the past four years as rival cartels fight each other for lucrative smugglers and as the army fights against cartels.
The Commission's conclusions add more high-profile voices to a growing movement calling for a radical approach to drugs. Other leaders, such as former Mexican President Vicente Fox, have called for the legalization of drugs as part of a solution to their country's problems.

"Clashes near Mali's northern city of Kidal between government forces and armed rebel groups Tuareg have left eight Malian soldiers dead and 25 others injured, the country's Ministry of Defence, the state newspaper L'Essor National, reported on Sunday.
There were also 28 dead and 62 wounded on the Tuareg side, the ministry said, according to L'Essor National.
The government issued a statement on Saturday saying that Tuareg rebels from the Azawad National Liberation Movement, along with jihadists, attacked government buildings.
The Azawad National Liberation Movement -- known as the MNLA, the initials of its name in French -- is fighting for independence from the northern part of Mali, a region referred to as Azawad.
The MNLA issued a statement on violence, describing it as self-defense and resistance.
The group claimed to have taken 30 prisoners, including 24 soldiers and three regional government officials. Two wounded Malian soldiers were handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross, MNLA added.
The United Nations Mission in Mali condemned the clashes and stated that they violated the preliminary agreements aimed at achieving peace and security in the northern regions, including in Kidal.

"SeaWorld has suffered an 84% collapse in profits as customers have abandoned the controversial water theme park company after claiming that they mistreated whales orca.
The company, which trains dolphins and killer whales to perform tricks in front of stadiums full of spectators, has reported decreases in attendance, sales and profits due to “continuous brand challenges”.
SeaWorld has been on the headlines since the 2013 Blackfish documentary detailing claims that its treatment of whales caused violent behavior, contributing to the deaths of three people. After the documentary was published, attendance collapsed, the company lost more than half of its market value on Wall Street and its former CEO was expelled.
Since then, the company has launched a national marketing campaign to combat animal rights activists claims that, among other things, captive whales die at a younger age than their wild counterparts.
Despite cutting ticket prices and spending $10 million on marketing bombing, which has its whale-care veterinarians, SeaWorld CEO Joel Manby was forced to admit that the company is still struggling to convince the public that it treats its whales well.
“We realize that we have a lot of work ahead of us to recover more from our support base, increase revenue and improve our performance, as going back to historical performance levels will take time and investment,” Manby said. “On the reputation side, early feedback on our campaign has been positive. However, we recognize that the complete resolution of our brand challenges in California will require a sustained approach and commitment to correct misinformation.”
“We will continue to fight the facts because the facts are on our side,” he said recently in a telephone conference with journalists and analysts.
Manby, who joined the company as CEO in 2015 to help the company rehabilitate, said he will present his vision for the company's future at a special event on November 6. Plans for a new shark exhibition in Orlando and an attraction in San Antonio are already underway that will allow customers to swim with dolphins in a “naturalistic” environment.
The company's financial report, published on August 6, showed that net revenue in the second quarter fell from $37.4 million in 2014 to $5.8 million in 2015, a decrease of 84%. Income decreased from $405 million to $392 million. Assistance decreased by more than 100,000 people, from 6.58 million to 6.48 million. Analysts will now be watching SeaWorld's sales and attendance numbers closely in the third quarter, which is traditionally the company's most profitable and covers the summer holiday season.
The assistance may suffer a new scandal in July 2015, in which a SeaWorld employee would have infiltrated animal rights protest groups against the company. Jared Goodman, Animal Law Director at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), who has been running campaigns against SeaWorld, said: “SeaWorld is in the middle of a spying scandal, animals are dying in its tanks and tens of thousands of people have opposed its attempt to build a new orca prison, so it should not be surprising that SeaWorld’s quarterly revenue has plummeted once again in the second quarter. Families simply don’t want to buy tickets to watch the orcas go crazy inside small tanks and SeaWorld profits, like the orcas, won’t recover until the abuse park emptys its tanks and builds coastal sanctuaries.”
The shares of SeaWorld, which were worth $39 in 2013, were changing hands for just under $18 in August 2015.

"The idea that science is a collective enterprise of researchers in successive generations is characteristic of the Modern Age (Nisbet 1980). The classical empiricists (Francis Bacon) and the 17th-century rationalists (René Descartes) urged that the use of appropriate research methods ensure the discovery and justification of new truths. This cumulative view of scientific progress was an important ingredient in the optimism of the 18th-century Enlightenment, and was incorporated in Auguste Comte's positivism program in the 1830s: by accumulating empirically certified truths science also promotes progress in society. Other influential trends in the 19th century included the romantic view of organic growth in culture, Hegel's dynamic account of historical change and the theory of evolution. They all inspired epistemological views (for example, between Marxists and pragmatists) that viewed human knowledge as a process. Philosophers with an interest in the history of science (William Whewell, Charles Peirce, Ernst Mach, Pierre Duhem) gave interesting analyses of some aspects of scientific change.
At the beginning of the 20th century, the analytical philosophers of science began to apply modern logic to the study of science. His main focus was the structure of scientific theories and patterns of inference (Suppe 1977). This “synchronous” research of the “finished products” of scientific activities was questioned by philosophers who wanted to pay serious attention to the “diachronic” study of scientific change. These contributions include N.R. Hanson’s Patterns of Discovery (1958), Karl Popper’s The Logic of Scientific Discovery (1959) and Conjects and Resurrections (1963), Thomas Kuhn’s The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962), Paul Feyerabend’s incommensurable thesis (Feyerabend 1962), Imre Lakatos’s methodology of scientific research programmes (Lakatos and Musgrave 1970) and Larry Laudan’s Progress and Is Problems (1977). Darwinist models of evolutionary epistemology were defended by Popper's objective knowledge: an evolutionary approach (1972) and Stephen Toulmin's human understanding (1972). These works challenged the vision received on the development of scientific knowledge and rationality. Popper's falsificationism, Kuhn's account of scientific revolutions, and Feyerabend's thesis of meaning variance shared the view that science does not grow simply by accumulating new established truths about old ones. Except perhaps during the periods of Kuhn's normal science, theoretical change is not cumulative or continuous: the earlier results of science will be rejected, replaced and reinterpreted by new theories and conceptual frameworks. Popper and Kuhn differed, however, in their definitions of progress: the former appealed to the idea that successive theories may approach the truth, while the latter characterized progress in terms of the problem-solving capacity of theories.
Since the mid-1970s, numerous philosophical works have been published on the themes of change, development and progress of science (Harré 1975; Stegmüller 1976; Howson 1976; Rescher 1978; Radnitzky and Andersson 1978, 1979; Niiniluto and Tuomela 1979; Dilworth 1981; Smith 1981; Hacking 1981; Schäfer 1983; Niiniluoto 1984; Laudan 1984a; Rescher 1984; Pitt 1985; Radnitzky and Bartley 1987; Callebaut and Pinxten 1987; Balzer et al. 1987; Hull 1988; Gavroglu et al. 1989; Kitcher 1993; Pera 1994; Chang 2004; Maxwell 2017). These studies have also led to many important developments that are added to the toolbox of the philosophers of science. One of them is the systematic study of intertheoretical relationships, such as reduction (Balzer et al. 1984; Pearce 1987; Balzer 2000; Jonkisz 2000; Hoyningen-Huene and Sankey 2001), correspondence (Krajewski 1977; Nowak 1980; Pearce and Rantala 1984; Nowakowa and Nowak 2000; Rantala 2002), and review of beliefs (Gärdenfors, 1988; Aliseda, 2006). Another was the recognition that, in addition to individual statements and theories, it is also necessary to consider the temporary development of units of activity and scientific achievements: normal science led by Kuhn paradigms, Lakatos' research program, Laudan's research tradition, the dynamic evolution of Wolfgang Stegmüller's theory (1976), Philip Kitcher's consensus practice (1993). A new tool used in many realistic points of view defenses of scientific progress (Niniluoto 1980, 2014; Aronson, Harré and Way 1994; Kuipers 2000, 2019) is the notion of likelihood or likelihood (Popper 1963, 1970).
The keen interest in the development of science promoted close cooperation between historians and philosophers of science. For example, case studies of historical examples (e.g., the substitution of Newton's classical mechanics by quantum theory and the theory of relativity) have inspired many philosophical treatments of scientific revolutions. Historical case studies were important for philosophers who began studying scientific discovery (Hanson 1958; Nickles 1980). Historically oriented philosophers have shown how instruments and measurements have promoted the progress of physics and chemistry (Chang 2004). Experimental psychologists have argued that the search for broad and simple explanations shapes learning and inference (Lombrozo 2016). Another interesting material for philosophical discussions on scientific progress is provided by quantitative approaches in the study of the growth of scientific publications (from Solla Price 1963; Rescher 1978) and scientific indicators (Elkana et al. 1978). Sociologists of science have studied the dynamic interaction between the scientific community and other social institutions. With their influence, philosophers have analyzed the role of social and cultural values in the development of science (Longino 2002). One of the favorite themes of sociologists has been the emergence of new scientific specialties (Mulkay 1975; Niiniluoto 1995b). Sociologists are also concerned about the pragmatic problem of progress: how best to organize research activities to promote scientific progress. In this way, models of scientific change are relevant to scientific policy issues (Böhme 1977; Schäfer 1983).",C2
"Chinese regulators have hit the online discount retailer Vipshop Holdings Ltd with a fine of 3 million yuan ($464,000), the largest to date in a recent crackdown on anticompetitive behaviour among Internet companies.
In a sign that regulators are increasingly willing to use more tools in a new zeal to curb monopolistic behavior in the technology sector, Vipshop was punished for violations of a law prohibiting unfair competition, which allows fines of up to 5 million yuan.
By comparison, other companies that have been fined since the end of last year were fined under China's antitrust law of 2008, which allows for a maximum fine of much less than 500,000 yuan.
The Vipshop fine comes immediately after the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) issued updated guidelines on how the antitrust law affects Internet companies, who said regulators were willing to avoid pricing, as well as the use of data and algorithms to manipulate the market.
SAMR said on Monday that from August to December last year, Vipshop had developed a system for obtaining brand information that gave Vipshop a competitive advantage. He added that Vipshop used its system to influence users' options, transaction opportunities and to block sales of certain brands.
Vipshop, which has a market value of about $22 billion, said Monday that it accepted the findings of SAMR and would strengthen compliance.
The increased scrutiny by Chinese regulators since December has included the announcement of an investigation into the Alibaba e-commerce giant, penalizing Alibaba-backed and Tencent-backed companies for not seeking antitrust reviews for the agreements, while other companies have also been fined for irregular prices.",C2
"Federal officials said that more needs to be done on Thursday to warn rescuers of special hazards at the scene of small plane crashes.
While firefighters are well aware of the dangers of burning fuel and sharp debris, they may not know that some aviation systems -- systems that are considered air safety devices -- become particularly dangerous on the ground. Among the hazards: ejection seat rockets, airbag components and explosive charges that deploy parachutes that can lower the entire aircraft to the ground.
These explosive components, if they remain loaded and are unknown to the first responders and investigators, pose a high level of risk to those working inside and around the remains of the aircraft, said the National Transportation Safety Board.
The safety board cited five incidents since 2001 in which the first responders and accident investigators who responded to aircraft wrecks were clearly unaware of the danger of explosive components.
In some cases, they began to carry out rescue, firefighting and accident investigation activities that could have inadvertently activated the explosive component, posing a high risk of injury, the safety board said. None resulted in the death or injury of the responders.
In one incident, the fatal accident of January 2012 of an experimental plane near Rainbow City, Alabama, a police officer realized the hidden dangers only after a NTSB investigator told him on the phone not to allow the pilot's remains to be recovered until the pilot's expulsion seat could be deactivated. In another incident, firefighters attempting to set fire to a Cirrus SR22 accident took additional safety precautions after the aircraft was told that it had a BRS, a solid fuel rocket used to deploy the aircraft's parachute.
NTSB recommends that the Federal Aviation Administration take additional measures to address the issue of safety. The FAA should require aircraft owners to disclose the presence of explosive safety devices when they register their aircraft every three years. Online registration is easily available for the first responders, said the NTSB.
The FAA should also issue a safety bulletin to the first responders, the board recommended.
FAA said it will review the recommendations. We have collaborated with ballistic device manufacturers, aircraft manufacturers, firefighting organizations and other first aid groups to develop training on potential hazards in an accident scene and to ensure that warning marks comply with the necessary guidelines, FAA said in a statement.

"Coal is likely to rival oil as the world’s largest energy source in the next five years, with potentially disastrous climate consequences, according to the world’s leading energy economy authority.
One of the major factors behind the increase in coal use has been the massive increase in shale gas use in the United States.
Further research by the International Energy Agency (IEA) shows that coal consumption is increasing worldwide, even in countries and regions with carbon reduction targets, except in the United States, where shale gas has displaced coal. The decline in coal consumption in the US has helped to reduce coal prices globally. This has made it more attractive, even in Europe, where the use of coal was supposed to be discouraged by the emissions trading scheme.
Maria van der Hoeven, Executive Director of the IEA, said: “The share of coal in the global energy mix continues to grow every year and, if no change is made in current policies, coal will capture oil in a decade.”
Coal is abundant and found in most regions of the world, unlike conventional oil and gas, and can be extracted cheaply. As a result, coal was used to meet almost half of the increase in global energy demand over the past decade. According to the IEA, demand from China and India will boost coal use in the world over the next five years, and India will likely outperform the United States as the world's second-largest consumer. China is the largest importer of coal, and Indonesia is the largest exporter, temporarily surpassing Australia.
According to the IEA’s Medium-Term Coal Market Report, the world will burn 1.2 billion tons more of coal per year by 2017 compared to today, the equivalent of current combined coal consumption in Russia and the United States. Global coal consumption is expected to reach 4.3 billion tonnes of oil equivalent in 2017, while oil consumption is expected to reach 4.4 billion tonnes on the same date.
With the highest carbon emissions from any major fossil fuel, coal contributes enormously to climate change, especially when burned in outdated and inefficient power plants. When these are not equipped with special scrabbing equipment to eliminate chemicals, coal can also produce sulphur emissions – the main cause of acid rain – and other pollutants such as mercury and soot particles.
Van der Hoeven said that, without high carbon prices to discourage growth in coal use and promote cleaner technologies such as renewable energy generation, only competition from lower-priced gas could realistically reduce coal demand. This has happened in the United States, due to the extraordinary increase in shale gas production in that market over the past five years.
He said: “The experience of the United States suggests that a more efficient gas market, characterized by flexible prices and fueled by unconventional indigenous resources that are produced in a sustainable manner, can reduce coal use, carbon dioxide emissions and consumers’ electricity bills. Europe, China and other regions should take note.”
That would mean producing much more shale gas, as conventional gas resources are being depleted in their easy-to-access locations.
In Europe, the emissions trading scheme was supposed to discourage high-carbon energy generation by imposing a price on carbon dioxide emissions. This was done through the issuance of generators and energy-intensive companies with an established quota of emission permits, which required them to purchase additional permits if they needed to issue more than their allocation. But an over-allocation, coupled with the effects of the financial crisis and recession, has led to a large surplus of permits on the market, which in turn has led to a fall in permit prices. At current levels, a few euros per tonne of carbon, there is little incentive to look for lower carbon fuels, and coal is enjoying a renaissance in Europe.
This means that one of the only global market regulatory mechanisms aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions is failing in its key objectives. The world faces the likelihood of a higher risk of climate change as a result of this uncontrolled consumption of higher carbon fossil fuel.

"The very concept of a “non-existent object” has an air of paradox in this regard, at least for those philosophers whose thinking is rooted in the Humean tradition. For Hume suggested that thinking of an object is always and necessarily thinking of an existing object, or to put it differently, that thinking of an object and thinking of the same object that exists are just one and the same thing. Immanuel Kant resumed Hume's idea and affirmed that existence is not a ""real preaching,"" an affirmation that is often interpreted as an anticipation of Gottlob Frege's famous doctrine that existence is not a preaching of individuals. (See Hume 2000, Book 1, Part 2, Sec. 6; Kant 2003, B 627; Frege 1966, pp. 37f.) Kant’s motivation to reject the view that existence is a “real preaching” was the so-called “ontological proof” of God’s existence, which says, more or less, that God’s perfection implies the existence of God, for a being who would have all the perfections of God except existence (i.e. omniscience, omnipotence, benevolence) would be less perfect than a being with the same perfections plus existence. For centuries, philosophers have felt that there is something wrong with this test, but Kant was the first to point out a possible error: he argued that the error of the “ontological argument” lies in the treatment of existence as “a real predicate.”
If Hume is right, then the concept of an object includes the concept of existence, and the concept of a non-existent object would be as contradictory as the concept of a round square. If existence is not a predicate of individuals, then one might assume that it is not non-existence either. Therefore, if Frege is right, to say of an object that is non-existent is a kind of nonsense that arises from a violation of logical grammar. (For Frege and those who follow him, an affirmation like ""God exists/does not exist"" must be understood as an affirmation about the concept of God, or about the property of being God. In this view, the logical form of ""God exists"" does not exist (God)—where he exists is a predicate of individuals, but rather: The concept of God applies to something, or something possesses the property of being God.)
Thus, to take seriously the idea of non-existent objects, one must renounce the views of important philosophers on the nature of existence and adopt the view that existence is some kind of preaching of individuals. This view implies, among other things, that saying, for example, that there are some white elephants is to say that some white elephants have the property of existence (or, to put it another way, that not all white elephants are non-existent)—a consequence that could affect some as strange.
Moreover, in order to affirm that “there are non-existent objects” without implying that “there are non-existent objects”, it must be assumed that sentences in the form “There are Fs” mean something different from sentences in the form “There are Fs”. [1] Some philosophers reject a distinction between ""there is"" and ""there is"" (see, for example, Lewis 1990, Priest 2005, Quine 1953), some philosophers (for example, Meinong 1960, Parsons 1980, Zalta 1988) think that there are good reasons to make this distinction. Some of the latter think that the distinction between “there is” and “there is” is rooted in ordinary language, but others firmly deny it (see, for example, Geach 1971). Obviously, although there might be a tendency among competent English speakers to use “there is” and “there is” in different contexts, the use of ordinary language is too hesitant and not uniform in this sense to be a stable ground for philosophical theory. Of course, this does not exclude that there are theoretical reasons to distinguish between “exist” and “exist”, some of which are discussed below.",C2
"Planned Parenthood in New York City shattered the city's new teenage pregnancy prevention campaign on Thursday, saying it doesn't deter teenage pregnancy and that it inappropriately shames and stigmatizes its target audience.
The campaign creates stigma, hostility and negative public opinions about teenage pregnancy and parenthood rather than offering alternative aspirations for young people, said Haydee Morales, vice president of education and training of the organization. The city's money would be better spent on helping adolescents access health care, birth control and high-quality sexual and reproductive health education, not on an advertising campaign aimed at creating shock value.
The New York City Human Resources Administration/Department of Social Services announced the $400,000 initiative, which includes photos of babies delivering messages to their hypothetical parents as honestly, Mom... it's likely that she won't stay with you. What's wrong with me? The small print adds that 90% of teenage parents do not marry.
Dad, you'll pay to keep me for the next 20 years, says another one of the ads, which adds in smaller print than New York State law requires a parent to pay maintenance until a child turns 21.
You got a good job? It costs thousands of dollars each year, says another, adding that teenage parents should expect to spend more than $10,000 a year to raise their child.
Teenagers who give birth before they are ready to provide emotional and financial support are not a good way to raise children, said Administration Commissioner Robert Doar. We cannot dictate how people live their lives, and sometimes even the best plans don't work, but we must foster responsibility and send the right message, especially to young people.
Planned Parenthood, a advocacy group and provider of reproductive health and education services, said Wednesday in a statement that advertisements spread stereotypes and do not address social problems leading to teenage pregnancies.
A city spokesperson defended the ads, calling them only part of a larger initiative that will include an interactive campaign of text messages and social networks and a public service video ad on YouTube.
This campaign is part of the city's comprehensive adolescent pregnancy prevention program, which includes sex education, increased access to birth control, and partnerships with community organizations, said Samantha Levine, deputy press secretary to Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
The city has a school education program in which teenage mothers and fathers discuss with their peers the challenges of raising a child. A State family planning benefit programme covers reproductive and sexual health care, including contraceptives, for adolescents and low-income adults.
And a city-wide relationship abuse prevention program exposes the consequences of teenage pregnancy and how to avoid peer pressure and coercion.
Since 2011, the city has ordered comprehensive sex education in public schools.
The pregnancy rate of women in the city has decreased by 27% in the last decade, but it remains higher than the national average, according to the mayor's office, which launched the campaign on Monday.
Daughters of teenage fathers are more likely to become teenage mothers, while children are more likely to go to jail, he said in a statement. On the other hand, parents who finish high school, find full-time work and get married before having children have a 98% chance of not living in poverty.
Planned Parenthood said it supports initiatives and recognizes the importance of awareness-raising and education, but added that the rate of teenage pregnancies is affected by economic and social factors such as poverty, violence, limited access to health care, as well as gender, racial and ethnic inequalities.
Adolescent parenthood is not simply the disastrous and life-threatening event that these ads portray, he said. It is time for us to focus on the root causes instead of pointing fingers at teenage parents and their children.
Last year, Bloomberg promised a $250,000 gift to the Family Planning Federation of America after the Susan G. Komen Foundation in Cure cut the Planned Parenthood breast cancer screening grants. Subsequently, the foundation reversed its decision.
According to data collected by the National Campaign to Prevent Teenage Pregnancy and not planned in its 2012 publication, Why It Matters: Teen Childbeing, Education, and Economic Wellbeing, approximately 48% of mothers aged 15-19 lived below the poverty line.
As their children grow, their likelihood of living in poverty increases according to Jessica Sheets Pika, spokesperson for the organization.
About 41 per cent of women who gave birth before age 20 lived in poverty during the first year of their child's birth, while the chances of living in poverty increased to 50 per cent when their child reached 3, Pika said.

"Digitized material piles – from blogs, tweets, photos and videos to official documents such as court decisions and emails – can be lost forever because the programs needed to see them will become dead, the vice president of Google warned. The first steps of humanity in the digital world could be lost to future historians, Vint Cerf told the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in San Jose, California, warning that we are facing a “forgotten generation or even a forgotten century” through what he called “bit-podication,” where old computer files become useless rubbish.
Cerf called for the development of “digital vellum” to preserve old software and hardware so that outdated files can be recovered no matter how old they are. “When you think about the amount of documentation of our daily life that is captured in digital form, such as our email interactions, people’s tweets and the entire global network, it’s clear that we’re standing to lose a lot of our history,” he said. “We don’t want our digital lives to disappear. If we want to preserve them, we need to make sure that the digital objects we create today can still be rendered in the future,” he added.
What is 'bit rotting' and is Vint Cerf right to be worried? Being able to access digital content in the coming decades could be less of a problem than one of the ""Internet parents"" has involved. The warning highlights an irony in the heart of modern technology, where music, photos, letters and other documents are digitized in the hope of ensuring their long-term survival. But while researchers are making progress in storing digital files for centuries, the programs and hardware needed to make sense of the files are continually out of use.
“We are unreservedly throwing all our data into what could become a black hole of information without realizing it. We digitize things because we think we will keep them, but what we don’t understand is that, unless we take other steps, those digital versions may not be better, and even worse, than the artifacts we digitize,” says Cerf. “If there are pictures you really care about, print them out.”
Ancient civilizations did not suffer such problems because stories written in cuneiformes on baked clay tablets or papyrus rolls only needed eyes to read them. To study the current culture, future scholars would be confronted with PDFs, Word documents and hundreds of other types of files that can only be interpreted with dedicated software and sometimes hardware, too.
The problem is already here. In the 1980s, it was routine to save documents on floppy disks, upload Jet Set Willy from cassette to the ZX spectrum, kill aliens with a Quickfire II joystick and have Atari game cartridges in the attic. Even if the discs and cassettes are in good condition, the equipment needed for their operation is now mostly only in museums.
The rise of the game has its own place in the history of digital culture, but Cerf warns that important political and historical documents will also be lost to rot. In 2005, American historian Doris Kearns Goodwin wrote Team of Rivals: the Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln, describing how Lincoln hired those who ran against him for the presidency. She went to libraries around the U.S., found the physical letters of the people involved, and rebuilt her conversations. “In today’s world, those letters would be emails and the chances of finding them will fade very small within a hundred years,” Cerf said.
He acknowledged that historians would take steps to preserve material considered important according to current standards, but maintained that the importance of documents and correspondence was often not fully appreciated until hundreds of years later. Historians have learned how the greatest mathematician of antiquity considered the concept of infinity and anticipated calculus in 3BC after the Archimedes palimpsest was found hidden under the words of a 13th-century Byzantine prayer book. “We have been surprised by what we have learned from objects that have been purely preserved by chance that give us a vision of an earlier civilization,” he said.
Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh have advanced towards a solution for bit rot, or at least partial. There, Mahadev Satyanarayanan takes digital snapshots of computer hard drives while running different software programs. These can be uploaded to a computer that mimics the software that worked. The result is a computer that can read files that would otherwise disappear. Under a project called Olive, researchers have archived Mystery House, the original 1982 graphic adventure game for Apple II, an early version of WordPerfect, and Doom, the original 1993 first person shooting game.
But inventing new technologies is only half the battle. Even more difficult could be browsing legal permissions to copy and store software before it dies. When IT companies get out of business, or stop supporting their products, they can sell the rights, so it's a nightmare task to get approval. “To do this correctly, preservation rights may have to be incorporated into our thinking about things like copyright and patents and licenses. We are talking about preserving them for hundreds or thousands of years,” Cerf said.

"The Spinoza Letters are a cumbersome work, their disjointed composition indicates the haste with which it was created. The first edition opens with the text of a poem by Goethe which, however, was abandoned in the second edition. The poem bore the name of its author, but had been edited mechanically by Jacobi to remove, printing certain key phrases in relief, images especially important to him. Thus edited, the poem conveyed the idea that pagan gods are the man written great, and therefore should be praised, as they reveal what is nobler in man. Brute nature has no feelings or discernment, while humans can judge, make distinctions and dare the impossible. They transcend nature. This was a humanist message with which Jacobi wholeheartedly agreed. After a brief explanation of how the exchange of letters with Mendelssohn originated, the main text continues with a somewhat abbreviated version of the correspondence itself. The first letter reported Jacobi’s conversation with Lessing on the subject of Spinoza during his visit to Wolfenbüttel, and included the text of another poem by Goethe — the Prometheus, which had been the occasion of the conversation in the first place. This poem, hitherto unpublished, was printed without the author's name (some thought it was Jacobi himself) and transmitted a quite different image of the gods found in the other poem. He suggested that they, no less than mortal men, are subject to the blind ‘almighty time’ that rules over all. In such a universe governed by the ""eternal destiny"", they are, therefore, even more miserable than human beings, since the latter have at least the power to rebel against the order of things and thus preserve their dignity. At least as Prometheus typifies it, humans can rejoice in their own sufferings, and for this challenge sustain their individuality before destiny.
In the rest of the letters we see Mendelssohn trying to downplay Lessing's supposed admission to spinozy. Since Mendelssohn initially thought that Jacobi himself was a spinozist, we also see him attacking the basic doctrines of spinozism as he understood them, while at the same time suggesting how they could be reformulated in a more internally consistent way to be reincorporated into the accepted teachings of school metaphysics. Jacobi, for his part, intended to show his scholarly (and indeed more accurate) knowledge of Spinoza's philosophy. In response to Mendelssohn's criticism of Spinoza, he argued that spinozism represented, on the contrary, a perfectly self-consisting position. It was school metaphysics that would logically lead to spinozism, if its implications were fully understood, not the other way around. Jacobi also gave an explanation for his sudden decision to publish the letters. Since Mendelssohn had announced the imminent publication of his Morgenstunden,[5] a book in which, as Mendelssohn said, he would address the subject of spinozism, Jacobi thought his opponent was unfairly trying to make a public advantage in a controversy that was agreed he would have to remain private before being called to public attention by mutual consent. Jacobi then concluded the book with extensive rambling quotes from various theologians, and sealed it' (his expression) with an extract from Lavater.
Mendelssohn bitterly complained to Kant that Jacobi's volume was like a monster deporting Goethe to the head, Spinoza as torso, and Lavater for the feet. There was a point in his complaint. However, in spite of the many ramblings and the penetrating preaching tone of the text, there was a definite philosophical message that Jacobi was transmitting. Philosophers are temperamentally inclined to reconstruct reality according to the requirements of explanation, in total ignorance of the requirements of existence. They are possessed, so to speak, by a logical fanaticism that leads them to confuse the abstract principles of explaining the principles of existence. Since the individuality of things is the first victim of this confusion, however, individuality is the necessary condition of all existence, it follows that in the world, rebuilt by philosophers, there is no room for truly existing subjects, let alone for agents who can seriously assume responsibility for their actions and relate to each other as a person to person, a “I” to a “you”. Everything that is nobler in human nature (as described in Goethe's first poem, implies Jacobi), especially the ability to make decisions and transcend brute nature, is thus denied, and there is no alternative for human individuals, if they care to preserve at least a minimum of dignity, except to enjoy their declared sense of freedom only misleading (according to Goethe's second poem, as Jacobi also seems to imply). The humanism of the Enlightenment so praised, based on the ideal of pure rationality, was only a farce. In fact, it led to ""nihilism"" (a term, by the way, that Jacobi made popular).
According to Jacobi's report on his conversation with Lessing, after a disquisition of his part on the devastating effects of a thought based solely on the demands of reason, and on Lessing's apparent statement of sympathy for Spinoza, Jacobi had urged the latter to make a mortal leap (Jacobi, 1785: 17), that is, a kind of leap, heels on his head, which would correct his position. Enlightened philosopher he was, Lessing had been walking on his head. The leap — which Lessing humorously refused to execute citing old age as an excuse (Jacobi: 1785, 33–34) — would have brought him to his feet, back on the solid ground of common sense. Jacobi's obvious agenda, in other words, both at the time of this encounter with Lessing and later, in the exchange of views with Mendelssohn, was to attack the rationalism of the Enlightenment. However, it also implied a criticism of Goethe. The latter had led the Sturm und Drang reaction against the same rationalism that Jacobi was now condemning. Jacobi's veiled message was that the followers of this new cultural phenomenon had not been able to escape the rationalism of philosophers, since the new rebel humanism they advocated made sense only in the presumption that the conception of the reality of philosophers was the correct one. It is the desire to convey this message that alone explains the disconcerting presence in Jacobi's volume of Goethe's two poems. For Jacobi's contemporaries, who lacked the background knowledge of Jacobi's special relationship with Goethe, and even did not know Goethe's authorship of the second poem, his inclusion in the volume remained a mystery until the end.",C2
"Valdevaqueros is one of the last unspoilt beaches left in southern Spain, where the sky above the golden sands is full of kites carrying surfers on the waves. Currently, the beach has little more than a road bordered by motorhomes from Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain, full of windsurfers and kitesurfers attracted by the strong winds of the area.
For decades it has been a world apart from the concrete-covered beaches of Torremolinos and Marbella along the coast, but on 29 May the municipality of Tarifa approved plans to build a tourist complex right next to the beach, with 1,400 hotel rooms and 350 floors. Environmental and conservation groups have protested that the project will damage protected species habitats, but for most councillors here the issue is simple: jobs. In this population of 18,000, 2,600 are unemployed as Spain faces its worst economic crisis in at least half a century, one that has cast doubt on the future of the euro.
“Traditional sources of income such as fishing are disappearing, now that fleets are being dismantled and fish stocks are exhausted, so tourism is the only way out, as long as it is sustainable,” said Sebastián Galindo, a councillor of the Socialist Party, who is in opposition in Tarifa but voted with the ruling People’s Party to give the green light to the project.
The mayor of Tarifa, Juan Andrés Gil, refused to comment on the project, but Galindo said it meets environmental standards.
The complex would be 800 meters from the coast, comfortably beyond the minimum of 200 meters stipulated by a law aimed at avoiding more ugly developments such as those that affected much of the Spanish coast when mass tourism first descended to its coasts in the 1960s and 1970s.
Opponents of the complex say that the last thing anyone needs is more housing in a country that already has a million empty homes, although the central government proposed a sale last week by granting non-Spaniards residence permits in exchange for buying a property worth at least €160,000.
The socialist opposition in Madrid attacked the proposal, and Galindo said it discriminated against migrant workers who went to Spain during the boom years, many of them from Morocco, whose coast is only 14 km away and can be seen from Tarifa. “It’s in favor of classes with money instead of those who came here to help Spain get ahead,” he said. Surfers fear that new buildings in Valdevaqueros will reduce the strength of the famous local Levante wind, but do not attract traditional tourists. “It’s not really a familiar place. Just wait for them to see what an Levant looks like,” said Henning Mayer, who has regularly made the journey from Augsburg to Germany for 20 years. “Ten years ago they said they would build a new road here. It didn’t happen, so I think it will be impossible to build new hotels.”
At the southern end of Spain, Tarifa is the strategic crossroads between Africa and Europe, where the Mediterranean Sea meets the Atlantic. Activists say it also has a vital role in the animal world as a crossroads for migratory species.
The campaign to save the beach was launched hours after Tarifa's council voted for the project. The campaign has a Facebook page and is supported by groups such as Greenpeace, the World Wildlife Fund and the Spanish branch of the Birdlife conservation network. “It’s the environmental equivalent of putting a shopping center right in the middle of the Alhambra,” said Noelia Jurado, who uses her multimedia experience to campaign against the complex. He also noted that the complex would be close to the ancient Roman city of Baelo Claudia. “They could be building on more Roman ruins here. Nobody knows.
It also joins the opposition to the planned complex of the Andalusian College of Geographers, which, in a preliminary study plotted on its website, concluded that “free areas, ” including parking lots if not real buildings, will overlap part of the Alcornocales National Park. Geographers also estimate that the site interferes with two wildlife conservation areas. One of the areas of Valdevaqueros is home to two species of bats whose survival is threatened.
“Once again, money is being put before urban laws and European environmental directives,” said Raúl Romeva, a member of the European Parliament who is Vice-President of the Green Group. In Romeva's opinion, the project is also to blame because the proposed site has very little water in a city that already suffers from scarcity in the summer climate that burns the southern region of Andalusia. The lack of water recently led the Supreme Court of Andalusia to defend an appeal against plans to build a complex elsewhere in the region, which would have included golf courses, hotels and luxury homes.
Many locals also wonder why a complex should be built 10 km away, instead of on the vacant grounds near the picturesque old town of Tarifa, with its typically Andalusian white walls and winding streets, dominated by a Moorish castle of the 10th century. “My opinion and that of catering is that we agree with the complex as long as it creates jobs in the city, which is what is needed, but we are against it being for the benefit of a few,” said Cristóbal Lobato, who has worked at the same beachside bar in Tarifa for 30 years. “If you put it in the center of Tarifa, where there is space, guests can visit shops, tapas bars and restaurants.”
With a view to the green fields for construction, biologist Aitor Galán, who conducts environmental impact studies to earn a living, pointed out one of the only two coastal vulture farms in Europe. “Anywhere else in Europe, this place would have maximum protection, but here they want to get rid of everything and cover it with buildings,” he said. “What they want to do is turn this into Benidorm, but what attracts people here is wildlife and wind. But taking advantage of the current crisis and unemployment, builders and mayors who agree with them can justify any amount of destruction.”

"Some of the daily heroes in the United States are the country's paramedics. These young men and women are often the first people to respond to public medical emergencies. Paramedics should complete a very extensive physical training program that is designed to eliminate those who cannot make the cut. A paramedic must be in good condition and mentally strong to perform his duties in the face of danger. Many of these heroes must endure life-threatening situations when responding to emergencies. Paramedics are often linked to a county, or city fire department, but there are also some private paramedic organizations.

In Southern California, there are two primary schools for paramedic training. They are the Daniel Freeman paramedic program of UCLA and the Institute of Paramedical Training. Both schools provide candidates for the Los Angeles County and City Fire Departments. To become a paramedic for a county or city organization, candidates must also pass a psychological exam and a physical training program.
Some of the teams that paramedics carry are highly specialized. They carry basic and advanced life support equipment, such as forced entry tools so that they can reach people in danger, saws to cut obstacles and other emergency equipment. Paramedics provide valuable service to the communities they serve. They should be certified in Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) techniques and trained to handle all situations.
Some paramedics are trained to respond to what is called Mass Casuality Incidents (CMI). These emergencies occur whenever there is a tragic event such as the 11 September 2001 attacks on the country, and other emergencies such as earthquakes, landslides or floods. Paramedics can also be sent to emergency situations by citizens who call the 911 emergency phone number.",C2

Introduction
The sweet potato (Ipomoea sweet potatoes Lam) is one of the most
major food crops around the world. In Africa, cultivation is
used for food and income, although their marketing is limited
for its short service life (Rees et al., 2001; Oladoye et al.,
2016; Flores, 2018). In Tanzania, sweet potato is a
important food security root of cultivation after yuca ser
cultivated by 1.08 million small farmers (NBS, 2017).
With its annual production of 4.2 million tonnes per year,
Tanzania is Africa's leading producer, and accounts
for 3.8 per cent of world production of sweet potatoes (FAO,
2020).
The crop has consistent reliable yields, due to the
reason that it can be cultivated on marginal lands, and therefore
suitable for areas with long drought seasons. The crop is
useful recovery crop in case of disaster when other crops fail.
Sweet potatoes are also an important source of food in the
households of the rural and urban poor and important incomes
source for Tanzanian homes. Sweet potato lies
in its adaptability to marginal conditions such as
drought, low soil fertility, and therefore make it highly classified
as a food security crop when basic local crops such as
corn and rice failure (HKI, 2012; Waziri, 2013).
Tanzania ranks fifth in the world in terms of sweet potato
Production (HKI, 2012). Production data from Tanzania for
the sweet potato shows that there have been increasing trends
in the production and production area of sweet potatoes
in the country from 2008 to 2018 (NBS, 2020).
However, there is no disaggregated data to allow
indicate the level of orange sweet potatoes
(OFSP) and sweet white meat potatoes (WFSP)
production. OFSP is rich in beta-carotene, a vitamin A
to improve the nutrition of people in particular
children under 5 years of age. They have a high content
of carotenoids and pleasant sensory characteristics with
color (Neela and Fanta, 2019).",C2
"It has charted the highest peaks in the world, the ocean floor, the Amazon rainforest and has even taken a look at North Korea. But Google's mission to map the world has remained largely far from the inhospitable Arctic.
Now, however, the search engine signature is embarking on what could be the most significant update of centuries of polar cartography – and one that expects it to help provide a better understanding of life in permafrost for millions of web users. Google has taken a small team to Iqaluit, the largest city in the Canadian territory of Nunavut, armed with its warmer winter equipment, a stack of laptops and a telescopic camera mounted in a backpack of 18 kg.
With the help of an inuit mapping expert, and harassed by curious locals, the team spent four days touring the terrain and collecting images and information that will give the isolated community of the tundra of the island of Baffin what urbanists around the world now take for granted.
The city of 7,000 people will be displayed through Google’s popular Street View app in July 2013.
Aaron Brindle, project leader, said: “I live in Toronto and assume that everything is where it should be and that this map is a kind of my world, but for so long it has not been the case in the north.”
Unlike the most populous and accessible parts of the world, which have been mapped with a special camera mounted on a car roof, the Iqaluit project had mappers hiking the city's snow-filled roads and walking little-known trails, some of which are made of ice and disappear in the brief summer months.
The team also cut a road along a part of a 15-km dead end known as the Path to Nowhere, despite warnings about the risk of polar bears and other wild species.
Mayor John Graham said digital cartographers were, however, hunted down by a pack of excited and curious locals, or Google stalkers.
Graham understands enthusiasm. The Street View project, he said, follows in the footsteps of English explorer Martin Frobisher, who in 1576 sailed to the bay where Iqaluit now sits as he seeks the northwest passage, and the 1941 flight of Captain Elliott Roosevelt, a reconnaissance officer and son of the President of the United States, which led to the site being chosen for a military air base. Its exploration led to the foundation of the modern city of Iqaluit, which is the seat of the government, as well as a transportation and communications center for Nunavut.
One of the initial challenges Google faced was the collection of the raw data needed to fill in its existing map. What they had created using satellite images was quite accurate, although the rapid rate of growth of the city, which has been fueled by a mining boom, meant that they lacked a road that had been created in the last year, said Arif Sayani, city planning director.
Another difficulty was how to place many companies and homeowners who have mail sent to the local post office rather than hand it over to their address. The layout of the addresses of the post office box would result in a map with companies, banks and schools grouped around the Canada Post building in the city centre.
About 30 Inuit elders, entrepreneurs and high school students attended one night to help correct these problems. They were provided with a laptop and instructed how to ensure that their homes, shops and meeting places appeared accurately on the map.
The project is more than a cultural novelty or philanthropy. Sayani, 32, said the city could use maps as a promotional tool for those who think about visiting or moving to the area. It can also speed up planning decisions that will affect Iqaluit's growth.
The test for the Iqaluit mapping exercise took place last summer in Cambridge Bay, a much smaller city of Nunavut of about 1,500 people located 1,700 km and a time zone west of Iqaluit.
The gravel roads and muddy puddles that can now be seen online, however, give little meaning to life on a land generally covered with snow, which is one reason why Google selected the least hospitable month of March to travel to Iqaluit.
Brindle said he hoped to see the work continue in other northern cities, although high shipping costs and air tickets to move people and equipment around the vast Arctic territory seem to be weighing on Google's ambitions.
The next site in the north has not yet been identified, but, when selected, Brindle said the company could simply send one of his high-tech backpacks and rely on volunteers to literally get on the map.
“I hope that in three, four, five years we will look back and see a very different map of northern Canada,” Brindle added.

"A long time ago, film audiences were transported to a galaxy far, far away: one where imperial cruisers fought rebel fighters, where droids rubbed circuits with wookies, and where a spaceship called the Millennium Falcon could make Kessel's career in less than 12 parsecs. That was 1977, but, in 2015, when the franchise approaches its seventh series of big screens, interest in Star Wars shows no signs of diminishing – now there is news of a new film about Han Solo and a reappearance for Darth Vader. “Uncountable fans around the world are in a constant state of vigilance waiting for the release of new poster art, new trailers and other information,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at the Rentrak box office monitor. “It’s hard to imagine any other film franchise that can evoke a level of passion, enthusiasm and excitement.”
The latest Star Wars mania dates back to the purchase of the Hollywood Disney studio by Lucasfilm from the creator of the film, George Lucas, in 2012; the acquisition of $4 billion was accompanied by an announcement of three more sequential “episodes” – VII, VIII and IX – in addition to unspecified plans for spin-off and stand-alons films to fill the gaps in the release schedule. The details of the second spin-off have now been made public: a “history of origins” about Han Solo, the intergalactic smuggler played by Harrison Ford in the first three films, which is scheduled to be released in May 2018.
It will continue the release in December 2015 of Episode VII, directed by JJ Abrams and titled Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the unnamed Episode VIII scheduled for 2017 and the already announced spin-off, Rogue One, which will reach theaters in 2016.
That film will outline a rebel mission to steal the plans of the Death Star, a key element of the plot of the first film in 1977. Levels of interest in the rumor that Rogue One will also feature the reappearance of Darth Vader, the black villain of the original series, only confirmed the power of Star Wars' nostalgia.
By creating a multifaceted and multifaceted “universe” of film around Star Wars, Lucasfilm-Disney is taking his example from the phenomenally successful series produced by Marvel Studios, which Disney also acquired in 2009.
Disney has brought a new level of marketing knowledge to an already popular product: Dergarabedian cites the decision to make the six existing Star Wars movies available in streaming services as “a brilliant way to build anticipation for the new movie and revitalize the idea of Star Wars in the minds of fans.”
It is questionable whether it needs to be revitalized. The level of enthusiasm that has surrounded Star Wars for at least the last two decades is evident in what has become known as the “Expanded Universe”: the plethora of novels, comics, video games and merchandising that Lucasfilm has created or licensed over the years.
This additional material began to emerge since 1978, but was given a massive kick by the proliferation of the Internet in the 1990s. Role play and fan participation show no signs of deceleration: in the UK, the film brand Secret Cinema has found considerable commercial success with its live staging of The Empire Strikes Back.
Michael Rosser, news editor at Screen International, suggests that it is this “shared universe” of highly infectious nostalgia that keeps Star Wars in the pole position among film franchises. “The good thing about the original films was that they created a huge universe of characters and possibilities that caused the imagination of viewers,” he said.
“For years, people have been wondering how the different threads would develop. This new film, because it’s going back to Han Solo and Luke Skywalker, looks like it’s reconnecting with the original Star Wars in a way the prequels failed.”
Rosser refers to the three films directed by Lucas between 1999 and 2005 – The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith – which narrated the life of Luke Skywalker's father, Anakin, who transforms into Darth Vader. Despite having been received with less than stellar reviews, the prequels took $2.5 billion into the world box office, shortly after the launch of the restored and augmented “special editions” of the first trilogy had net $469 million in 1997.
“It shows the power of Star Wars that, although disappointing, the prequels still made a lot of money,” Rosser said.
In a film business where branding is everything and a successful franchise the answer to everyone's prayers, is there a risk that film studios will simply become branding machines and lose their interest in film for their own good?
Rosser doesn't think so. “They are desperate to ensure the longevity of the franchise and ensure that quality is maintained. They are also trying to take people to the movies at a time when many are staying home for entertainment. But you don’t want to see Star Wars on your iPhone, so I don’t think you’ll run out of steam anytime soon.”
Meanwhile, Dergarabedian is anticipating a massive business when The Force Awakens arrives at the cinemas in December 2015. “We are certainly facing a record opening for December and should continue to earn at least a billion dollars worldwide. Truly, Star Wars is the latest film brand.”

"Needless to say, human beings (identifiable mammals such as those standing and being comparatively advanced and capable of detailed thought) have rather remarkable bodies, given all they have accomplished. (In addition, an especially intelligent human brain produced this text!) Human beings have undoubtedly overcome predators, diseases and all kinds of obstacles for thousands of years.
To fully understand and appreciate these achievements, let's take in some of the best known parts of the human body!
The head, or the spherical part of the body that contains the brain and rests on the top of the human body, has enough individual organs and parts of the body in it. (It should be mentioned quickly that the hair occupies the space at the top of the head, and the ears, the organs responsible for hearing, are on both sides of the head.) From top to bottom, eyebrows, or horizontal strips of hair that can be found above the eye, are the first components of the head. The eyes are under them, and they are round, orb-like organs that allow humans to see.
The eyes give way to the nose, or to an external organ that plays an important role in the respiratory and bacterial removal processes. Below is the mouth, or a large, cavernous organ that chews food, eliminates bacteria, helps with breathing, and more. The mouth contains teeth, or small, white, pointed parts of the body that are used to chew food, and the tongue, or a red, boneless organ used to chew food and talk.
The neck is the part of the long body that connects the head to the chest (the part of the muscle body that protects the heart and lungs), and the stomach, or the part of the body that contains food and fluid processing organs, is below that.
Legs are the long, muscular parts of the body that allow humans to move from one point to another and perform a variety of actions. Each leg contains one thigh (a thick, especially muscular part of the body used to perform strenuous movements; the upper part of the leg) and a calf (thinner, more flexible part of the body that absorbs shock associated with movement; the lower part of the leg). The feet can be found at the bottom of the legs, and each foot consists of five toes, or small appendages that help balance.
The arms are long and powerful body parts that are on both sides of the chest, under the shoulders; the arms are composed of biceps (the thickest and most powerful upper portion), and forearms (the thinner and more flexible lower portion). The hands, or small, body parts that grab used for a large number of actions, are at the end of the arms. Each hand contains five fingers, or small appendages used to grab objects.
The shoulders mentioned above are rounded body parts that help the flexibility of the arms. One's back is on the opposite side of the stomach, and it is a flat section of the body that contains important muscles that are intended to protect the lungs and other internal organs, in addition to helping humans perform certain movements and actions.",C2
"At Addis Ababa airport, visitors are greeted by images of golden grains, ochre red seeds and a group of men gathered around a giant pancake. The Billboards boast: “Teff: the ultimate gluten-free crop!”
Ethiopia is one of the poorest countries in the world, well known for its precarious food security situation. But it is also the native home of teff, an ancient, highly nutritious grain that is increasingly found on its way in health food stores and supermarkets in Europe and America.
The small seeds of Teff, the size of the poppy seeds, are high in calcium, iron and protein, and have an impressive set of amino acids. Naturally gluten-free, grain can replace wheat flour in anything, from bread and pasta to waffles and pizza bases. Like quinoa, the Andean grain, the magnificent nutritional profile of teff offers the promise of new and lucrative markets in the west.
In Ethiopia, Teff is a national obsession. Cultivated by some 6.3 million farmers, agricultural fields cover more than 20 per cent of all cultivated land. Ground in flour and used to make injera, the fermented flat bread that is basic for Ethiopian cuisine, the grain is central to many religious and cultural ceremonies. Across the country, and in neighbouring Eritrea, diners gather around large pieces of injera, which double as cutlery, gathering stews and feeding each other as a sign of loyalty or friendship, a tradition known as gurusha.
Outside diaspora communities in the west, Teff has flown under the radar for decades. But the growing appetite for traditional crops and the boom in healthy, gluten-free food markets are instilling new life to the point, increasingly promoted as Ethiopia’s “second gift to the world,” after coffee.
Sophie Kebede, a London-based entrepreneur who owns a British grain company, says she was “glazed” when she discovered her nutritional value. “I didn’t know I was so wanted. I am of Ethiopian origin; I’ve been eating injera all my life.”
The growing demand for so-called ancient grains has not always been a direct victory for poor communities. In Bolivia and Peru, reports of rising incomes due to current global trade in quinoa have been added to those of malnutrition and land conflicts, as farmers sell their entire crop to meet Western demand.
Ethiopia's growing middle class is also increasing demand for teff and rising domestic prices have put grain out of reach of the poorest. Today, most small farmers sell most of what they grow to the city’s consumers.
This may have helped raise incomes in some rural areas, but it has had nutritional consequences, says the government, as teff is the most nutritionally valuable grain in the country. Estimates suggest that while urban dwellers consume up to 61 kg of teff per year, in rural areas the figure is 20 kg. The type of consumption also differs: the rich eat almost exclusively the most expensive varieties of magna and white teff; the less well-off consumers tend to eat less valuable red and mixed teff, and more than half combine it with cheaper cereals such as sorghum and maize.
The Ethiopian government wants to double the production of teff by 2015. Its strategy, published in 2013, argues that grain could play an important role in school meals and emergency relief programmes, and help reduce malnutrition, especially among children and adolescents.
Although Ethiopia has a fast-growing economy, it remains on the UN list of least developed countries. It is estimated that 20 per cent of children under 5 years of age are undernourished or stunted.
The government's Agricultural Transformation Agency aims to boost yields by developing improved grain varieties, along with new planting techniques and tools to reduce post-harvest losses.
Government restrictions, introduced in 2006, prohibit the export of raw teff grain, allowing only shipments of injera and other processed products. But this could change: the goal is to produce enough teff for domestic consumption and a strong export market, according to the government's strategy.
Mama Fresh is a family business that has been selling injera to the best restaurants and hotels in the Ethiopian capital for years. It also sends flat bread to Finland, Germany, Sweden and the United States, mainly for consumption by diaspora communities. But, the company has its eye on the gluten-free market. It aims to double exports to America in 2014 and will soon start producing pizzas, bread and cookies based on teff.
“Typically, these products will pass through many hands before reaching the Sainsbury shelves or wherever. There are profit margins at every step and small farmers are not necessarily well placed to negotiate with big traders,” says David Hallam, Director of Trade and Markets of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. He considers the popularity of quinoa to be a warning story about how export opportunities can be a mixed blessing for poor countries.
Regassa Feyissa, an Ethiopian agricultural scientist and former head of the National Biodiversity Institute, warns that, without careful planning, increased production of teff for export can displace other crops important to farmers. And efforts to boost production could benefit business interests at the expense of small farmers.
With little Ethiopian teff on the international market, farmers in the US They've started planting the harvest. Farmers in Europe, Israel and Australia have also experimented with it.
Kebede says he gets his grain from farms in southern Europe, although he would rather get it from Ethiopia. “Teff is the second nature of an Ethiopian, so who better to supply it? We have this coveted grain grown in the country, so why can’t an Ethiopian farmer benefit from this?”

"Singapore's economy declined by 4.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008, the Ministry of Trade and Industry said Thursday, as it predicts that the economy would contract between 2 and 5 percent this year.
The boats sail under a bridge near the financial district of Singapore.
Compared to strong growth of 7.8 percent a year earlier, the economy grew by 1.1 percent throughout 2008, the ministry added.
He called the gross domestic product growth prospects for 2009 weak... due to the pessimistic global economic outlook.
All major sectors, except construction, business services, and information and communications, saw contractions, the ministry said.
The Ministry cited a decline in private sector investment and private consumption spending to reduce total domestic demand.
The decline in global demand for electronic products, pharmaceuticals and chemicals was also likely to have an impact on the manufacturing sector.

"Like the veins that carry the blood of a city, a subway system is full of billions of inhabitants: the bacteria of Swiss cheese and kimchi, bubonic plague and drug-proof insects and human skin. Now, for the first time, scientists have started cataloging and mapping bacteria circulating in a city's subway, and have found a lot of curious results.
Dr. Christopher Mason, a geneticist at Weill Cornell Medical College, led a team that, for 18 months, made a sample of New York City's subway system for microscopic life forms that cover their tourniquets, seats, lockers, and stations. In what Mason called “the first scale genetic profile of the city,” his team found meningitis in Times Square, a trail of anthrax in the hand of a train car and bacteria that cause bubonic plague in a garbage can and a ticket machine at the stations in central Manhattan.
In an investigation published in Cell Systems magazine, the team sharply lowered the findings of plague and anthrax, pointing to the extremely small trail of the latter, that rats probably carried the first and that no one has fallen sick of plague in or around New York for years.
“The results do not suggest that the plague or anthrax is frequent,” the study says. “They don’t even suggest that New York residents are at risk.”
In fact, most bacteria identified by the team are harmless to humans or beneficial in the city's thriving world of microorganisms, many of which process toxic hazards and residues in the same way that bacteria within each human being help with digestion and bodily functions.
Some of the results were expected, Mason said, including some bacteria associated with fecal matter, which he said “should be a gentle reminder for people to wash their hands.” He also said that many bacteria of the same genus that “are beneficial and useful, such as the one used to make cheese,” also appeared in New York.
Bacteria seemed to reflect eating habits in several neighborhoods. Around the metro, bacteria associated with cheeses – brie, cheddar, parmesan and mozzarella appeared from the ubiquitous New York pizza. The distinctive Swiss cheese bacteria were more localized in downtown Manhattan and the financial district, and the bacteria used to ferment cabbage for kimchi and sauerkraut appeared in the financial district and Bay Ridge. The computer also identified cucumber DNA throughout the city, Mason said.
Bacteria associated with diseases and infections were extremely common. Species that cause diarrhea and nausea, both benign and bad E.coli (mostly benign), and bacteria that can cause skin infections and urinary infections were common throughout the city. The species that produces tetanus appeared in Soho and the bacteria that cause dysentery appeared at one station in the Bronx and another in Harlem.
With over 1,000 samples collected from all 466 open subway stations in New York City, Mason and his team passed the organic materials through a DNA sequencer and then through a supercomputer armed with genetic databases. They identified 15,152 different species, almost half of which were bacteria.
The good news, the researchers wrote, is that these “potentially infectious agents” are not spreading diseases or diseases all over New York, but seem to be “normal cohabitants” and “can even be essential.” They represent a normal and 'healthy' metagenome profile of a city.
In short, researchers conclude, the subway and the city are as safe as everyone thought.
Mason said people shouldn't worry about getting urinary tract infections from the subway seats. “You should wash your hands,” he said, “and probably get some sleep and eat salads and go to the gym, and that’s almost the same today as yesterday.”
“In any case,” he added, “I’ve become much safer on the subway.”
Many findings made sense: traffic stations like Grand Central and Times Square had more bacteria and more diversity among them; the subway was more enriched for skin-associated bacteria. The Bronx, with its various neighborhoods and seasons, had the greatest diversity of bacteria; Staten Island, with only three stops, had the lowest.
Researchers found marine bacteria in South Ferry, a season that flooded during Hurricane Sandy, but were surprised to note that species included some normally associated with Antarctica and fish.
The next steps, Mason said, are studies of other cities, which have begun in Paris, São Paolo and Shanghai, and continued studies of New York, for example, to see how the microbiome changes with the seasons. He said he hoped the research would provide a “base” of research for health officials and geneticists, and could help health officials to be better prepared to prevent and track diseases and pathogens.

"The Nietzschean method of genealogy, in its application to modern subjectivity, is another facet of philosophical postmodernism. The application of Michel Foucault's genealogy to the formative moments of the history of modernity and his exhortations to experiment with subjectivity place him in the realm of postmodern discourse. In the 1971 essay ""Nietzsche, Genealogy, History"", Foucault explains his adaptation of the genealogical method in his historical studies. First of all, he says, genealogy “is opposed to the search for ‘origins’” (Foucault 1977, 141). In other words, genealogy studies accidents and contingencies that converge at crucial moments, giving rise to new epochs, concepts and institutions. As Foucault points out: “What is found in the historical principle of things is not the inviolable identity of their origin; it is the dissension of other things. It is disparity” (Foucault 1977, 142). In Nietzschean fashion, Foucault exposes history conceived as the origin and development of an identical subject, for example, “modernity”, as a fiction, modern discourses invent after the fact. Behind the fiction of modernity is a sense of temporality that excludes the elements of chance and contingency at stake at every moment. In short, linear and progressive history covers the discontinuities and interruptions that mark the points of succession in historical time.
Foucault deploys genealogy to create what he calls a “counter-memory” or “a transformation of history into a totally different form of time” (Foucault 1977, 160). This implies dissolving the identity of the subject in history by using the materials and techniques of modern historical research. Just as Nietzsche postulates that religious will to truth in Christianity results in the destruction of Christianity by science (see Nietzsche 1974 [1882], 280–83), Foucault postulates that genealogical research will result in the disintegration of the epistemic subject, since the subject's continuity is broken by the gaps and accidents that historical research discovers. The first example of this research is the Histoire de la folie à l'age classique, published in 1961, the full version of which was published in English as History of Madness in 2006. Here, Foucault gives an account of the historical beginnings of modern reason as it comes to be defined against madness in the seventeenth century. His thesis is that the practice of confining madmen is a transformation of the medieval practice of confining lepers in lazar houses. These institutions managed to survive long after the lepers disappeared, and so there was already an institutional structure of confinement when the modern concept of insanity as a disease was conformed. However, while institutions of detention have been maintained in the past, the practice of confining mad persons constitutes a break with the past.
Foucault focuses on the moment of transition, as modern reason begins to take shape in a confluence of concepts, institutions and practices, or, as he would say, of knowledge and power. In his nascence, reason is a power that defines itself against another, one whose truth and identity is also assigned by reason, thus giving reason the sense of originating from itself. For Foucault, the question is that madness is not allowed to speak for itself and is at the disposal of a power that dictates the terms of its relationship. As he points out: “What is original is the cassura that establishes the distance between reason and non-reason; the subjugation of the reason of non-reason, taking away from it its truth as madness, crime or disease, derives explicitly from this point” (Foucault 1965, x). The truth of reason is found when madness becomes in the place of non-reason, when the difference between them is inscribed in their opposition, but it is not identical to their dominant side. In other words, the reason that opposes madness is not identical to the reason that attributes its difference. The latter would be the reason without an opposite power, a free floating power without definite form. As Foucault suggests, this floating mystery could be represented in the nave of foolish motive, which, in medieval times, represented madness. Such is the paradoxical structure of historical transformation.
In his later writings, especially in The Use of Pleasure (Foucault 1985 [1984]), Foucault uses historical research to open up possibilities of experimenting with subjectivity, showing that subjectivity is a formative power of the self, overcoming the structures of knowledge and the power from which it emerges. This is a power of thought, which Foucault says is the ability of human beings to problematize the conditions in which they live. For philosophy, this means “the effort to know how and to what extent it might be possible to think differently, rather than legitimizing what is already known” (Foucault 1985 [1984], 9). Thus he joins Lyotard in promoting creative experimentation as a leading power of thought, a power that surpasses reason, narrowly defined, and without which thought would be inert. In this sense, Foucault joins others who profess a postmodern sensitivity to contemporary science, art and society. It should also be noted that Foucault's writings are a hybrid of philosophy and historical research, just as Lyotard combines the language games of the expert and philosopher in The Postmodern Condition. This blend of philosophy with concepts and methods from other disciplines is characteristic of postmodernism in its broadest sense.",C2
"Up to one billion people will remain in extreme poverty by 2030 unless countries focus on inequalities and confront social, economic and cultural forces that block their escape or drag them back to impoverishment, a major report warns. The report of the Chronic Poverty Advisory Network (CPN) states that many people can rise above the poverty line of $1.25 a day, only to retreat when they are affected by a combination or sequence of shocks such as drought, disease and insecurity or conflict.
Based on household group surveys, the report found that, in some rural areas of Kenya and South Africa, between 30 and 40 per cent of those who escaped poverty receded and increased to 60 per cent in some areas of Ethiopia between 1999 and 2009. Even in successful countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam, the proportion has been 20%. Individual cases highlight the ease with which people can return to poverty.
Amin, 61, from rural Bangladesh, has seen her livelihood gradually decline, due to her own illnesses and those of her wife, the cost of her child's marriage, the death of her father and the loss of assets such as fishing nets. Lovemore, 74, from Zimbabwe, has become one of the poorest people in her village. He recently lost his job as a parking assistant due to poor health and had to receive his five grandchildren after the death of his daughters.
“We need to ensure that people emerging from poverty remain permanently above the poverty line. Too many families are experiencing 'two steps forward, one step backwards', where they struggle to recover from personal or major setbacks. Governments should not assume that, just because someone’s income reaches $1.25, that means work done,” said Andrew Shepherd, a researcher at the Overseas Development Institute, partner of the CPAN, and lead author of the report.
A high-level UN panel considering a new development framework to succeed the Millennium Development Goals beyond 2015 said the goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030 was within reach. However, the report argues that “more of the same” will not reach zero.
Despite the decline in extreme poverty from 1.9 billion in 1990 to 1.2 billion in 2010, the report says that progress over the next 15 years will be much more difficult. China ' s great achievements are unlikely to be accompanied by similar progress elsewhere, while climate-related shocks and deep poverty in some parts of sub-Saharan Africa will slow the momentum. The report calls for a change in thinking about poverty to focus on the chronic poor – those who are poor for many years or their entire lives – and a greater emphasis on stopping impoverishment, falling to poverty. “Governments have been good enough to move people above the poverty line because that’s relatively easy – there’s a tendency to reap the low fruits, but they’ve moved away from the hardest task of tackling chronic poverty,” said Shepherd.
The report says that progress in poverty reduction, although impressive to date, has had less impact on the chronic poor than on those who were already closer to the poverty line. It will not be possible to reach zero unless development policies give priority to those living in chronic poverty, he adds. Policy makers must aspire to a “zero tripod” of separate but interdependent goals: to address chronic poverty; to stop impoverishment; to sustain the escape from poverty. They presented a trio of policies, all of which require massive global investment.
The first is social assistance – a safety net – to bring the poorest people closer to a decent standard of living. One example is Ethiopia ' s productive safety net programme, which enabled thousands of vulnerable households to withstand drought without having to reduce spending on education. The second is education, from early childhood to the beginning of work, so that people can escape and stay out of poverty. Education also has the advantage of being a “portable” asset. The third is economic growth policies that favour the poorest to ensure that the benefits of increasing national prosperity reach the poorest people.
“Economic growth is really critical, but not any old growth,” said Shepherd. “It has to generate not only employment, but decent jobs, not just insecure and low-paid jobs. There are ways to do this, such as India’s rural employment guarantee scheme, which has boosted urban wages not just rural.” Another example cited in the report was the extension of South Africa ' s minimum wage to groups such as domestic workers.
All this will require money and the report says that an obvious implication is that stronger national tax systems and higher tax revenues will be needed. Support will also be needed to cover the initial costs of social assistance, universal health coverage and education funding, including scholarships for the poorest children. “Help continues to play a huge role in the next 20 years, as many developing countries spend less than $500 on each of their citizens each year. Even Nigeria, with its oil wealth, spends only $650 per capita,” said Shepherd.
In a context of crisis in Syria, South Sudan and the Central African Republic, conflicts and environmental disasters must be addressed, and the report said that it was essential for Governments to work to reduce the risk of conflict and establish inclusive peace settlements.
Choose the best answer according to the text. 1. Who are the 'chronically poor'?
The incorporation of “reducing inequality (income)” as a post-2015 goal would lead the international agenda in the right direction, given that the reduction or containment of inequality accelerates the impact of economic growth on poverty reduction. The report argues that addressing inequalities affecting the poorest people – such as access to land, labour markets and power relations between men and women – would address two goals at the same time: reducing chronic poverty and inequality.
The authors urge Governments to develop an inclusive national development plan and to work with civil society to ensure that the poorest people are politically represented, as well as to address the difficult social norms such as dowry and witchcraft that contribute to extreme poverty: “This often means challenging and, perhaps, sweeping aspects of the status quo and represents the sharpest deviation from “business as usual”.",C2
"His Edinburgh and Cambridge mentors were to give decisive shape to Darwin's philosophical attitudes and his scientific career. It was Henslow who was the last link to Darwin in a chain connected to Captain Robert Fitzroy of H. M. S. Beagle. Fitzroy sought a fellow knight who could also collect information on geology and natural history during a proposal of circumnavigation of the world. Henslow’s note to Darwin, asking if he would be interested in being recommended for this position, came to Darwin’s house, ‘the Mount’, while Charles Darwin was in a geological study of North Wales with Adam Sedgwick. After his father's resistance had been overcome, Darwin offered the position and accepted it.
The combination of meticulous field observation, collection and experimentation, taking notes, reading and thinking during what became the five-year journey of the Beagle through a very wide cross section of the earth's environments was to establish the course for the rest of his life. During the trip he read and re-read the Principles of Geology of Charles Lyell, a three-volume work that articulated a philosophical view of rigorously empirical historical science, centered around five key ideas:
The geologist investigates both the animated and inanimate changes that have taken place during Earth's history.
Its main tasks are to develop a precise and complete record of these changes, encapsulate this knowledge in general laws, and search for their causes.
This search should be limited to the causes that can be studied empirically—those that “are now in operation,” as Lyell puts it in the subtitle of his Principles.
Records or ‘monuments’ of the Earth’s past indicate a constant process of ‘introduction’ and ‘extinction’ of species, and it is the task of the geologist to look for the causes of these introductions and extinctions, according to the note of strictions in 3. above.
The only serious attempt to do so according to the idea that species are capable of ‘indefinite modification’, that of Jean Baptiste Lamarck, is a failure for methodological reasons. All evidence supports the view that species variability is limited, and that one species cannot be transformed into another.
This vision deeply influenced Darwin, as he freely admitted. While he was convinced by his observations and his reading that the fossil record and the current distribution of species could only be due to the gradual transformation of one species into another, he was determined to articulate a theory that conformed to Lyell's principles. The crucial event to convince him that this was going to be the work of his life was probably a visit to Cape Town, South Africa, during the Beagle's return trip to England. John F. W. Herschel was in Cape Town on a mission to do for the southern hemisphere what his father William had done for the north, namely, to develop a complete star map with the new powerful telescopes developed by his father and aunt. As noted earlier, Darwin had been deeply impressed by Herschel's preliminary speech on the study of natural philosophy when he first appeared a year before the Beagle set sail, and in his private diary he referred to his meetings with Herschel during a one-week stop in Cape Town in June 1836 as one of the deepest events of the entire trip. Just five months before meeting Darwin, Herschel had finished reading the second edition of the Lyell Principles. He sent Lyell a long letter full of detailed constructive comments. The letter opens by praising Lyell for addressing the issue of the ‘introduction of new species’ — which Herschel calls ‘that mystery of mysteries’ — scientifically, and for advocating that we seek ‘intermediate causes’ to explain these ‘introductions’ — code for natural causes, rather than ‘miraculous’ causes. [5] This part of the letter was cited in Charles Babbage's Treaty of Bridgewater, published in 1837 as Darwin struggled to develop such a theory. Reading Herschel’s quotation in Babbage, Darwin wrote in his private ‘species’ notebooks:
Babbage 2d Edit, p. 226.—Herschel calls the appearance of new species. the mystery of mysteries. & has big step over problem.! Hurrah.— “intermediate causes”. (Barrett et al. 1987, 413; original score)
He clearly recognizes that Herschel is here providing a philosophical justification for the project that Darwin was working on in secret. And, in the first paragraph of On the Origin of Species, Darwin looks back at this Hurrah, attributing the idea that the origin of the species is ‘that mystery of mysteries’ to ‘one of our greatest philosophers’, not to mention Herschel by name. The first mention of the possibility of an evolutionary solution to this problem is in its Ornithological Notebooks, in a note written shortly after leaving Cape Town.",C2
"The so-called Meinong self-presentation (Selbstpräsentation) generally counts as a mark of consciousness, of the manifest mental. Experiences, that is, conscious mental occurrences, are able to present themselves. This type of self-presentation is not yet the presentation of self or ego, which was not a problem for Meing. It must also be separated from self-evidence in the sense of infallibility, and from internal perception, self-observation, and higher-order thinking. All manifest mental life is self-presentation, that is, all the experiences of a subject are self-presentation to the subject who experiences. If you're happy it's raining, you can capture your happiness in inner perception, but not through separate mental content. That your mental experiences are presented to you means that they refer to your instant experiences without the intermediary of an additional representation of them. You are able to reflect on your momentary anger or your feeling of shame without needing a kind of mental symbol of your anger or your feeling of shame.
Generally, the objects of experiences are not constituted by their experiences: they are something independent of the mind and not immanent to the consciousness. What is immanent to the mind (consciousness) are one's own experiences. When you have a red representation, for example, you are aware of the red object. In such a representation of red, the red content serves as a kind of sign of something, that is, red, and is in itself a mental piece of the whole representation. To present the red content as the object of an internal reflexive experience, no additional, separate representation is required, with an additional mental content to which the red content corresponds as an object. The red content has the ability to present itself to your mind. In general, reference to one's own experiences does not require the intervention of additional content. Meinong thinks that all internal experiences and all parts of them are capable of being apprehended through self-presentation. Meinong (1910, §20: 138 [103], §43: 264 [190-1]; 1915, §33; 1917, §1) calls it the self-presentation of internal experiences in opposition to the other-presentation [Fremdpräsentation], where the content functions as a sign of something else. Since experiences do not need to be carried within the range of apprehension by their own presentations (and contents), Meinong calls the self-presenting parts of an experience (act component and content component) and all quasi-content self-presenting experience. The quasi-content coincides with the object to be apprehended or intended. When you want something, it may also happen that you judge about your desire. All desire, then, is presented to you without any additional content that interferes. It plays the role of a content, so to speak, hence the name “quasi-content”.
Meinong (1906, 11 and 13; 1910, 43) thinks that attention allows us to do two different things with one and the same experience and content respectively: (1) If we turn our attention to our inner experience, for example, to the red content of a representation of red, this same content serves the inner perception of itself — the red content becomes an intended object and serves the apprehension (perception) of itself. It also says that in this case the content is turned inwards (introversion, [Einwärtswendung]). (2) If the content contributes to a perception or thought of something red, the content refers to something external to the mind — it serves for the apprehension of the co-ordinated outer objects and can therefore be called out (extraversion, [Auswärtswendung]).",C2
"Twitter is on the verge of its initial public offer and the panties around the world have been in a knot all week because of the lack of diversity of company management, i.e. women. Like the New York Times said last week, the board? All white men. Investors? All men. The executive officers? All men except the attorney general, Vijaya Gadde, who has had the job for five weeks.
Question: Why Is This a Problem?
First, there are not enough women on Twitter or in the world of technology because there are not enough women anywhere.
Some facts: Women make up 6% of the executive heads of the top 100 technology companies, and that has taken years to achieve. Most startups have male boards. In 2012, women held 16.6 per cent of the seats on the Fortune 500 Board of Directors. Colored women accounted for 3.3 per cent of the total. One tenth of the total had no women serving on their boards. Over the past five years, women and minorities have lost ground despite strong evidence that gender parity and diversity of boards have a positive impact on profitability.
Twitter had more than a year to prepare for this IPO: Where are the women? The company's immediate response focused on a shortage of candidates. The technology industry has a well-documented pipeline problem, one of the results of much of the gender stereotypes that reach the education system.
However, companies tend to attract executives from outside their own industries -- sometimes, yes, even women -- when seeking high-level positions and boards of directors. It allows them to pollinate crossed ideas, diversify their experience and innovate. For example, Apple has hired Angela Ahrendts, CEO of Burberry. During his tenure in Burberry, the company doubled its revenues and tripled its share price. Companies redefine the pipeline every day, especially when it comes to profits.
The technology sector is dressed as progressive when it actually shows all the indications of being, at its core, powerfully retrograde. Despite investing in diversity programmes, the management of technology companies is not clearly diverse, and indeed the industry continues to dazzle with incidents in which men joyfully show their biases even implicit. Last month's Titshare debacle -LRB-, click and cry -RRB-, as well as the long-awaited dismissal of Business Insider from CTO Pax Dickinson -LRB-, who for years has been squeezing such sexist, racist tweets as Jesus is violated by a package of n **** s. It's his own fault for dressing up like a whore although -RRB- are two recent examples.
Secondly, sexism is perfectly combined with the distribution of capital.
The September launch by Bryan Goldberg of Bustle, a women-centred website - LRB- news and global politics along with beauty tips -RRB- was a strong case in point. After announcing the site in a post deaf tone, Goldberg was largely mocked by his personal failure to understand, among other things, how ridiculous his claim to be starting the first of his kind for women was. The real problem is not Goldberg's lack of clues, but institutional biases that allowed him to raise $6.5 million when women are much more capable, knowledgeable and experienced can't.
Companies with at least one female founder account for only 13 per cent of those funded. Risk capitalists are less likely to invest in startups if women are involved in their management; investors actively reduce participation in companies that appoint directors. These are particular irony, as new start-ups run by women use 40% less capital to launch them. These facts do not reflect women who lack ideas of trust. They illustrate discrimination, whether conscious or not.
Thirdly, while we think of Twitter as a technology company, it is a media company and part of a broader environment that recently corrected its failure in diversity. Year after year, studies as one of last week's Americas Directors Association, as well as reports from Who Makes the News and the Women's Media Center Status on Women in Media document exactly how distorted media ownership, management and production remain. Only online is improving the situation. But even there the difference is to a large extent increases in the pink neck content oriented towards women.
How can we separate these facts from the property? We can't. As the Federal Communications Commission reported, our media is almost entirely owned and managed by white men.
Finally, what does this have to do with the speech? Everything. Male experiences, interests, expectations and voices, mainly white, inform the way we think, decide how our resources are dispersed and define our rules. The ghetto status of women and minorities in the media and technology, along with the lack of venture capital investments, means that our attempts to express ourselves are limited, distorted and regularly reworked so that what we say is acceptable to a sexist status quo.
And this status quo is not entirely interested in the idea of women as capable and autonomous leaders who could change the rules in an unsettling and risky way. Declaring these facts baldly is not an accusation of white men as individuals. It is a description of the systemic problems that we refuse to face with systemic solutions.
The presence of a carefully selected handful of women in technology, regardless of how determined, capable and prominently visible they are, has done little for decades to alter the composition of management and ownership. Gender diversity on Twitter, as elsewhere, is not a priority because people make reasonable decisions about what they think will be profitable and successful: Twitter is looking for experience and experience within a comfort zone.
This is not a gender issue for me, it is an innovation issue, explained Dick Costolo, CEO of Twitter. Gender issues are not innovation issues only if their gender is dominant and the norm. This reason, and others like her, are exactly the kind of marginalization of 1,000 paper cuts that result in fewer women pursuing technological careers to begin with.
Twitter is a part of a male-dominated social structure, economy, and culture, all of which depend on crib-to-bomb sexism to be profitable. That's tweetable by the way.

"Probatory research on the psyche was a major concern for Nietzsche throughout his career, and this aspect of his thinking has been correctly assigned to a central importance along a long stretch of reception, from Kaufmann (1950) to recent works by Pippin (2010), Katsafanas (2016), and others. Some of Nietzsche's own programmatic reflections highlight the centrality of this company: perhaps the most famous thing is that it closes an extended treatment of the deficiencies of the previous philosophy (in Part I of Beyond Good and Evil) with a demand
that psychology be recognized again as the queen of science, for whose service and preparation the other sciences exist. For psychology it is once again on the road to fundamental problems. (BGE 23)
In section 2, we saw that the critique of Nietzsche's morality is based primarily on psychological analysis that purports to expose the self-destructive effects of moral attitudes such as guilt and ascetic abnegation, as well as the corrosive mismatch between the official claims of altruistic morality and its underlying motivation in resentment. On the positive side, Nietzsche is equally willing to detail the psychological conditions he thinks would be healthier for both individuals and cultures (see, for example, GS Pref. and 382; BGE 212; IT V, 3 and VIII, 6-7). Thus, Nietzsche's psychology is central to his evaluative agenda and projects as a cultural critic. Apart from his instrumental support for these other projects, Nietzsche pursues psychological research for his own good, and apparently also for the self-knowledge that intrinsically implies (GM III, 9; GS Pref., 3 and 324; but cf. GM Pref., 1). However, despite the widespread appreciation of Nietzsche's psychological insight that began with Freud himself — and despite the centrality of psychology in his philosophical method, his central questions and his evaluative objectives — even the most basic schemes of his substantive psychology remain controversial. The debate begins with the object of psychology itself, the psyche, the self or the soul.
A significant body of Nietzschean texts express extreme skepticism that there is such a thing as a “me,” or “soul,” as well as doubts about the traditional faculties of the soul and the basic abilities they were supposed to exercise (think, want, feel). This passage from the notebooks is typical—“To consent to the fable of ‘unity’, ‘soul’, ‘person’, we have forbidden this: with such hypotheses one only covers the problem” (KSA 37[4] 11: 577)—and there are many, probably hundreds, like him (see D 109; GS 333; BGE 12, 17, 19, 54; GM I, 13; IT III, 5 and VI, 3). At the same time, Nietzsche’s own psychological analyses freely appeal not only to the self, but even to some of the traditional faculties, such as the will, of which he is more skeptical elsewhere: for example, GM II’s “sovereign individual” 1-3 is distinctive in developing a “memory of the will” that supports his ability to keep promises and “vote for himself as the future” (GM I, 13); or again, Nietzsche’s preferred strategy of deploying a multiplicity of perspectives in knowledge (see section 3.2.6) assumes the existence of a cognitive self that deviates from certain impulses and affects, and thus has “the ability to control and dispose of Pro and Con” in support of the broader cognitive project (GM III, 12, see also BGE 284).
This apparent conflict in the texts has fostered contradictory interpretations, with commentators emphasizing the threads in Nietzsche to those who have more philosophical sympathy. For example, strongly naturalistic performers such as Brian Leiter (2002, 2007) and Matthias Risse (2007) focus on Nietzsche's scepticism about pure will and soul to reject any Kantian-style agency source that can stand apart and direct the basic impulses of the person or fundamental nature. Similarly, readers attracted by a Cartesian conception of consciousness as the essence of mental dualism, but repelled by the Cartesian, highlight Nietzsche's emphasis on the importance of the body (GM III, 16; Z I, 4) to suggest that his apparent claims about psychology should be heard as a kind of physiology of impulses that reject mental psychology altogether (for different versions, see Poellner 1995: 216-29, 174; Haar [1993] 1996: 90, et passim). Attacking unity rather than mentality, a group of readers interested in Nietzsche's agonistic conception of politics tends to emphasize his similarly agonistic conception of self, internally contested (Hatab 1995; Acampora 2013). In a diametrically opposed direction to the first three, Sebastian Gardner (2009) insists that, while Nietzsche was sometimes tempted by skepticism about a self that can turn away from inclination requests and control them, his own doctrines on value creation and self-overcoming actually compromise him to something like a Kantian transcendental ego, despite his protests to the contrary.
Nietzsche's actual psychological explanations depend largely on appeals to sub-personal psychological attitudes. As Janaway observes (2009: 52), a large number of different types of attitude enter these accounts (including not only the standard beliefs and desires of current moral psychology, but also “wills”, feelings, sensations, moods, imaginations, memories, evaluations, convictions, and more), but possibly the central attitudes that work most for him are impulses and affects. These types of attitude have been studied intensively in recent works (see esp. Richardson 1996 and Katsafanas 2011b, 2013, 2016; see also Anderson 2012a, Clark and Dudrick 2015). Although much remains controversial, it is useful to think of impulses as provisions for general patterns of activity; they point to activity of the relevant type (e.g. a feed boost, an energy boost), and they also represent some more specific object or occasion of activity in a particular case (e.g. this ice cream, or overcoming a particular problem in the course of writing a document). Affections are emotional states that combine a receptive and felt response to the world with a tendency towards a distinctive pattern of reaction—states such as love, hatred, anger, fear, joy, etc. Typically, the sub-personal attitudes postulated in Nietzsche's psychological explanations represent the world in one way or another. Since it supports Leibniz's thought that representation, not consciousness, is the decisive mark of the mental (GS 354), it is reasonable to treat these attitudes as distinctly psychological, whether they are conscious or not.

"It began with a fake scallop, but a menu scandal that has engulfed some of Japan's most prestigious hotels and department stores now threatens to undermine Japan's international cuisine reputation.
Since a luxury hotel chain admitted to lying about the origin of ingredients on their menus, Japanese media have served almost daily revelations of similar transgressions by restaurants run by well-known hotels and department stores.
The frenzy began when the Osaka-based Hankyu-Hanshin hotel chain admitted that it had given false descriptions of dozens of menus at some of its restaurants between 2006 and October 2013, affecting some 78,000 diners.
Among the main minor offenses on the menu was a plate of red salmon caviar that turned out to be the less sumptuous eggs of flying fish.
A televised attempt by the president of the hotel group, Hiroshi Desaki, to limit the damage by announcing a 20% cut for himself and 10% for other executives, failed to appease angry consumers.
Days later, Desaki resigned, admitting that the hotel group had “betrayed our customers,” although he added: “We never intended to deceive them.” One of the hotel's chief chefs later declined a medal of honor to be received from the government.
So far, the company has reimbursed more than 10,000 consumers worth 20 million yen; the bill is expected to reach 110 million yen.
The Japanese version of the horsemeat scandal in the UK has since extended to several household names in the restoration. While, as in the United Kingdom, no one has fallen ill from eating ill-labelled products, the outbreak of anger shows no signs of diminishing. Consumers who thought they had eaten prized Kuruma prawns, for example, were told that they had actually eaten in the much cheaper version of the black tiger.
The first incident went almost unnoticed. The Prince Hotel in Tokyo was forced to confess after a diner complained on a blog that a ""callope"" dish he had ordered contained a similar but cheaper type of seafood.
The hotel started an investigation and then corrected more than 50 menus in dozens of its restaurants. His report frightened Hankyu-Hanshin and other hoteliers to admit that they, too, had fooled diners who believed they were paying high prices for premium ingredients.
The Okura Hotel chain – whose guests have included Barack Obama – confessed countless sins, including injecting fat beef to make it more juicy and incorrectly describe tomatoes as organic.
“We deeply apologize for betraying our customers’ expectations and trust,” he said in a statement.
The list of fraudulent ingredients continues to grow: orange juice from boxes sold as freshly squeezed; Mont Blanc desserts topped with Korean chestnuts instead of the promised French; chocolate cream bought disguised as homemade; imported meat sold as high-end wagyu.
Even the main government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, was moved to comment on the scandal. “These incidents have arisen one after the other and this inappropriate labelling has led to a loss of confidence among consumers,” he told reporters. “These are clearly cover-ups.”
The fraudulent menu scandal broke out at the wrong time. Japan was trying to persuade South Korea and other countries to lift the bans on food imports imposed in response to the Fukushima nuclear accident, while UNESCO was considering adding Japanese cuisine to its list of intangible cultural heritage.
A local newspaper published the headline, “The Proud Food Culture of Japan in Tears,” while mass circulation Yomiuri Shimbun said “was amazed by the industry’s lack of morale.”
The newspaper expressed concern that the scandal could “damage the credibility of the brand Japan, products and services, which are praised by foreign countries and tourists for their safety.”
Industry experts said that the global financial crisis in 2008 had forced luxury hotels to reduce costs while trying to court diners with detailed menu descriptions.
“The menu descriptions were created to satisfy consumers’ preference for branded products, and when they could not get the ingredients indicated on the menu, hotels simply used food from different places of origin,” Hiroshi Tomozawa, a hotel and restaurant consultant, told Kyodo News.
Although they count the cost to their reputation, it is unlikely that the hotels and restaurants involved will face legal action. Menus are not covered by the law on agricultural regulations or by a new food labelling law that will enter into force in 2015. The only legal weapon of the authorities is a law prohibiting misleading representations of goods and services.
The industry's biggest nemesis will be the demanding and demanding consumers in Japan. In a 2009 survey conducted by an online restaurant guide, 72% of respondents said that provenance was the most important factor in selecting dishes from a menu, followed by caloric and nutritional details.

"Scientists have connected the brains of a couple of animals and allowed them to share sensory information in an important step towards what researchers call the world’s first “organic computer.”
The American team equipped two rats with devices called brain-brain interfaces that allow animals to collaborate on simple tasks to earn rewards, such as a drink of water. In a radical demonstration of technology, scientists used the Internet to connect the brains of two rats separated by thousands of miles, with one in the Duke University researchers' laboratory in Durham, North Carolina, and the other in Natal, Brazil.
Directed by Miguel Nicolelis, a pioneer of devices that allow paralyzed people to control computers and robotic arms with their thoughts, researchers say his latest work can allow multiple brains to connect to share information. “These experiments showed that we have established a sophisticated link of direct communication between brains,” Nicolelis said in a statement. “Basically, we are creating what I call an organic computer.”
Scientists demonstrated for the first time that rats can share and act on each other's sensory information by electrically connecting their brains through small networks of electrodes that reach the motor cortex, the brain region that processes movement.
The rats were trained to press a lever when a light lit above it. When they carried out the task correctly, they got a drink of water. To test the ability of animals to share brain information, they place rats in two separate compartments. Only a compartment had a light that lit above the lever. When the rat pressed the lever, an electronic version of his brain activity was sent directly to the brain of the other rat. In the trials, the second rat responded correctly to imported brain signals 70% of the time by pressing the lever.
Surprisingly, communication between rats was two-way. If the receiving rat failed in the task, the first rat was not rewarded with a drink, and seemed to change her behavior to make the task easier for her partner. In other experiments, rats collaborated in a task that required them to distinguish between narrow and wide openings using their moustaches.
In the final test, scientists connected rats on different continents and transmitted their brain activity back and forth over the Internet. “Even though the animals were on different continents, with the resulting noisy transmission and signal delays, they could still communicate,” said Miguel Pais-Vieira, the first author of the study. “This tells us that we could create a viable network of animal brains distributed in many different places.”
Nicolelis said the team is now working on ways to link the brains of several animals at once to solve more complex tasks. “We can’t even predict what kind of emerging properties would appear when animals start interacting as part of a’brain network’,” he said. “In theory, you could imagine that a combination of brains could provide solutions that individual brains cannot achieve on their own.” The research is published in Scientific Reports.
Anders Sandberg, who studies the ethics of neurotechnologies at the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University, said the work was “very important” to help understand how brain information is coded. But the implications of technology and its possible future uses are much broader, Sandberg said. “The main reason we are leading the planet is that we are incredibly good at communication and coordination. Without that, although we are very intelligent animals, we would not dominate the planet.”
“I don’t think there is any risk of survival rats for this,” he added. “There is a big difference between sharing sensory information and being able to plan. I'm not worried about an imminent invasion of rat multiborgs.
Very little is known about how thoughts are coded and how they could be transmitted to another person's brain, so it is not a realistic prospect at any time. And a lot of what is in our minds is what Sandberg calls a “project” of what we could do. “We often don’t want to reveal those drafts; that would be embarrassing and confusing. And many of those drafts have changed before we act. Most of the time I think we would be very grateful not to be in someone else’s head.”",C2
"Not only the identity of the man in the parking lot with the crooked spine, but the terrible last moments and humiliating treatment of Richard III's naked body in the hours after his death have been revealed at an extraordinary press conference at the University of Leicester.
There was applause when Richard Buckley, Chief Archeologist in the search for the king’s body, finally announced that the university team was convinced “beyond reasonable doubt” that he had found the last King Plantagenet, bent by the scoliosis of the spine, and further twisted to fit into a hole dug hastily in the church of the grey friars, which was slightly too small to hold his body.
But, by then, it was clear that the evidence was overwhelming, as the scientists who carried out the DNA tests, those who created computer engineering technology to look into and into the bones in extraordinary detail, the genealogists who found a distant descendant with DNA at stake, and the academics who went through contemporary texts for the King's death and burial accounts outlined their findings.
What a morning. What a story,” said Philippa Langley of the Ricardo III Society. She had been driving the project for years, faced with the disbelief of many people, and the search for funds from all over the world when it seemed as if the money would run out before the excavation had begun.
A new tomb has begun to be designed in Leicester Cathedral, just 100 metres from the excavation site, and a ceremony will be held to put it in its new tomb there, probably next year. Leicester Museum Service is working on plans for a new visitor centre in an old school building overlooking the site.
Richard died in Bosworth on August 22, 1485, the last English king to fall into battle, and researchers revealed how for the first time. There was an audible breath when a slide appeared showing the base of his skull cut by a terrible blow, which is believed to be from a halberd, a fearsome medieval battle weapon with a sharp iron axe blade weighing about two kilos, mounted on a wooden pole, which was turned to Richard at very short distance. The blade probably penetrated several centimeters into his brain and, said human bone expert Jo Appleby, he would have been unconscious immediately and dead almost as soon.
The injury seems to confirm contemporary accounts that he died in close combat in the bulk of the battle and without riding, as in Shakespeare’s great desperate cry to him: “A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!” Another sword, which also crossed the bone and entered the brain, would also have been fatal. But many of the other wounds were after death, suggesting a horrifying ritual on the battlefield and when the king's body was brought back to Leicester, when he was stripped, mocked and mutilated.
A terrible injury, a stab wound through the right buttock and pelvis, was certainly after death and could not have occurred when his lower body was protected by armor. He suggests that the story that his naked corpse was brought back sunk on a horse, mocked and abused all the way, is true. Bob Savage, an expert in medieval weapons from the Royal Armouries who helped identify the wounds, said it was probably not a weapon of war, but the kind of sharp knife or dagger any worker could have carried.
Michael Ibsen, the Canadian-born furniture manufacturer, proved to be the descendant of Richard's sister, heard confirmation on Sunday and heard evidence unfolding in scandalized silence. “My head is not clearer now than when I first heard the news,” he said. “Many, many hundreds of people died in that camp that day. He was a king, but only one of the dead. He lived in very violent times and these deaths would not have been quick or beautiful.”
It was Mathew Morris who first discovered the body, in the first hour of the first day of the excavation. I didn't think I found the king. The mechanical excavator was still chewing on the road to the council parking lot, identified by years of research by local historians and the Richard III Society as the likely location of the lost church of grey friars, whose priests courageously claimed the king's body and buried it in a grave excavated hastily, probably still naked, but in a position of honor near the main altar of his church. The bones of the legs that were shown across the earth were covered again.
Ten days later, on September 5, when a new dig showed that Morris had reached the crucial point, he returned with Lin Foxhall, head of the archaeology department, to dig the body. “We did it the usual way, lifting up arms, legs and skull first, and gradually advancing toward the torso – so that’s only when we finally saw the crooked thorn that I thought: ‘My word, I think we have it. '""
As for Langley, Richard was the true king, the last king of the north, a worthy and courageous leader who became the victim of some of the brightest propaganda in history, in the hands of Tudor image creator Shakespeare. There remains the dark shadow of the little princes in the tower, an infamous story even in the days of Richard: the boy Edward V and his brother Richard were declared illegitimate when Richard III claimed the throne, imprisoned in the Tower of London and never again seen alive. Although it is by no means certain that the bones found in the tower centuries later are theirs, there may be more DNA detective work to do there.

"The reality television with law enforcement in the rhythm is nothing new. However, a spectacle with a man of law who makes prisoners in prison wear pink underwear and use actors to trick suspects is a new twist.
Maricopa Co.. Sheriff Joe Arpaio now has his own TV show, Smile: You are under arrest.
Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, whose ostentatious brand of justice has raised allegations of discrimination and abuses of civil rights while making him a hero among fans of his harsh attitude against crime, will star Smile: You're Under Arrested.
The show, which premieres this weekend on Fox Reality Channel, features Arpaio and other officers using stratagems developed by comedy writers and carried out by professional actors to arrest suspects with pending court orders.
In one, a suspect is invited to a fake fashion session and told him he's going to become a supermodel, according to Fox Reality's website. In another, a suspect is deceived into what he thinks is a job as an extra movie and, after a staged discussion between the director of the film and another actor, is promoted to the star role.
It's fun to show how stupid they are and, as I say, the looks on his face, 76-year-old Arpaio said of suspects wanted by DUI, drug charges, missing court dates, and other crimes. Look Arpaio explain his methods
But Arpaio's critics don't have fun.
They say they fear the program will give positive publicity to the controversial sheriff, ignoring what they call a darker side of his 16-year term as the highest legislator in the county that includes Phoenix.
He's going to celebrate a sheriff who frankly scares this community, a sheriff who's seen violent crimes increase significantly in his county, a sheriff who's racially profiling the Latino community, and I doubt the program will reflect that, said Paco Fabian, spokesman for the America's Voice immigrant rights group.
In a statement on the group's website, Fabian calls Arpaio a today's Bull Connor, comparing him to the 1960 public security commissioner Birmingham, Alabama, whose use of attack dogs and firefires on civil rights protesters made him a symbol of racial intolerance.
Dubbed America's Tooughest Sheriff, Arpaio makes many of his county's 10,000 prisoners live in tents. He reinstated chained gangs -- including gangs for women and youth -- forbade smoking, coffee and movies in their prisons and, more recently, asked all prisoners with money in their prison accounts to pay for their own meals.
And then, of course, there's pink underwear.
They were stealing their white underwear, taking their underwear out of jail, Arpaio told CNN. You know what? Give them pink. The other reason is they hate rose. Why would you give the 10,000 inmates the color they like?
Earlier this year, the mayor of Phoenix wrote a letter to the U.S. Attorney General's office, asking the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice's civil rights division. to investigate Arpaio's aggressive illegal immigration measures. Mayor Phil Brown wrote that Arpaio's sweeps show a pattern and practice of conduct that includes discriminatory harassment, inadequate stops, searches and arrests.
The letter came after Arpaio, who had already been the target of hundreds of lawsuits, launched a series of what he calls crime suppression patrols in largely Latino neighborhoods. Critics say patrols use racial profiling to unfairly attack Hispanic drivers and pedestrians, while Arpaio says they have resulted in the deportation of hundreds of illegal immigrants, including some with a criminal record.
“We are the only ones fighting against the law of smuggling human beings from the state,” Arpaio said.
Fabian said America's Voice is considering pressuring the companies they advertise during the Arpaio show. Either way, the series offers another moment in the spotlight for a man of the law who has never strayed from it.
“I will not brag,” Arpaio said, “but there is no one in the world who does not know who this sheriff is.”

Asian video crash: Firefighters saw girl hurt before being hit
Asian Airlines Flight 214 crashed in San Francisco on July 6.
The Boeing 777 operated by Asiana fell short of its approach and crashed on the runway at San Francisco International Airport. Three people died and more than 180 were injured.
The claim alleges that some aircraft equipment was poorly installed or defective, resulting in inappropriate warnings for pilots about low air speed.
Boeing was aware that its low-speed air alert system was inadequate, according to the suit.
More than 80 of the 291 passengers on the plane are named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit.
Pilot worried about the landing plane before crashing
As a result of the accident, each claimant suffered injuries, including, inter alia, bodily injury and resulting pain and suffering, disability, mental distress, loss of ability to enjoy life, medical treatment, loss of income and medical expenses, on demand.
CNN contacted Boeing to comment on the lawsuit. Company spokesman Doug Alder refused to comment.
The passengers represented by the Ribbeck Act began their legal proceedings shortly after the accident, filing a petition for Boeing to give evidence to the plaintiffs.
At that time, the law firm said it was considering adding Asiana and certain parts manufacturers to the lawsuit, but Friday's presentation named only Boeing, Kelly said.

"There are several paradoxical elements in Camus' approach to philosophy. In his long-lasting essay, The Myth of Sisyphus, Camus presents a philosophy that disputes philosophy itself. This essay belongs directly to the philosophical tradition of existentialism, but Camus denied being existentialist. Both The Myth of Sisyphus and his other philosophical work, The Rebel, are systematically skeptical of the conclusions about the meaning of life, yet both works objectively assert valid answers to key questions about how to live. Although Camus seemed modest in describing his intellectual ambitions, he had sufficient confidence as a philosopher to articulate not only his own philosophy, but also a critique of religion and a fundamental critique of modernity. While rejecting the very idea of a philosophical system, Camus built his own original building of ideas around the key terms of absurdity and rebellion, with the aim of solving the problems of life or death that motivated him.
The essential paradox that arises in Camus' philosophy refers to his central notion of absurdity. Accepting the Aristotelian idea that philosophy begins with astonishment, Camus argues that human beings cannot escape by asking the question, “What is the meaning of existence?” Camus, however, denies that there is an answer to this question, and rejects any scientific, teleological, metaphysical or man-made purpose that provides an adequate answer. Thus, while accepting that human beings inevitably seek to understand the purpose of life, Camus takes the skeptical position that the natural world, the universe, and human enterprise remain silent about any purpose. Since existence itself makes no sense, we must learn to endure an irresolvable vacuum. This paradoxical situation, then, between our impulse to ask final questions and the impossibility of achieving an adequate answer, is what Camus calls absurd. Camus' philosophy of absurdity explores the consequences of this basic paradox.
Camus' understanding of the absurd is better captured in an image, not in an argument: of Sisyphus who strives to push his rock up the mountain, watching it roll, then descending after the rock to begin everywhere, in an endless cycle. Like Sisyphus, human beings cannot help but ask about the meaning of life, just to see our answers fall again. If we accept this thesis on the essential absurdity of life, and Camus' antiphilosophical approach to philosophical questions, we cannot fail to ask ourselves: What role remains for rational analysis and argument? Does not the philosopher Camus preside over the death of philosophy by answering the question of whether to commit suicide by leaving the realm of discussion and analysis and turning to metaphor to answer it? If life does not have a fundamental purpose or meaning that reason can articulate, we cannot help but wonder why we continue to live and reason. Could Silenus not be right to declare that it would have been better not to be born, or to die as soon as possible? [1] And, as Francisco Jeanson wrote long before his famous criticism of El Rebel that precipitated the break between Camus and Sartre, is not absurd philosophy a contradiction in terms, strictly speaking no philosophy but an anti-rational posture that ends in silence (Jeanson 1947)?
Was Camus really a philosopher? He himself said no, in a famous interview with Jeanine Delpech at Les Nouvelles Littéraires in November 1945, insisting that he “did not believe enough in reason to believe in a system” (Camus 1965, 1427). It was not simply a public position, as we find the same thought in his notebooks of this period: he describes himself as an artist and not as a philosopher because “I think according to words and not according to ideas” (Camus 1995, 113). However, Jean-Paul Sartre immediately saw that Camus was carrying out an important philosophical work, and in his review of The Stranger in relation to Sisyphus, he had no trouble connecting Camus with Pascal, Rousseau and Nietzsche (Sartre 1962). After becoming friends Sartre publicly spoke of his friend’s “philosophy of the absurd,” which distinguished him from his own thinking by accepting the “existentialist” label that Camus rejected. In the years since then, the apparent anti-systematic and non-systematic character of his philosophy has meant that relatively few scholars have appreciated all its depth and complexity. They have more often praised their imposing literary achievements and presented themselves as a political moralist, while pointing out their dubious claims and problematic arguments (see Sherman 2008). A recent major exception to this is Ronald Srigley's Critique of Modernity by Albert Camus (Srigley 2011).
This entry will negotiate Camus' deliberate ambivalence as a philosopher as he discusses his philosophy. It is not just a matter of giving a philosophical reading of this playwright, journalist, essayist and novelist, but of taking his philosophical writings seriously, exploring their premises, their evolution, their structure and their coherence. To do so is to see that your writing contains more than a mood and more than sweeping images and affirmations, without support, although it contains many of both. Camus takes his skepticism as far as possible as a form of methodical doubt — that is, part of a presumption of skepticism — until he finds the basis for a non-sceptical conclusion. And it builds a unique philosophical construction, whose premises are often left unmentioned and not always clearly discussed, but developed in different stages throughout its brief life. Camus' philosophy can be read as well as a sustained effort to demonstrate and not just affirm what the absurdity of human existence implies. In the Camus process, he answers the questions posed by The Myth of Sisyphus, ""Why shouldn't I kill myself? ""and by El Rebel, ""Why shouldn't I kill others?""",C2

extracting sets of informational characteristics, has recently been revolutionized by several deep learning paradigms from end to end, for example,
convolutional neural networks (CNN) [6], recurrent neural networks
networks (RNN) [7] and autocoders [8]. The success of
deep learning in many domains is partly attributed to the
rapid development of computational resources (e.g. GPU),
the availability of large training data, and the effectiveness of

(e.g. images, text and videos). Taking the image data as a

example, we can represent an image as a regular grid in
Euclidean space. A Convolutional Neuronal Network (CNN)
is capable of exploiting shift variation, local connectivity, and
composition of image data [9]. As a result, CNNs can
extract significant local characteristics that are shared with the whole
data sets for various image analysis.
While deep learning effectively captures hidden patterns of
Euclidean data, there are an increasing number of applications
where the data is represented in the form of graphs. For example, in e-commence, a graphics-based learning system can
take advantage of the interactions between users and products to make
very precise recommendations. In chemistry, molecules
they are modeled as graphs, and their bioactivity has to be
identified for drug discovery. In a dating network, presentations
are linked to each other through dating vessels and which they need to
be categorized into different groups. The complexity of the chart
the data have imposed significant challenges on the existing machine
Learning algorithms. As graphics can be irregular, a graph can
has a variable size of unordered nodes, and nodes of a
graph may have a different number of neighbors, resulting
in some important operations (e.g. developments) it is easy
to calculate in the domain of the image, but difficult to apply to
the domain of the graph. In addition, a basic assumption of the existence of
machine learning algorithms is that instances are independent
each other. This assumption is no longer valid for graphical data
because each instance (node) is related to others by links of
various types, such as dating, friendships, and interactions.
Lately, there is a growing interest in expanding
learning approaches to graphical data. Motivated by CNNs,
The NNRs and deep learning autocoders, the new generalizations and definitions of important operations have been:
quickly developed in recent years to manage the complexity of graphical data. For example, a graphical convolution can
be generalized from a 2D convolution. As illustrated in the figure
1, an image can be considered as a special case of graphics
where pixels are connected by adjacent pixels. Similar to 2D
convolution, you can make graphic convolutions by taking
the weighted average of the neighborhood information of a node.

of the graphic neural networks (GNNs). Using the Geometric Term

I. INTRODUCTION
One of the main objectives of the field of artificial intelligence
(AI) is to produce fully autonomous agents that interact with
your environment to learn optimal behaviors, improving about
time through trial and error. Development of AI systems that are
receptive and able to learn effectively has been a long
challenge, ranging from robots, who can feel and react
the world around them, the software-based agents,
they can interact with natural and multimedia language.
A principled mathematical framework for experience
Autonomous learning is reinforced learning (RL) [135]. Although RL had some successes in the past [141, 129, 62, 93],
previous approaches lacked scalability and were intrinsically
limited to rather low dimensional problems. These limitations
exist because RL algorithms share the same complexity problems as other algorithms: the complexity of memory, computational
complexity, and in the case of machine learning algorithms,
complexity of the sample [133]. What we have witnessed in recent years
years—the increase in deep learning, relying on the powerful
approximation of functions and representation of learning properties
of deep neural networks — it has provided us with new tools for
overcome these problems.
The advent of deep learning has had a significant impact
in many areas of machine learning, drastically improving
the state of the art in tasks such as object detection, speech
language recognition and translation [70]. The Most Important
deep learning property is that deep neural networks can
automatically find compact low-dimensional representations
(characteristics) of high-dimensional data (e.g. images, text and
audio). Through the development of inductive biases in the neural network
architectures, in particular that of hierarchical representations,
Machine learning professionals have made effective progress
when addressing the curse of dimensionality [15]. Deep Learning
has similarly accelerated progress in RL, with the use of
deep learning algorithms within RL that define the
“Deep reinforcement learning” (DRL). The objective of this survey
should cover both seminal and recent evolution of LRD,
transmit innovative ways in which neural networks can
to be used to approach autonomous development
Agents. For a more comprehensive study of recent efforts in
DRL, including applications of DRL in areas such as natural areas
language processing [106, 5], we refer readers to the overview
by Li [78].
Deep learning enables RL to scale up decision-making
problems that were previously intractable, i.e. adjustments with
spaces of action and state of high dimension. Among the last
work in the field of the DRL, there have been two
success stories. The first, starting the revolution in DRL,
was the development of an algorithm that could learn to play
a range of Atari 2600 video games at a superhuman level,
directly from image pixels [84]. Provide solutions for the
the instability of function approximation techniques in RL,
work was the first to show convincingly that RL agents
could be trained in raw, high-dimensional observations only
based on a reward signal. The second notable success was
the development of a hybrid DRL system, AlphaGo, which
defeated a champion of the human world in Go [128], parallel to the
IBM Deep Blue's historical achievements in chess two decades
previous [19] and IBM's Watson DeepQA system that beat the
Best human Jeopardy! players [31]. Unlike the handmade ones
rules that have dominated chess game systems, AlphaGo
was composed of neural networks that were trained using
supervised and reinforced learning, in combination with
a traditional heuristic search algorithm.
DRL algorithms have already been applied to a wide range
problems, such as robotics, where control policies for robots
now you can learn directly from the camera entries in the real
world [74, 75], the successive controllers that used to be designed by hand or learned from low-dimensional characteristics of the
The robot's condition. In a step towards even more capable agents,
DRL has been used to create agents that can meta-learn (“learn
learning”) [29, 156], which allows them to generalize complexes
visual environments that you have never seen before [29]. In
Figure 1, show just some of the domains that DRL
has been applied, ranging from playing video games [84]
Inland waterways [167].
Video games can be an interesting challenge, but learn
how to play them is not the ultimate goal of DRL. One of the
the driving forces behind DRL is the vision of creating systems
who are able to learn to adapt in the real world.
From energy consumption management [142] to collection and
stowage objects [75], DRL represents to increase the amount
of physical tasks that can be automated by learning. However, DRL does not stop there, as RL is a general form of

"Thousands of anti-coup protesters marched in towns and cities across Myanmar on Monday, witnesses said, demonstrating for a third day in a row against the removal and detention of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi a week ago.

Calls to join the protests and support a campaign of civil disobedience have become increasingly strong and organized since last Monday's coup, which attracted widespread international condemnation.
In Yangon's largest city, a group of saffron monks marched in the vanguard of Monday's protest with workers and students. They flew multicolored Buddhist flags alongside red banners in the color of the Suu Kyi National League for Democracy (NLD), witnesses said.
“Free our leaders, respect our votes, reject the military coup,” a signal said. Other signs say “Save democracy” and “Say No to Dictatorship”. Many protesters wore black.
Protests sweeping the country on Sunday were the largest since the “saffron revolution” led by Buddhist monks in 2007 that helped push for democratic reforms that were overturned by the February 1 coup.
“Marchers from every corner of Yangon, please go out peacefully and join the people’s meeting,” activist Ei Thinzar Maung urged his followers on Facebook, using VPN networks to mobilize protesters despite an attempt by the junta to ban social media.
Thousands marched in the coastal city of Dawei, in the southeast, and in the capital of Kachin State, in the far north, where they were dressed in black.
So far, the meetings have been peaceful, unlike the bloody repressions during the previous widespread protests in 1988 and 2007. A convoy of military trucks was seen passing to Yangon at the end of Sunday, which increases fears that could change.
Reuters has not been able to contact the board to comment on the protests and state television has not mentioned them.
The government lifted a one-day internet ban on the weekend that sparked even more anger in a country fearful of returning to isolation and greater poverty before the transition to democracy began in 2011.
Activists Maung Saungkha and Thet Swe Win posted on their Facebook pages that the police had been searching their homes, but that they were not there and were still free.
In addition to street protests, a campaign of civil disobedience has begun, first with doctors and along with some teachers and other government workers.
“We asked government staff from all departments not to attend work from Monday,” said activist Min Ko Naing, a veteran of the 1988 demonstrations that first highlighted Suu Kyi.
He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for campaigning for democracy, and spent nearly 15 years under house arrest during decades of struggle to end nearly half a century of army rule.
Suu Kyi, 75, has been held incommunicado since Army Chief Min Aung Hlaing took power in the early hours of 1 February.
He faces charges of illegal importation of six walkie-talkies and is detained by the police for investigation until 15 February. His lawyer said he wasn't allowed to see her.
The United Nations Security Council called for the release of Suu Kyi and other detainees last week and the United States is considering targeted sanctions.
“Protestors in Myanmar continue to inspire the world as actions spread across the country,” said United Nations Special Rapporteur on Myanmar Thomas Andrews on Twitter. “Myanmar stands up to release all those who have been arrested and reject the military dictatorship once and for all. We're with you.",C2
"Like Franz Rosenzweig (who goes a long way in The Star of Redemption and Understanding of the Sick and Healthy to show that God, man and the world support three fundamentally different and irreducible bases of explanation that have shaped our history), Rosenstock-Huessy was convinced that the attempt of humanism to free itself from all gods (making humanity and/or nature the foundation of reality) was based on the inability to grasp older ideas about the nature of the real and the relationship between reality, language and history. To this important measure, again like Rosenzweig, he argued that language was more fundamental than philosophy or religion and the attempt of philosophy to liberate itself and reduce religion to a deficient type of philosophy was based on its failure to take language, and therefore reality, seriously enough. As a letter to Cynthia Harris would say: ‘Not religion but language compels man to distinguish between this world and the real world, the world as we know it and the genuine, or better known world. The quid of theology is a quid of language, and all our rationalists do not protest against religion, but against speech’ (1943, 162).
But unlike Karl Barth or Paul Tillich, for example, who saw themselves as a philosophy of fusion and theology, Rosenstock-Huessy refused to see himself primarily as a philosopher or theologian, although when the term philosopher was termed by the former ‘social’, he was more willing to accept that designation. [2] His criticisms of theology and philosophy were numerous, varied in content and highly nuanced, and therefore unable to receive a complete treatment here. In general, however, he thought they were both, what he called, ‘second-order activities’, or mind-reflective products in the ‘game’. The philosophical and theological discourse was left behind and depended on the most urgent and creative acts of ‘foundation’, that is, those acts that emerge from the demands of life, that are epochs that make ‘events’ and that are at the source of human institutions and new forms of life, and that cannot be separated from vocabulary, or, more specifically, from the shared names and foci of orientation that connect us through space and time. [3] In the most philosophical of all his works, the first volume of his Soziologie, contrasting the respective limits of theology with philosophy, says that theology is guilty of reducing us to sinners and angels and therefore not adequately account for our being flesh and blood, while philosophers tend to reduce us to objects and things in the dead space of the universe and to ""reflect the objective world in their subjective world"" (1956, 286). ""Religion,"" he says in the same section, ""is unjust against nature and the human spirit (Geist)"", while philosophy is blind to ""the forces that give time"" (""die zeitstiftenden Gewalten""). [4]
Against philosophers and theologians, he saw his task as restoring our tune to the powers embedded in our discourse and institutions so that we could harness the power of past times in order to strengthen our openness to the promise of the future in the present. To this end, while his corpus encompasses numerous disciplines, his main systematic work, rewritten one throughout his life, was his two parts Sociology Im Kreuz der Wirchlichkeit (On the Cross of Reality)—the first volume of which will appear with Transaction in 2017: volume one originally appeared (to use the English title) in 1925 as The Forces of the Community, and then reworked as The Hegemony of Spaces; volume two being The Count Complete of Times. His social philosophy refers to how, when a world implodes or devours them—through what he calls the four social diseases of anarchy, decay, revolution and war (1970a, 11-16)—people can escape the tyranny of the forces that have come to govern the space in which they live by founding a new time that will then open up other space possibilities. For him, then, the key to human freedom is the ability both to found the new and to harness the powers encapsulated in bodies of the past that allow us to live in a present in which we feel blessed by the future. Rosenstock-Huessy repeatedly maintains that philosophy in general is particularly weak to help us in this task and that, ultimately, Rosenstock-Huessy became sociology as ""the way to regain our freedom over spaces and through times"" (2009,1, 22). Therefore, against the Cartesian cogito, which he saw as the basis of the formulation of the philosophy of modernity, Rosenstock-Huessy replicates with the far more archaic Respondéo etsi mutabor—‘I answer though I will be changed’ (1938, 817-830; 1970b, 17-33). In other words, we are fundamentally receptive creatures—and our creations are shaped by our responses to the weight and thrust of the past, the burdens or joys of the present, or the attraction and call of the future. As Vico, whom Rosenstock-Huessy admired a lot, believes that we are inevitably rooted in history, even though our great revolutions try to tear us out of it, in order to start again and build a much better world, thus opening up new ways of self-being. [5]
The main deficiency of philosophy, for Rosenstock-Huessy, is that it is not sufficiently sensitive to time, speech or history. To a large extent this is because the logic itself is timeless. As it says in ‘The Terms of the Creed’, ‘logic is that spiritual way of life in which the divinity of time is omitted.’ Logic transports us out of time and offers the mind a stable but unreal space. For Rosenstock-Huessy, this search for a stable space is reflected in recurring philosophical elements that favour the implacability of space (or a particular space) over the incessantness of time. The division of things into subject and object of modern philosophy (space configuration) is an example, but it goes back to the ancient ones whose building blocks as themes (from the place moles), ‘categories’ (from kata = ‘down’ and agora = ‘public assembly’, that is. To proclaim in the assembly, the sphericality of reason, and ideas (the same term idea, eidein = ‘see’, referring to something visible to the eye of the mind) all suggest a commitment to the primacy of space (the mental). The same point is made somewhat more elaborate in the first volume of the In the Cross of Reality (2009, 1,307 – 311) where he argues that dialectic thought is triadic, but anything that really happens and manifests itself, that is. appears (erscheint), is at least quadrilateral. [6] It must be something in space and time, and therefore conform to the inner/exterior or subjective/objective matrix of space, as well as to the trajectory and prejective of time. He called this matrix quadruple the cross of reality and is repeatedly applied through his works.
While Rosenstock-Huessy provided a series of arguments against philosophers who want to make more of reason and less of the language, time and history than their due, and although he preferred to be classified as a sociologist, he can also be seen as a social philosopher who argued the philosophical need for the fusion of history, linguistics, anthropology, sociology and religion. Franz Rosenzweig certainly saw Rosenstock-Huessy in this light, and once said to him: ‘You have never... been anything to me but a ‘philosopher’’ (1969, 82). [7] In this regard it belongs to that long line of critics of philosophy ranging from the ancients to the modern and comic poets to religious thinkers, from Aristotle to Lucian, to Rabelais, from Tatian to Tertullian to Luther, and Pascal to Marx and Nietzsche. All these critics have provided criticisms of philosophy that have ended, in different ways, and at different times, transforming the direction and content of philosophy.",C2
"Foot was one of the pioneers of writing on questions of applied ethics, the treatment of abortion and euthanasia. For reasons only explicit in later writings, Foot rejects consistent views of value, including utilitarianism. Charity, for its part, demands that we help others, but we cannot do so at the expense of violating the rights to non-interference or negative rights. As Foot says, “to the extent that man’s charity is limited only by his righteousness... he is no less than perfect in charity” (Md 57). But what does justice demand? For Foot, answering this question depends on finding out the scope of our moral rights, and this is a project she carried out reflecting on several thought experiments, some of which have entered popular culture.
Consider a couple of scenarios called Rescue I and Rescue II (MD 80). In both cases, we are driving a jeep along a shore of the sea and we have the opportunity to save several configurations of stranded people from an incoming tide. In the first case, we're about to save one person from the tide, and detect another five we can save, but we can't save both. In Rescue II, we can save five, but to reach them, for some reason we would have to run over a person, killing him. Pie believes that there is a morally significant difference between these cases. She thinks it is inadmissible to save the five in Rescue II; while it is permissible (at least) to save the five in Rescue I. In Foot's view, the significant difference lies in the fact that in Rescue II, saving all five would require initiating a causal sequence that kills one. In Rescue I, on the contrary, saving the five is permissible because in this scenario we allow a mortal causal sequence that we do not initiate to follow its course. This does not mean that all instances of allowing mortal causal sequences to run their course are permissible, or that the distinction between doing and allowing always makes a difference in the moral state of an action. The assertion is only that distinction sometimes makes a significant moral difference, as it does in this couple of cases. According to Foot, “more is needed to justify interference than to justify the retention of goods and services” (MD 83). At least, this means that it is inadmissible to kill one person to save another. [5] This distinction refers to the distinction between negative rights, rights to non-interference, versus positive rights, which oblige others to provide some service. Negative rights would oblige others not to initiate a fatal causal sequence, and positive rights may result in an obligation to prevent a fatal causal sequence from continuing. Foot's claim is that negative rights have more weight than positive rights.
In “The Problem of Abortion and the Doctrine of the Double Effect”, (1967) Foot raises a related case that has been the subject of much further discussion: an uncontrolled cart is directed towards five people who will be killed by the collision, but could be directed to a track where there is only one person (VV 23). Intuitively, it seems permissible to turn the cart to hit and kill a person, but the problem is that it does not seem permissible to kill one to save five in cases like Rescue II. Why, Foot asks, can't we argue for the permissibility of killing one to save five in those cases by appealing to the Trolley case? As we have seen, Foot argues that negative rights are generally stronger than positive rights. In Rescue II, we must violate someone's negative rights in order to satisfy the positive rights of others, and this is unacceptable because negative rights have priority over positive rights that are not offset by the need for assistance of five people. In Trolley, on the contrary, we are not violating negative rights to comply with positive rights; the situation faces the negative rights of the five against the negative rights of one, and both options involve violating someone's negative rights. In such a case, it seems clearly preferable to minimise the violation of negative rights by turning the car (VV 27).
In Foot's view, we are generally not allowed to do anything that interferes with someone's negative rights, for example, we cannot steal someone's property; however, we may not be required to actively secure their possession, that is, we may allow them to lose their property. In this way, Foot defends a principle that establishes a moral distinction between doing and allowing; it also defends a version of the doctrine of double effect, which states that it is sometimes permissible to produce a result that is foreseen as a result of one's action, but which does not pretend that it is inadmissible to aim as a means or as an end (MD 91). Pie believes that this principle is necessary because the principle of making and allowing does not cover some morally significant distinctions. For example, consider a case where we own a certain drug, but only enough to cure a person who suffers from a fatal condition, or to save five others who are suffering from a milder, though still fatal, disease. In such a circumstance, we can allow the medication to be given to the five who are suffering in the mildest form of the disease. If we could save the six, we'd probably do it. Clearly, we have no intention of one's death, even though we foresee it as a consequence of our actions. On the other hand, it is not permissible to retain a life-saving drug to use its organs to save the lives of the other five after they die. In this case, one's death is an essential means to the attainment of the end and therefore his death is strictly intentional. Although in such a case I would be allowing someone to die instead of perpetrating a murder by my own agency, what I do is inadmissible. Only the doctrine of double effect captures the distinction between these cases, according to Foot's point of view. However, the doctrine of double effect cannot be upheld alone, according to Foot; we need both the principle of double effect and the principle of doing and allowing. After all, sometimes we can initiate damage impermissibly with indirect intent. She gives the example of the evil traders who knowingly sell the poisoned oil: their intention is not to harm their customers, but only to make profits, however, they are clearly starting a harmful causal sequence.
These principles systematize the non-consequential ‘common moral’, and Foot puts these principles into use in its treatment of abortion and euthanasia. Pie is skeptical of any attempt to resolve the debate on abortion without resolving the question of whether and when the fetus has moral rights, and she considers it an intractable issue (MD 87). In this view, she takes sides against Judith Jarvis Thomson, who argued that some abortions are permissible even if we allow for the argument that the fetus has a complete moral status. Thomson argues by analogy: Imagine that while we sleep a group of music lovers stealthily unite us to a famous violinist who is suffering from a disease, and we can keep him alive for about nine months, as he is convalescent (Thomson 1971: 48). The question is: can we separate the violinist, causing his death? Thomson argues that we can, since our negative rights have been violated and no one has the right to use someone else's body, even to save their own life. Of course, the analogy here is limited to cases of non-consensual impregnation, such as those resulting from the violation.
Foot argues that the analogy has a devastating flaw. There is a morally significant difference between unhooking someone from one's own body, which does not imply initiating a fatal causal sequence, since the person was already in the grip of a fatal condition before being hooked on us, and abortion, which does initiate a fatal sequence. Foot thinks this makes abortion look like Rescue II, while the violinist's unhook is like Rescue I. As Foot says,
the fetus is not in danger because it is in the womb of its mother; it simply depends on it in the way the children depend on their parents for food. (MD 87)
Rejecting Thomson's point of view, which attempts to show that some cases of abortion are permissible even if the fetus is fully a moral person, Foot's considered position on abortion is that it revolves precisely on the question Thomson wishes to put aside. On this subject, she surprisingly abandons her commitment to objectivity, stating that it is a matter for a community to decide whether to count the fetus as a human being (MD 7).
Perhaps Foot’s most penetrating article on applied ethics is his “Eutanasia” (1977). Foot defines euthanasia as a murder that is for the good of the individual in question, and she asks if such an act can be permissible. A central question here is whether it can be good for an individual to be deprived of his life, and therefore one of Foot's central purposes is to determine what kind of good life is for a person. She rejects the narrow hedonistic view that the value of life is determined by the balance of pleasure versus the pain it promises. In his opinion, life often remains a good for someone who is suffering and who is likely to continue in such a state. However, he also argues that simply being alive without suffering is not a good (VV 42). What has value, in his view, is ordinary human life which contains at least a minimum of “basic human goods”, including:
that a man is not driven to work far beyond his ability; that he has the support of a family or community; that he can more or less satisfy his hunger; that he has hope for the future; that he can rest at night. (ibid.)
In the absence of such minimum goods, he argues that life is not a good for a person.
The question of the permissibility of euthanasia to the foot, then, concerns questions of justice and charity (VV 44). In his view, even if it seems better that someone does not survive, we must respect that person’s rights. Therefore, in his opinion, involuntary active euthanasia can never be permissible. On the other hand, the right to assistance in keeping alive requires the charity of others and not justice, except in the case of a doctor who has a contractual duty to help us stay alive. However, even in the case of a doctor, where assistance is a matter of justice, our claim to such assistance is limited by the claims of others, as well as by respect for our well-being. That is, there may come a time when such ‘assistance’ as a doctor can offer to prolong a patient’s life does not really confer any benefit, and in such a case, it is not contrary to justice or charity that the doctor holds back treatment; as Foot points out, such cases of passive euthanasia are already widely practiced (VV 56). However, he argues that it may be justifiable not to prolong the life of someone who wants to live, giving the example of a dying soldier whose life could be prolonged with a certain drug, but who would therefore face death by starvation. According to Foot, passive non-voluntary euthanasia is permissible in such a case.
Of course, the central controversy here is whether active voluntary euthanasia is permissible. He dismisses James Rachels' claim that if we allow passive euthanasia, then the only consistent position is to allow active euthanasia in similar circumstances because it is ""more human"" than passive euthanasia (Rachels 1975). Foot argues by analogy that it may be ‘more human’ to deprive someone of the property that is bringing him evil, but removing it would be contrary to justice (VV 50). On the other hand, someone can give permission for the destruction of their property, and as Foot concludes,
If someone gives you permission to destroy your property you can no longer say that you have no right to do so, and I don't see why it shouldn't be the same with taking a man's life. (VV 53)
However, Foot admits that the moral question is not fully resolved by the question of rights, so it does not follow that there is no moral objection to doing something because it would not imply any violation of rights. So it's about whether it would be good for the person to die and, therefore, if it would be contrary to charity. This rules out cases where death is desired by someone who faces a life of dependence because they are concerned about being a burden to others. In such circumstances, being other things the same, death would not be for the good of the person. Foot also has concerns about the practice of euthanasia that make her hesitate to suggest that the practice should be more widely legalized.",C2
"Unfortunately, Nietzsche’s ideas about the nature of value creation and his suggestions about what specific values should be “created” have not seemed so clear to readers as his negative criticism of traditional values. (The disparity is often marked in literature by doubts as to whether Nietzsche has a “positive” ethic to offer.) There is something in this reaction: Nietzsche's criticism has a clear goal and develops on an extended scale, while his suggestions about alternative values may seem scattered or telegraphic. That said, it is not as if Nietzsche is the least shy about making valuedly charged claims, including the “positive ones.” To a certain extent, disappointment among commentators in search of “positive views” arises from our search for the wrong things, for example, seeking a systematically organized axiological theory when Nietzsche himself is skeptical of any such project, or waiting for any “positive” ethics to accommodate certain “moral intuitions” that Nietzsche is more inclined to challenge than to save. This section examines some territories that Nietzsche covers under the heading “Creation of value”. After mentioning different options to understand the nature of such “creation,” explore some of the values it promotes.",C2

In Strawson's interpretation, for example, ""the fact that my experience is of a unified objective world is a necessary consequence of the fact that only under this condition could I be aware of my diverse experiences as one and all of mine"" (1966: 94). Some interpreters disagree; Karl Ameriks, for example, argues that Strawson's conception of the Deduction is motivated by the desire to see it as a sign that the skeptic of the outside world is wrong, while, in fact, refuting this type of skeptic is not one of Kant's objectives for this argument (Ameriks 1978; also Allais 2011, 2015). Patricia Kitcher (2011: 115–18) argues against the unique premise on the interpretation of self-consciousness on historical and textual bases.
An incontrovertible role of §17 is to provide a characterization of an object, or more to the point, of a representation of an object, which facilitates a challenge to associationism by smoking. Kant's proposal is that an object is ""in whose concept a multiplicity of a certain intuition unites"" (B137). Here the ""object"" should be read in the broad sense of the objective characteristic of reality, a characteristic whose existence and nature are independent of how it is perceived (B 142; Bird 1962/1973 130-31; Strawson 1966: 98–104; Guyer 1987: 11–24). Allison is an advocate of the view that §17 contains not only this challenge to Hume, but also an attempt to demonstrate that we represent objects on the basis of the conclusions on self-awareness set out in §16. This interpretation is a component of Allison's broader view of Deduction-B, according to which Kant demonstrates that the unity of perception implies that we represent objects, and, conversely, that our representative objects imply the necessary unity of perception (Allison 1983: 144ff; 2015: 352-55). In fact, the crucial assertion for Allison's interpretation is that the unity of perception is not only a necessary condition but also sufficient for our representation of objects. This is called the reciprocity thesis. Other commentators, including Richard Aquila (1989: 159), Howell (1992: 227-8) and Schulting (2012a) agree that Deduction-B presents the thesis of reciprocity and an attempt to establish its truth, while Ameriks (1978) disagrees. Because of the kind of favors of Ameriks, the unity of perception, and more precisely, the synthesis that explains our consciousness of the identity of the subject, is only a necessary condition for the representation of objects (cf. Allais 2011).
Allison's interpretation is particularly attractive because it promises influence against the skeptic who denies that we represent objects, and also because this influence is generated by premises about the self-consciousness that this skeptic is likely to accept. However, there are textual and charitable reasons to resist this reading (Ameriks 1978, Pereboom 1995; Patricia Kitcher 2011: 115–60; Vinci 2014: 193–94). First, in 18–20 Kant makes significant assumptions about the characteristics of our representations of objects that exceed anything he has defended in §17 or earlier. In particular, §18 assumes that our representations of objects manifest a certain type of necessity and universality, and this is not intended to establish in §17 or earlier. On the other hand, the summary of the previous steps of Deduction B in §20 Kant does not include the premises of 15-16. What we actually find in §20 indicates that Kant intends, with some help from §13, to constitute a unique and autonomous argument that does not depend on the conclusions on self-awareness developed in §15-16.",C2
"The Three Friends -- or, as they are more formally known, the leaders of the United States, Canada and Mexico -- announced on Wednesday an agreement to work on a plan to streamline trade and travel, including border controls between countries.
US President Barack Obama, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto agreed to simplify border controls to facilitate the movement of people through the establishment of a trusted traveler program.
They also spent a lot of time during the American Leaders Summit discussing efforts to negotiate a new trade agreement with Pacific nations, they said at a joint press conference after the summit in Toluca, Mexico.
Obama has called on the Congressional commercial authority to accelerate the search for the so-called Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive free trade zone.
But members of their own party, including House minority leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate majority leader Harry Reid, have expressed strong opposition to such authority.
Republicans took advantage of Vice President Joe Biden's remarks at last week's Democratic retreat in Maryland. There, it was heard that the granting of the trade issue was rapidly becoming a source of frustration within the party, especially among the working groups that are key to the mid-term reviews next fall.
The jobs they care about most are the Democrats in Congress, not the families across the country willing to join the ranks of the employees, said Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell in a statement.
Senior Obama administration officials denied reports of Biden's comments as coming from second-hand accounts. But, they added, the White House remains firmly committed to its business agenda.
One official said it would not be in the interest of the United States to put this in the background.
White House spokesman Jay Carney insists that differences between Democrats on trade issues go back to several administrations.
The different opinions on these issues are not new, and the fact that there are different opinions within both sides is not new, Carney said on Tuesday.
Another area of friendly disagreement for the Three Friends is the Obama administration's handling of the Keystone XL pipeline.
Canadian officials have been impatient with the long process of approval in the United States for the contested project, which would transport oil from Alberta to the Gulf of Mexico.
While a recent State Department environmental impact study seemed to welcome the prospects for approval, senior management officials indicated that Harper is unlikely to receive the news that many in his nation want to hear during the summit.
I think what President Obama will do is explain where we are in the Keystone pipeline review, and indicate that, of course, we will let our Canadian friends know when we have reached a decision, said a senior administration official.
The Keystone project has also divided the Democrats, that is, the environmentalists who see the pipeline as a symbolic battle in the biggest struggle for efforts to address climate change.
While in Mexico, Obama faced another delicate act of balance on the issue of immigration reform.
The plight of undocumented immigrants in the United States, in particular the considerable number of migrants who crossed the border from Mexico, is a major political problem south of the Rio Grande.
Latino special interest groups, a central district of the Democratic Party, have criticized the administration for its aggressive deportation policy as it struggles to find a long-term solution to the immigration problem.
Senior administration officials told journalists last week that Obama remains committed to comprehensive immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship for undocumented workers.
But that legislative priority has reached a blockade in Congress, where Republican leaders have indicated that there is little hope for a breakthrough this year before the partial exams.
Regarding immigration, I think President Peña Nieto has a very good understanding, frankly, of the state of play in the United States, said a senior administration official.

"The shares of GameStop and other companies caught in the recent social media-driven commercial frenzy bounced off Friday, after the online runner Robinhood lifted all the tax purchase curbs at the top of the battle between amateur investors and Wall Street hedge funds.
The video game retailer, the initial trigger for the slugfest market after gaining popularity on the social media platform of Reddit WallStreetBets, closed 19.20% at $63.77 after hitting a maximum session of $95, although the wild spins seen in the last two weeks seemed to be relaxing.
“The influence of WallStreetBets is decreasing to some extent because there are many people who burned,” said Dennis Dick, head of the market structure and owner of Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas.
“From a short salesman’s point of view, a week and a half ago I got scared to cut any small hat because I was worried that WallStreetBets could squeeze me in it,” Dick said. “I’m not scared anymore; I kind of went back to normal trade, so I can say that WallStreetBets’ influence isn’t as strong as it was last week.”
Robinhood, among the commission-free online brokers accredited to fuel operations, said by the end of Thursday he had removed all purchase restrictions imposed due to an increase in the deposit requirements of the clearing house last week.
With many of the shares involved in the so-called “Rally of Reddit” collapsing this week, hedge funds with bottom positions at GameStop earned $3.6 billion in profits compared to $12.5 billion losses in January, Ortex’s financial analysis firm said on Friday.
The fall of the fall is reduced in what goes this year for GameStop shorts to $8.73 billion in realized and unrealized losses until Friday morning, according to the S3 Partners analysis firm.

Analysts noted an impressive debut in Hong Kong for Kuaishou Technology, backed by Tencent, as more evidence of the growing power of small investors, but at the WallStreetBets forum at the heart of last week's action there were few signs of consensus around new stock market favorites.
“The speculation is fading now, but that doesn’t mean I can’t come back within a month or two months,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.
“Many small investors may have burned, so it will take time to heal that wound,” Cardillo said. “It may not appear in the actions that have already been attacked, but it could happen in other companies and perhaps on a wider scale.”
Other actions that have seen sharp declines as their fortunes are invested in the social media phenomenon, such as Koss Corp and Blackberry's shares on the U.S. list closed higher on Friday, while others like Bed, Bath & Beyond saw their price fall slowly.
Janet Yellen, U.S. Treasury Secretary, met with senior officials on Thursday to discuss volatility, and sources told Reuters that securities regulators were examining all aspects of the rally and all parties involved.
GameStop shares have fallen to just $51.09 after climbing to $483 last week, but it continues to rise by about 22% from the levels at the start of the rally in mid-January. The AMC Entertainment film operator's shares have been reduced by more than half since a closing peak of $19.90 and closed 3.67% on Friday.
The shares of the insurance company Clover Health, which on Thursday became the first company to be targeted for a short sales report in weeks, increased by 5.7% due to a late rally provoked by comments by risk capitalist sponsor Chamath Palihapitiya in response. The company said earlier on Friday that it had received a letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission after the report published by Hindenburg Research.
Meanwhile, at WallStreetBets, participants continued to urge investors to continue with GameStop.

"Context. Water is a key molecule in the physics and chemistry of the formation of stars and planets, but it is difficult to observe from Earth. The Herschel
The Space Observatory provides unprecedented sensitivity and spatial and spectral resolution to study water. Water in star-forming regions
with Herschel (WISH) key program was designed to observe water in a wide range of environments and provide a legacy data set to address your
physics and chemistry.
Notes. The objective of WISH is to determine which physical components are tracked by the gaseous phase water lines observed with Herschel and quantify
conditions of arousal and abundance of water in each of these components. This then provides a vision of how and where most of the water
forms in space and how it is transported from clouds to disks, and ultimately comets and planets.
Methods. The data and results of WISH are summarized together with those of the related leisure programs. WISH focused on 80 sources throughout the
the two axes of luminosity and evolutionary phase: of low to high mass protostars (luminosities of <1 to > 105 L) and of prestellar
cores to protoplanetary disks. H2O lines and their isotopologues, HDO, OH, CO and [O I] were observed with the HIFI and PACS instruments,
complemented by other chemically related molecules that are probes of ultraviolet chemistry, X-ray or grain. The analysis consists of the coupling
the physical structure of sources with simple chemical networks and using non-LTE radiative transfer calculations to directly compare models;
and observations.
Results. Most of the distant infrared water emission observed with Herschel in star-forming regions originates from a hot and shocked flow of water
gas at high density and temperature (> 105)

, 300–1000 K, v + 25 km s−1

single-platter CO lines under J, but only by CO lines with Jup > 14. The emission is compact, with at least two different types of speed components
I've seen it. Water is a significant but not dominant refrigerant of hot gas in the early protostellar stages. The abundance of hot gas water is universal
low: orders of magnitude below H2O/H2 abundance of 4 × 10−4
is expected if all volatile oxygen is blocked in the water. In cold prestellar cores and
outer protostellar envelopes, the structure of water abundance is probed uniquely on scales much smaller than the beam through the determined speed
Line profiles. Inferred abundance of gaseous water decreases with depth in the cloud with an improved layer at the edge due to photo-desorption
water ice. All these conclusions remain independent of protostellar luminosity. For low mass protostars, a constant ratio of HDO/H2O gas to

high mass sources. The water vapour emission of young and mature discs is weak.
Conclusions. The main chemical pathways of water have been identified and quantified at each stage of stellar formation. Low warm water
The abundances can be explained by shock models that include UV radiation to dissociate the water and modify the shock structure. UV fields above
a 102 − 103
times the general interstellar radiation field is inferiated into the walls of the exit cavity on the Herschel beam scales of several
hydrides. Both high-temperature chemistry and ice sputtering contribute to the abundance of gaseous water at low speeds, with only gas phase (re-
)formation that produces water at high speeds. Combined water gas and ice analyses show that up to 50% of the oxygen budget may be missing.
In cold clouds, an elegant solution is that this seemingly missing oxygen is enclosed in larger μm grains that do not contribute to infrared
absorption of ice. The fact that even hot exits and hot cores do not show H2O at full oxygen abundance points to an unidentified refractory
component, which is also found in diffuse clouds. The weak water vapour emission from the discs indicates that the water ice is enclosed in larger pebbles
early in the embedded Class I stage and that these pebbles have settled and drifted inwards by the Class II stage. Water is transported from the clouds
to disks mostly like ice, with no evidence of strong accretion shocks. Even in abundances that are somewhat lower than expected, many oceans
water is likely to be present in the regions that make up the planet. Based on lessons for galactic protostars, the emission of the low line H2O J (Eup < 300 K)
observed in extragalactic sources it is inferred that they are predominantly excited by collision and originate mainly in compact regions of the current star
training activity. Recommendations are made for future mid- or far-away infrared missions.",C2
"According to Kant, what is unique about the motivation for duty is that it consists of pure respect for moral law. What naturally comes to mind is this: Duties are rules or laws of some kind combined with some kind of restriction or incentive felt in our choices, whether from external coercion by others or from our own powers of reason. For example, the statutes of a club set out the duties of its officers and impose them with sanctions. Municipal and state laws establish the duties of citizens and enforce them with coercive legal power. Therefore, if we do something because it is our “civic” duty, or our “boy scout” or “good American” duty, our motivation is respect for the code that does our duty. To think that we are obliged to do our duty is simply to respect, as such, certain laws that belong to us.
As intuitive as it is, this cannot be all Kant's meaning. First of all, as with the Jim Crow laws of the ancient South and the Nuremberg laws of Nazi Germany, the laws to which this type of “duty actions” conform can be morally despicable. Respect for those laws could hardly be considered valuable. For another, our motive for conforming our actions to civic and other laws is rarely unconditional respect. We also have an eye to do our part in maintaining civil or social order, in punishing or losing prestige and reputation in violating such laws, and other results of legal behavior. In fact, we respect these laws to the extent, but only to the extent, that they do not violate values, laws or principles that we have more expensive. However, Kant thinks that, in acting from duty, we are not at all motivated by a prospective result or some other extrinsic characteristic of our conduct, except to the extent that these are requirements of duty itself. We are motivated by the mere conformity of our will to the law as such.
Acting out of respect for moral law, in Kant's opinion, is being moved to act by the recognition that moral law is a supremely authoritative norm that unites us and to experience a kind of feeling, which is similar to fear and fear, when we recognize moral law as the source of moral requirements. Humans inevitably have respect for moral law although it does not always move us and although we do not always comply with the moral norms that we recognize as authoritarian.
Kant's account of the content of moral requirements and the nature of moral reasoning is based on his analysis of the unique force that moral considerations have as reasons to act. The strength of moral requirements as reasons is that we cannot ignore them no matter how circumstances might conspire against any other consideration. The basic moral requirements retain their motivational force under any circumstances, have universal validity. Therefore, anything else that can be said about basic moral requirements, its content is universal. Only a universal law could be the content of a requirement that has the force of right morality. This leads Kant to a preliminary formulation of the IQ: “I should never act but in such a way that I too could want my maxim to become universal law” (G 4:402). This is the principle that motivates good will, and that Kant regards as the fundamental principle of all morality.

"Hyundai Motor Co of South Korea said on Monday that it is not now in talks with Apple Inc in autonomous electric cars, just a month after it confirmed the initial talks with the technology giant, sending the automaker's shares slip.
Slideshow ( 3 images )
Eliminating $2.1 billion from its market value, Hyundai's shares plummeted by 4.2% before 0330 GMT. Shares in its subsidiary Kia Corp, which had been tipped in local media reports as Apple's likely operating partner, fell 12% - a $4.3 billion hit.
The announcement puts the curtain in weeks of internal divisions within Hyundai Motor Co Group - father of both car manufacturers - on the potential tie, with some executives raising concerns about becoming a contract maker for the US tech giant.
“We are receiving requests for cooperation in the joint development of autonomous electric vehicles from several companies, but they are at an early stage and nothing has been decided,” said car manufacturers on Monday, in compliance with securities market rules that require regular updates to investors in relation to market rumors.
“We are not having discussions with Apple about the development of autonomous vehicles.”
Kia's shares had jumped 61% after Hyundai seemed to confirm a local media report in early January that Apple and Hyundai were in discussions to develop electric motor vehicles by 2027 and develop batteries in U.S. factories operated by Hyundai or Kia.
“Apple and Hyundai are under discussion, but as it is in the initial stage, nothing has been decided,” said Hyundai, before publishing subsequent statements that removed all Apple mentions, but said Hyundai was receiving requests for cooperation from electric cars from parties that it did not identify.
Reuters reported in December that Apple was moving forward with autonomous automotive technology and was aiming to produce a passenger vehicle that could include its own advanced battery technology as early as 2024.
Apple, known for keeping product plans under tight bandages, has never recognized discussions with the car manufacturer about vehicle construction, and was not immediately available for comments outside business hours in the United States.
Analysts said the talks could have collapsed due to leaks from the media partnership plan, or due to Apple's possible insistence that Hyundai's role in any tie would be that of a team manufacturer, rather than a strategic partner.
“With numerous news reports on discussions between the two companies, which should have concluded confidentiality agreements, it would have been uncomfortable,” said Kwon Soon-woo, an analyst at SK Securities.
Kevin Yoo, an analyst at eBEST Investment & Securities, said: “It seems clear that Hyundai Motor Group has not been too happy to deal with Apple... They made it clear that they don’t want to be treated as Apple’s supplier or manufacturer.”",C2
"In houses and cafes all over the country, a cup of tea, baked beans in toast and fish and chips have played a key role in the British gastronomic experience. However, the scope of a change of taste over generations has been captured in a recent data set published in the National Food Survey, which was created in 1940 by the government after concerns about health and access to food.
Despite the apparent British love of tea, consumption has declined by more than half since the 1970s, from 68g of tea per person per week to only 25g. With a bag of tea or loose tea weighing about 3g, that means the British are drinking on average only eight cups of tea a week today, starting from 23 cups in 1974. And while tea is still the drunkest hot drink in the UK, households spend more on coffee.
The data, published by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs as part of its “open data” plan, are for 150,000 households that participated in the survey between 1974 and 2000, combined with information from 2000 to 2014. It shows some movements towards healthier diets in recent decades, with changes to low-calorie soft drinks, from whole milk to skimmed milk and increasing consumption of fresh fruit. But, the weekly consumption of chips, pizza, chips and ready meals has skyrocketed.
There has also been a dramatic shift from white to brown, whole flour and other bread, but figures suggest that the amount people are eating has fallen from 25 to 15 slices a week in the last four decades, based on a slice of 40g of a medium sliced bread. The consumption of beans baked in salsa has decreased by a fifth despite an increase in other types of food of convenience, particularly Italian dishes. Adults in the UK now eat an average of 75g of pizza each week, compared to none in 1974, while pasta consumption has nearly tripled over the same period.
Fresh potatoes are also becoming less essential, with a 67% decrease since 1974, when adults ate the equivalent of 188g a day. Other vegetables such as cucumbers, zucchini, eggplants and mushrooms have gained space on the table. The consumption of carry-on food has almost doubled since 1974, from 80g per person per week to 150g. About 33g of this amount is fries and 56g is meat, with kebabs (10g), chicken (7g), hamburgers (5g) and “meat-based foods” (32g) particularly popular.
Some trends suggest that the British are becoming more prudent in what they put in their dishes, with the average consumption of fruits, both fresh and processed, increasing by 50% since 1974. In 2014, UK adults ate an average of 157g of fruit per day, equivalent to nearly two portions of the government's five-day recommendation. Bananas have been the most popular fruit in the UK since 1996, reaching 221g per adult per week in 2014, well above apples (131g) and oranges (48g). Low-calorie soft drinks accounted for half of all soft drinks consumed in 2014 for the first time.
Other social changes arise from the survey, with questions about the possession of chickens and getting their own eggs to fall in 1991 and a somewhat late end in the same year to ask the “housewife” to fill out the questionnaire. The British are spending a lower proportion of the pay on food today – 11%, compared to 24% in 1974.
Elizabeth Truss, United Kingdom Environment Secretary, said: “Food is the heart and soul of our society and this data shows not only what we were eating 40 years ago, but how a change in culture has led to a food revolution. Buyers are more connected to where their food comes from than ever before, the Internet has brought quality products to our doors with the click of a button, pop-up restaurants are showing the latest trends and exciting global cuisines are now as common as fish and chips.”
“By opening this data, we can look beyond what, where or how previous generations were eating and point out the moments that changed our habits forever. We have only scratched the surface of what the National Food Survey can tell us and, from local food maps and school projects to the prediction of new food trends, I hope to see how this data can be used to learn more about our past and grow our world’s leading food and agricultural industry in the future.”",C2
"The health warnings covering almost two thirds of cigarette packages and the ban on menthol cigarettes across the EU have come a little closer after a vote in the European Parliament. On the other hand, Parliament considers that most e-cigarettes, which are increasingly popular as alternatives to tobacco products, do not need to be regulated in the same way as medicines.
Health officials and the e-cigarette industry in Britain are trying to clarify what this means, for example, if rapidly expanding market companies face the same sponsorship and promotion bans at sporting events as tobacco companies.
The Department of Health shall not comment on the issue of publicity until officials have studied the decisions of Members of the European Parliament. But, in a statement, the DH said: “We are very happy to see the progress towards tougher action on tobacco, with controls at European level banning aromatized cigarettes and the introduction of stricter rules on pre-package health warnings. “However, we are disappointed by the decision to reject the proposal to regulate nicotine-containing products, including e-cigarettes, as medicines. We believe that these products should be regulated as medicines and we will continue to raise this point during further negotiations.
“The figures show that smoking levels in England are the lowest since registration began – 19.5% – but we are determined to further reduce smoking rates and believe this important step will help.”
The British e-cigarette industry, which welcomed Parliament’s vote, said it was already in discussions with the Advertising Standards Authority, but added that it would not be “sensitive, proportionate, reasonable or useful” to ban any advertising.
MEPs decided that e-cigarettes should only be regulated as medical products if manufacturers claimed that they could prevent smoking, a decision criticized by the government's main drug regulator.
They want to put the products, used by an estimated 1.3 million people in Britain by 2014, on the same legal basis as gums, patches and mouth sprays intended to help smokers quit smoking, but industry says the costly licensing process would help force tobacco alternatives from shelves.
MEPs voted in favour of putting health warnings on 65% of each pack of cigarettes, instead of 75% proposed. At present, warnings cover at least 30 per cent at the front and 40 per cent at the back. The United Kingdom Government has delayed the decision to follow Australia through the introduction of standard packaging until there is evidence that such measures reduce tobacco consumption.
The votes of Members of the European Parliament at the first reading of the draft tobacco directive, which could become law in 2014, will be followed by negotiations with the EU Council of Ministers.
The Regulatory Authority for Medicines and Health Products had already invited manufacturers to cooperate by opting for voluntary regulation in June 2013 ahead of what it still expects to be mandatory across Europe. “The legislative process has not yet been completed and there will be new negotiations. The UK continues to believe that the medical regulation of CPNs is the best way to offer a benefit to public health,” said a spokesperson.
Linda McAvan, Yorkshire Labour MEP and Humber and spokesperson for the Socialists and Democrats Group in Parliament on tobacco, said: “We know that it is children, not adults, who start smoking. And, despite the downward trend in most Member States of adult smokers, World Health Organisation figures show worrying upward trends in some of our Member States of young smokers.
“We need to stop tobacco companies targeting young people with a variety of gymmicky products and we need to make sure that cigarette packs contain effective warnings.”
Martin Callanan, the Conservative MEP for northeastern England, said: “It would have been madness to force e-cigs to leave the shelves. These are products that have helped countless people stop smoking more harmful cigarettes and yet some MEPs wanted them to be more difficult to make than ordinary tobacco.""
Katherine Devlin, president of ECITA, the e-cigarette industry association, said that “the really important decision” of MEPs not to support the regulation of medicines meant that that was already out of the question.
Parliament also called on the Commission to draw up an action plan for the protection of consumers against the risks posed by tobacco consumption in the internal market.

"An important international line with broad implications for global drug policy has erupted over the right of indigenous Indian tribes in Bolivia to chew coca leaves, the main ingredient of cocaine. Bolivia had obtained a special exemption from the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961, a framework governing international drug policy, allowing its indigenous peoples to chew on leaves.
Bolivia had argued that the Convention opposed its new Constitution, adopted in 2009, which obliges it to ""protect native and ancestral coca as cultural heritage"" and maintains that coca ""in its natural state...is not a narcotic.""
South American Indians have chewed coca leaves for centuries. The leaves supposedly provide energy and are said to have medicinal qualities. Supporters of Bolivia's position praised her for defending the rights of indigenous peoples. “The Bolivian movement is inspiring and innovative,” said Danny Kushlick, Head of Foreign Affairs of the Drug Policy Transformation Foundation, which promotes drug liberalization. “It shows that any country that has had enough of the war on drugs can change the terms of its commitment to UN conventions.”
However, the UN International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), which oversees the implementation of the world drug treaties, has accused Bolivia of threatening the integrity of the international drug control regime. Several countries – including the United Kingdom, the United States, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands and Russia – opposed the demands of Bolivia.
The UK’s submission to the UN, which oversees the convention, said that it “recognizes and respects the cultural importance of coca leaf in Bolivia,” but adds: “The UK is... concerned that the reserve can lead to increases in coca production and – crucially – the amount of coca diverted to the cocaine trade. As such, the reservation would weaken international law in terms of the global effort to deal with the drug trade and could weaken the international community’s response to that trade.”
The right of indigenous communities in the Andean region of South America to chew coca leaf was eliminated in 1964 when Bolivia was under a dictatorship and acceded to the convention. But, under the terms of the agreement, Bolivia received 25 years to implement the ban. This expired in 1989 and since then the issue has been the subject of controversy.
In 2011, Bolivia – whose president, Evo Morales, is a former coca producer – formally notified the UN of its withdrawal from the convention. On Friday he joined the convention again, but with an exemption from the ban on chewing coca leaves.
This measure is the first of its kind in the history of the United Nations drug control treaties and has raised concerns that other countries may request amendments. The Russian government has argued that the bill will lead to “an increase in the illegal circulation of cocaine” and warned that it “also sets a dangerous precedent that could be used by other states to create a more liberal drug control regime.”
The Select Committee on Internal Affairs of the British Parliament has recommended that Bolivia's request be supported by the UK government, arguing that it was important for countries to remain within the single convention. Bolivia's re-accession could only be blocked if one third or more of the 184 countries that had acceded to the Convention objected to its request. There are suspicions that the United States and the United Kingdom are frantically pushing other countries to get enough numbers to block Bolivia's petition.
Nancie Prud’homme, Project Director of the International Centre for Human Rights and Drug Policy, criticized the coordinated opposition to Bolivia’s demands. “These objections are legally questionable,” he said. They supported an arbitrary and excessively broad provision and applied international drug laws in a vacuum. This is not appropriate. No State has paid attention to decades of development of international norms on cultural and indigenous rights, which support Bolivia’s efforts.”
The decision to ban coca chewing was based on a 1950 report by the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Coca Leaf, which, according to advocates of drug liberalization, was not based on supporting evidence. In an interview in 1949, Commission chief Howard B Fonda noted his opposition to coca leaf chewing before he began his investigation. Fonda told an interviewer: “We believe that the daily and inveterated use of coca leaves chewing...not only is it completely harmful and therefore harmful, but it is also the cause of racial degeneration in many population centers, and of the decline that manifests visibly in many Indians... Our studies will confirm the certainty of our claims and we hope to be able to present a rational plan of action... to achieve the absolute and safe abolition of this pernicious habit.”
Coca leaf cultivation is legal and licensed in Bolivia. The policy has been credited with a fall in cocaine production in the country, which has led some experts to see the Bolivian model as a way forward for other countries.

"Spain is expelling the Libyan ambassador to Madrid and three other Libyan diplomats here, the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Thursday.
The government of Spain has decided to put an end to the mission of the ambassador accredited to Madrid by the authorities of Tripoli-LRB-Libya-RRB, because the Gaddafi regime has lost all legitimacy due to its continued repression against the Libyan population, the statement said.
Libyan ambassador to Madrid, Ajeli Abdussalam Ali Breni, has 10 days to leave Spain, the ministry said.
The government is also expelling three other diplomats at the Libyan embassy who engaged in activities incompatible with their diplomatic status, the statement said.
But Spain has not broken diplomatic relations with Libya, said a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is not usually identified.
Spain still has an embassy in Tripoli, although it evacuated its personnel from the city, like many other nations, while fighting between the Moammar Gaddafi regime and the rebels intensified at the end of March.
The Spanish Embassy in Tripoli, composed solely of local Libyan personnel, is not closed in a diplomatic sense, the spokesman said.
He added that it was not clear immediately how many Libyan diplomats or local Spanish staff could remain at the Libyan Embassy in Madrid, following the expulsion of the ambassador and the three other Libyan diplomats.
On 8 June, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Spain, Trinidad Jiménez, visited the Libyan rebel stronghold of Benghazi, where it declared that the rebel National Transitional Council of Libya was a valid interlocutor and a legitimate representative of the aspirations of the Libyan people, the spokesman said.
Spain has participated in United Nations-led NATO-led military operations in Libya. Spain has deployed four F-18 fighter aircraft and one refuelling aircraft to help enforce a no-fly zone, and a frigate, submarine and surveillance aircraft to help enforce an arms embargo against the Gaddafi regime.

"Supreme Court Judge Sonia Sotomayor was put at the centre of national attention on two hot topics this week.
It has nothing to do with the cases involved: same-sex marriage in Utah and the requirement for birth control coverage under Obamacare.
The two emergency appeals on New Year ' s Eve came because the cases originated in the western parts of the country -- Colorado and Utah -- which are under their jurisdiction for reviewing time-sensitive federal motions.
Sotomayor looked for more information about a Utah appeal to keep its voter-approved ban on same-sex unions in the state.
But she made headlines on the case with political positions around the Affordable Care Act just as the new rules were about to come into effect.
Sotomayor issued an order that, for the time being, was maintained as a requirement under the comprehensive health law for certain affiliated religious groups to ensure that employees receive contraceptive coverage at no cost.
The Denver-based organization dealing with the poor elderly, the Little Sisters of the Poor, is opposed to complying with the rules of the law that would guarantee an exemption, but, in theory, still require a third party to provide contraceptive insurance.
Ultimately, he believes that authorizing a form that passes the ball to another entity still means contraceptive coverage for its employees and that, for nuns, it is objectionable for moral reasons. The Catholic Church opposes artificial contraception.
While Sotomayor's emergency order or any follow-up to extend it or seek the opinion of his fellow judges for further review may seem like a blow to the health law with political charges, it is not.
Nor does it give any meaning to the position of Sotomayor, a liberal jurist, on the broader issues raised in the appeal in general.
He just put a single case on hold. She didn't dump Obamacare, CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said.
His decision at the end of Tuesday simply curbed the fulfillment of the Little Sisters of the Poor and allowed the Obama administration to present its arguments.
The Department of Justice said Friday that the appeal was without merit. The charity, he said, is eligible for an exemption and in addition, the entity that administers its insurance plans, the non-profit Christian Brothers Services, is also exempt under certain conditions in the Obamacare rules applicable to religious institutions.
Toobin said Sotomayor acted based on his view of the law by upholding the rule in this case.
Sotomayor voted for the Affordable Care Act in 2012 in a Supreme Court ruling that gave Obama a huge political victory.
Obamacare seeks to extend health coverage to millions of Americans without it and is the national achievement of the President's signature. It is being relentlessly attacked by conservatives who have made numerous attempts to revoke or otherwise sink it, and it is the focus of numerous legal challenges.

"Loneliness has finally become a hot topic – the National Bureau of Statistics has found Britain to be the most lonely country in Europe. The British are less likely to have strong friends or meet their neighbours than residents elsewhere in the EU, and a relatively high proportion of them have no one to trust in a crisis. Meanwhile, Professor John Cacioppo's research at the University of Chicago has found that loneliness is twice as bad for the health of older people as obesity and almost as great a cause of death as poverty.
But, however shocking this may be, such studies overlook the epidemic of loneliness among younger adults. In 2010, the Mental Health Foundation considered loneliness to be a greater concern among young people than among the elderly. Young people aged 18 to 34 surveyed were more likely to feel alone often, to worry about being lonely, and to feel depressed because of loneliness than those over 55.
“Loneliness is a recognized problem among the elderly – there are day centers and charities to help them,” says Sam Challis, information manager at Mind’s mental health charity, “but when young people reach 21, they are too old for youth services.” This is problematic due to the close relationship between loneliness and mental health – it is related to increased stress, depression, paranoia, anxiety, addiction, cognitive impairment and is a known factor in suicide. In a new essay, Paul Farmer, the executive director of Mind, and Jenny Edwards, the executive director of the Mental Health Foundation, say it can be both a cause and an effect of mental health problems.
But what can young people do to fight loneliness? Dr. Grant Blank, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute, points out that social media and the Internet can be both a blessing and a problem. They are beneficial when they allow us to communicate with distant loved ones, but not when they replace face-to-face contact. “People present an idealized version of themselves online and hope to have social lives like those presented in the media,” says Challis. Comparing the seemingly perfect life of friends with ours can lead us to retreat socially.
Although meditation techniques and applications such as Headspace are fashionable solutions that are frequently recommended for a number of mental health problems, they are not necessarily helpful for loneliness, as they actively encourage us to live alone in our thoughts. “It would be better if you first addressed the underlying causes of being alone – what is stopping you from going out and seeing people?” asks Challis.
In fact, a social media study at the University of Michigan in 2013 found that while Facebook reduces life satisfaction, the use of technology to help you meet new people can be beneficial. And, if for any reason, you are unable to venture outside, the Internet can bring comfort. Mumsnet has been “an absolute blessing” to Maddy Matthews, 19, a student with a two-month-old daughter. From birth, he rarely sees his college friends and his partner works most nights. “In the early days, I was awake until late at night feeding him and worried that he was doing something wrong. Being able to publish on Mumsnet has helped me feel less alone.”
Helplines can also reduce loneliness, at least in the short term. One in four men who call charity emotional support Samaritans mention loneliness or isolation and connect is a free confidential helpline for young people, where they can seek help with emotional and mental health problems often related to loneliness. There are also support services on websites like Mind’s that can remind you that you’re not alone.
At work, it may be beneficial to tell your employer how you feel. John Binns, who advises companies on mental health and well-being, was admitted to the hospital for stress-related depression in 2007 and took two months of work. It felt like there was no one to talk to and he wasn't close enough to his colleagues to notice the changes in their behavior. Greater openness with his employer and colleagues made his return to work easier. “People often find that colleagues are more supportive than they expected. Mine began to reach out, asking me to have lunch and making sure that the world had not advanced so much since I left.”
Office chit-chat may seem like a waste of time, but it helps protect us from the emotional and psychological effects of work stress. “If you form connections with your team, you can be stressed but not isolated,” says Rick Hughes,
The British Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) is the leading advisor for the workplace.
“We treat the networks we have as incidentals, but they are fundamental to our well-being,” says Nicky Forsythe, a psychotherapist and founder of Talk for Health, a social enterprise that empowers people to give and receive peer support in groups. “The most important thing is to have a regular time and place to reflect on your life and have an empathetic listener.”
To develop personal skills such as empathy, counseling can help. The BACP website allows you to search for counselors in your area. “A problem transmitted is a shared problem and sometimes you need to talk to someone impartial and independent of your friends and family,” Hughes says. Most universities offer students such advice and many organize group sessions that specifically address loneliness.
If it is believed that recent research, loneliness is killing the elderly and, with an ageing population, we should try to reduce our isolation before it is too late. “Aging doesn’t have to mean being alone anymore,” says Ruth Sutherland, executive director of the Relate relationship advisory service, in a new report. “But much of this rests on laying the foundations for good quality relationships earlier in life.”",C2
"Before we proceed to the evaluation of ontological arguments, we need to clarify what the correct objectives of ontological arguments may be. Suppose we think the arguments have defenders and objectives: when a defender presents an argument to an objective, the defender's goal is to achieve some change in the objective. What could be the objectives of the ontological arguments, and what could be the changes that the advocates of these arguments intend to achieve in these objectives?
Here are some proposals; no doubt the reader can think of others:
The targets could be atheists, and the goal could be to turn them into theists.
The objectives could be agnostic, and the goal could be to turn them into theistic.
The objectives could be theistic, and the goal could be to improve the doxastic position of the Theists.
The objectives could be professional philosophers, and the aim could be to advance the understanding of the consequences of adopting particular logical rules, or to treat existence as a real predicate, or to allow definitions to have existential significance, or something similar.
The goals could be undergraduate philosophy students, and the goal might be to give them some frustrating enough examples in which to cut their critical teeth.
In the next discussion, the objectives are supposed to be atheists and agnostics, and the goal is to turn them into theists. Suppose a defender presents an ontological argument to an objective. What conditions should these arguments meet if they are appropriate for the intended purpose? One plausible suggestion is that, minimally, it should make the objectives recognize that they have good reason to accept the conclusion of the argument that they did not recognize that they had before the presentation of the argument. The adoption of this plausible suggestion provides the following criterion: a successful ontological argument is one that should make atheists and agnostics recognize that they have good reasons to believe that God exists that they did not recognize they have before the argument was presented. Note that this criterion has a normative dimension: it announces what atheists and agnostics should do when the argument is presented.
There is an important discussion as to whether we should assume that the objectives of the ontological arguments are atheistic and agnostic, and that the aim is to make them theistic. However, it is simply beyond the scope of this entry to continue that debate here.",C2
"Leaving aside epic moments of disaster films such as volcanoes, hurricanes and earthquakes, there are two key natural factors that can make a city vulnerable to gradual disintegration or even total disappearance: water and sand.
If climate change made the planet colder than hotter, we could add ice to the list, as nothing destroys a city like a billion-ton glacier that goes down a valley. The impact of a rare “tsunami of ice” in 2013 in the Canadian municipality of Ochre Beach was only a taster: an iceberg wall melted on Lake Dauphin was blown by the winds on the shore, splintering every house on its way.
But Ochre Beach was an anomaly. In other places, the melting of the planet's ice is making cities vulnerable by the less dramatic route of raising sea level. A century ago, Venice, one of the most beautiful and low-lying cities in the world, used to flood about ten times a year. Today, its lowest point, Piazza San Marco (only three feet above sea level) is flooded with water approximately 100 times a year.
But the rise in sea level is not entirely to blame. In many parts of the world, the land is also sinking – in the case of Venice, the compaction of the subsoil (due to the industrial exploitation of the surroundings) reduced the city by 20 cm between 1950 and 1970. Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam is also sinking by about 2 cm per year, but that is nothing compared to Jakarta, which is falling from 10 to 20 cm per year. Over the past three decades, the city has sunk about four metres, making its 40-year-old marine wall less and less effective. Unfortunately for the Indonesian capital, it has pumped so much groundwater to support its population that the land above is drying and compacting, thus creating a bowl. The rivers that used to flow through the city to the sea have had to be diverted because they cannot drain uphill.
Although there are many plans to save Venice – and Ho Chi Minh City and Jakarta are taking the problem seriously – the same cannot be said of Miami, where politicians refuse to admit that the city has a serious environmental problem.
Miami's difficulties are triple. The Florida complex is less than ten feet above sea level; an increasing number of tropical storms are flooding the city; and it is built on porous limestone, which is absorbing rising sea water. This water then fills the foundations of the city and bubbles through drains and pipes, forcing the sewage up and polluting its fresh water. There's every chance that Miami will one day become uninhabitable.
In Maldives, entire island populations are trying to leave their homes. The capital, Male, with a population of 153,379 and only four feet above sea level, has used Japanese investment to build a 10-foot sea wall at a cost of $63 million, but in the long term, only a stabilization of sea level rise will save it and the rest of the islands.
And it's not just the sea: rains also endanger cities around the world. Recently, a whole summer of rain fell on a morning in Detroit, overwhelming its obsolete sewage systems. Impoverished by the collapse of the U.S. car industry, the city is struggling to build a system to cope. Drinking water is also affected because Detroit is particularly vulnerable to water-borne pathogens.
In Africa, desertification is causing the Sahara to spread south at a rate of 30 miles per year, threatening settlements in northern Mauritania. Over the past 20 years, for example, the desert has grown by more than 260 acres around the Chinguetti shopping and religious centre, which has seen its population decrease from 20,000 in the mid-20th century to just a few thousand now. Trading has almost stopped when the sand accumulates in the streets.
Similarly, the Californian Rancho Mirage complex, near Palm Springs, may have to be abandoned in the next decade. This city is just one example of a problem caused not so much by global warming as by human over-expansion against finite resources. California's dream of cultivating the desert made sense while its total population remained around half a million (in 1870) – but, now, the state is home to 38 million people, who, among them, own 32 million vehicles and expect to be surrounded by lawns and golf courses.
The daily use of water in Rancho Mirage is more than 200 gallons per person, which is leading to a man-made drought. A 25% reduction in water consumption has been applied, but it is unlikely to stabilize the complex, which is surrounded by sand and dust. The long-term response in the California desert is likely to be the abandonment of some cities while consolidating the populations of others.
Human flight is the final test of a city's disintegration. Once we stop maintaining a city, nature takes over very quickly. The Hashima Island of Japan became a concrete city in 1887 to exploit the underwater coal reserves, but in 1974, with the supply of coal about to run out, the mine was closed and Hashima was abandoned. Now, the sea spray is causing its concrete walls to collapse.
Fire is a growing threat to urban settlements in America – in fact, forest fires cause the greatest damage after severe storms, with 800 major fire disasters declared there between 1953 and 2014. A recent report by the USDA Forest Service shows the growing number of urban localities that are particularly vulnerable to forest fires.
Similarly, in Australia, some of the tourist centres in Victoria and several suburbs in Melbourne have been placed on a list of the 52 most vulnerable forest fire sites in the state because long-term droughts are making trees highly combustible. A forest fire is unlikely to destroy an entire city, but a succession of fires could make it uninhabitable, and abandonment remains one of the most powerful causes of urban collapse.
Many cities are fighting a lost battle against the ravages of nature, but is it possible to identify the most vulnerable metropolis in the world? Natural events are notoriously difficult to predict, but Malé's prospects seem particularly bleak, as, although its new marine wall remains effective, the islands around the capital of Maldives will soon disappear. And if they disappear, so does Male's raison d'être.

"A man more interested than most in what President Barack Obama will have to say in his address to the nation on Wednesday night is the leader of Al Qaeda Ayman al-Zawahiri.
In his hiding place somewhere in Pakistan or Afghanistan, he will probably be waiting for the President to establish a plan to exterminate the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria – LRB-ISIS –RRB – a group that has overshadowed Al Qaeda and made al-Zawahiri seem virtually irrelevant.
Al-Zawahiri and the Al Qaeda core are trapped in battle with ISIS for the leadership of the global jihadist movement, offering very different visions and strategies. ISIS was expelled from Al Qaeda in February after rejecting al-Zawahiri's demand to restrict its activities to Iraq.
ISIS has captured the imagination of a new generation of jihadists, both from Arab and European states, with their ruthless pursuit of a Caliphate, their dramatic territorial conquests and their relentless propaganda machinery.
Their chilling brutality towards non-Muslims and Muslims who do not share their rigid interpretation of Islam echoes the behaviour of their predecessor, Al Qaeda, in Iraq, whose brutal attacks on Shiite Muslims and moderate Sunnis provoked the wrath of the late Al Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden.
In short, ISIS' journey through Iraq represents a serious organizational, strategic and ideological blow to al Qaeda, wrote analyst Barak Mendelsohn at Foreign Affairs in June.
So far, the leaders of Al Qaeda affiliates have remained loyal – LRB – if not enthusiastic – to al-Zawahiri. After the death of its leader Ahmad Abdi Godane last week, Al-Shabaab quickly reiterated its loyalty to the leader of Al Qaeda, and Nasir al Wuhayshi, No. 2, remains at the helm of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula - LRB-AQAP-RRB.
Prominent jihadist preachers such as Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi and Abu Qatada have condemned ISIS for diversion.
Call for a new generation of jihadists
But the younger generation of jihadists seems to be more impressed by action than by sermons. Al Qaeda's standing soldiers, coming from Yemen, Libya, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere, are reaching ISISstandard. For them, their leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi confronts the apostates and builds the Caliphate, while al-Zawahiri speaks.
It is impossible to know the scale of this exodus. But last week, a group calling itself The Supporters of the Islamic State in Yemen posted a video promising allegiance to al-Baghdadi, calling him the Muslim Caliph — the mujahid in the front row of attack on America.
Even AQAP, the most effective of the group's affiliates, has expressed solidarity with ISIS fighters, condemning what it calls the U.S. declaration of war against Muslims in Iraq, and calling on all Islamic groups to support their brothers by afflicting the U.S.
On the contrary, it has been a long time since Al Qaeda Central has carried out any major attacks. Four years ago, a strategy paper set out ideas for attacking targets such as cruises, dams and bridges, as well as aircraft. But far beyond the lone wolf attacks by distant Al Qaeda sympathizers, it has occurred since then.
In the past three years, the most significant terrorist attacks against Western interests have been against the U.S. consulate compound in Benghazi, Libya, where there may have been some involvement of members of Al Qaeda affiliates; the gas plant in southern Algeria in January 2013, carried out by a malevolent group that pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda but did not appear to have acted according to its instructions; and the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya -- Al-Shabaab's work, apparently planned without reference to Al Qaeda leaders, even if it was exactly the type of operation that al-Zawahiri had called for.
Attacks on U.S. military, diplomatic and government targets in Afghanistan have largely been carried out by the Taliban and the Haqqani Network, although Al Qaeda fighters are entangled with these groups.
Some Al Qaeda affiliates have been forced to the defensive in the last two years. The French intervention in Mali pushed back the groups linked to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (LRB-AQIM-RRB), which had taken over half of the country. AQAP seized and then lost several cities in southern Yemen in early 2012, resorting to suicide bombings and fighting against Yemeni government forces from remote hiding places.
Al-Shabaab lost its leader Godane in a U.S. missile attack last week and has lost large areas of Somalia that were once controlled by Kenyan, Ethiopian and African Union forces. He has also suffered merciless internal strife. And in Pakistan, the army has gone on the offensive against the Pakistani Taliban -- an Al Qaeda affiliate also divided by division -- in the tribal area of North Waziristan.
Al Qaeda strongholds still exist
There are still many places where Al Qaeda supporters are active and their operations are growing: eastern Libya, Syria and the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt, where they have found space to breathe in the midst of a collapse of state authority. But in the midst of these rapid events, al-Zawahiri has looked more like the cheerleader than the leader, reacting to events rather than directing them.
Last week, in an effort to regain relevance, he announced the creation of al Qaeda in the Indian subcontinent, led by Asim Umar, which will include at least one faction of the Pakistani Taliban. According to a translation from the SITE Institute, the spokesman for the new branch, Usama Mahmoud, said that its basic objectives included jihad against the United States, support for the Taliban and the establishment of a Caliphate - LRB - implicitly rejecting the Caliphate claimed by al-Baghdadi -RRB.
The announcement intensifies the philosophical battle between Al Qaeda and ISIS over how the dream of the Caliphate is achieved, to which Muslims around the world owe allegiance. Mahmoud spoke of a Caliphate where the Emirs are proud of their closeness to honest scholars... a Caliphate in whose shadow even the unbelievers of dhimma-LRB- non-Muslim citizens of an Islamic state-RRB- have a life of security.
The last condition was clearly directed at ISIS and its ruthless campaign against non-Muslims and non-Sunish Muslims both in Iraq and Syria. In order not to be overcome, the ISISpropaganda machine recently published photographs showing residents of the Iraqi city of Nineveh enjoying prosperity under the shadow of the Caliphate.
Al Qaeda’s Hope for the Future
Al-Zawahiri may be seeking the withdrawal of most U.S. combat forces from Afghanistan as his best chance to revive Al Qaeda's fortune. Last week's announcement reiterated Al Qaeda's loyalty to Taliban leader Mullah Muhammad Omar as leader of the Islamic Emirate. Several analysts have also noticed a stream of statements by Al Qaeda suggesting the arrival of a counter-Caliphato.
Daveed Gartenstein-Ross and Thomas Jocelyn pointed out in Foreign Policy that despite the U.S. surge in Afghanistan, the remote provinces of Kunar and Nuristan are home to important cadres of al-Qaeda fighters, and al-Qaeda continues to operate side by side with its allies in other parts of the country.
There is also the prospect, or as some would say, the probability that the ISIS will overtake itself like its predecessor, Al Qaeda, in Iraq, alienating the Sunni tribes, taking territory that cannot defend and mobilizing more enemies than it can resist. If the coalition that is now being built against it can divide Syrian and Iraqi possessions and reward cities like Mosul from its reach, the crucial momentum for its success and appeal will be lost.
The Obama administration seems willing to borrow a page from its anti-Qaeda strategy to deal with ISIS. Last week, Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser, said: We have been able to significantly degrade the Al Qaeda core in Afghanistan and Pakistan, decimating their leadership positions, reducing the threat they pose.
Now a repeat in Iraq of the U.S. strategy that reduced al-Zawahiri to a spectator may be your best chance of overcoming the challenge posed by ISIS. The risk is that Washington and its allies will neglect the imminent challenges in Afghanistan while at the same time refocusing on the militant challenge in Iraq. We've also seen that movie.

"Although in Western philosophy the first formulation of a version of the cosmological argument is found in Plato's Laws, 893–96, the classical argument is firmly rooted in Aristotle's Physics (VIII, 4–6) and Metaphysics (XII, 1–6). Islamic philosophy enriches tradition, developing two types of arguments. Arab philosophers (phalasipha), like Ibn Sina (c. 980–1037), developed the contingency argument, which was taken up by Thomas Aquinas (1225–74) in his Summa Theologica (I,q.2,a.3) and in his Summa Contra Gentiles (I,13). Influenced by John Philoponus (5th c) (Davidson 1969), the mutakallimūm — theologists who used reason and argumentation to support their revealed Islamic beliefs — developed the temporal version of the argument from the impossibility of an infinite regression, now known as the cosmological argument kalām. For example, al-Ghāzāli (1058-1111) argued that everything that begins to exist requires a cause of its beginning. The world is composed of temporal phenomena preceded by other temporarily ordained phenomena. Since such a series of temporal phenomena cannot continue to infinity because a real infinity is impossible, the world must have had a beginning and a cause of its existence, called Allah or God (Craig 1979: Part 1). This version of the cosmological argument entered the medieval Christian tradition through Bonaventure (1221–74) in its phrases (II Sent. D.1, p.1, a.1, q.2).
The Enlightenment thinkers, like Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Samuel Clarke, reaffirmed the cosmological argument. Leibniz (1646-1716) appealed to a reinforced principle of sufficient reason, according to which “no fact can be real or existing and no true statement without sufficient reason to be so and not otherwise” (Monadology, §32). Leibniz uses the principle to argue that the sufficient reason for the ""series of things understood in the universe of creatures"" (§ 36) must exist outside this series of contingencies and is found in a necessary being we call God. Samuel Clarke also used the principle of sufficient reason in his cosmological argument (Rowe 1975: chap. (2).
Although the cosmological argument does not feature prominently in Asian philosophy, a very short version of it, which comes from dependence, can be found in Nyāyakusumjali of Udayana I.4. In general, the philosophers of Nyāya tradition argue that since the universe has parts that come into existence on one occasion and not on another, it must have a cause. We could admit an infinite regression of causes if we had evidence of it, but without such evidence, God must exist as the non-dependent cause. Many of the objections to the argument argue that God is an inappropriate cause because of God’s nature. For example, since God is still and has no body, he cannot be properly told that he causes anything. The Naiyāyikas respond that God could assume a body at certain times, and in any case, God does not need to create in the same way as humans (Potter 1977: 100-07).
The cosmological argument was seriously attacked in the 18th century, first by David Hume and then by Immanuel Kant. Hume (1748) attacked both the vision of causality presupposed in the argument (that causality is an objective, productive and necessary power relationship that has between two things) and the Causal Principle—each contingent being has a cause of its existence—which is at the center of the argument. Kant argued that the cosmological argument, by identifying the necessary being, is based on the ontological argument, which in turn is suspicious. We will return to these criticisms below.
Both theistic and non-theistic in the latter part of the 20th century and in the first part of the 21st century generally show sound skepticism about the argument. Alvin Plantinga concludes “that this piece of natural theology is ineffective” (1967: chap. 1. Richard Gale argues, in Kantian fashion, that since the conclusion of all versions of the cosmological argument invokes an impossibility, no cosmological argument can provide examples of sound reasoning (1991: chap. 7). (However, Gale seems to have changed his mind and in recent writings proposed and defended his own version of the cosmological argument, which we will consider below.) Similarly, Michael Martin (1990: chap. 4), John Mackie (1982: chap. 5), Quentin Smith (Craig and Smith 1993), Bede Rundle (2004), Wes Morriston (2000, 2002a, 2003, 2010), and Graham Oppy (2006: chap. 3) reason that no current version of the cosmological argument is solid. However, dissenting voices can be heard. Robert Koons (1997) uses merology and modal and non-monoton logic to take a “new look” at the contingency argument. In his widely discussed writings William Lane Craig deals with the multidisciplinary evidence of the truth of the premises found in the kalam argument. Richard Gale and Alexander Pruss propose a new version based on a so-called weak principle of sufficient reason that leads to a finite God who is not omnibenevolente, and Richard Swinburne, while rejecting deductive versions of the cosmological argument, proposes an inductive argument that is part of a larger cumulative case for the existence of God.
There is a great possibility that if there is a God, he will do something about the finitude and complexity of a universe. It is highly unlikely that a universe existed without cause, but rather more likely that God existed without cause. The existence of the universe... can be made understandable if we assume it is produced by God. (Swinburne 1979: 131–32)
More recently, Michael Almeida built a new version of the argument based on modal realism. In short, unlike the first half of the last century, contemporary philosophers provide increasingly detailed, complex and sophisticated arguments on both sides of the debate.",C2
"Colonialism is not a modern phenomenon. The history of the world is full of examples of a society that is gradually expanding by incorporating adjacent territory and settling its people in newly conquered territory. The ancient Greeks established colonies as well as the Romans, the Moors and the Ottomans, to name just a few of the most famous examples. Colonialism, then, is not limited to a specific time or place. However, in the 16th century, colonialism changed decisively due to technological advances in navigation that began to connect more remote parts of the world. The fast sailboats made it possible to reach distant ports and maintain close ties between the center and the colonies. Thus, the modern European colonial project arose when it became possible to move a large number of people across the ocean and maintain political sovereignty despite geographical dispersion. This entry uses the term colonialism to describe the European settlement process and political control over the rest of the world, including the Americas, Australia and parts of Africa and Asia.
The difficulty of defining colonialism stems from the fact that the term is often used as a synonym for imperialism. Both colonialism and imperialism were forms of conquest that were expected to benefit Europe economically and strategically. The term colonialism is often used to describe the settlement of North America, Australia, New Zealand, Algeria and Brazil, places that were controlled by a large population of permanent European residents. The term imperialism often describes cases in which a foreign government administers a territory without a significant settlement; typical examples include the struggle for Africa at the end of the 19th century and U.S. domination of the Philippines and Puerto Rico. The distinction between the two, however, is not entirely consistent in literature. Some scholars distinguish between colonies for settlements and colonies for economic exploitation. Others use the term colonialism to describe dependencies that are ruled directly by a foreign nation and contrast this with imperialism, which implies indirect forms of domination.
The confusion over the meaning of the term imperialism reflects the way in which the concept has changed over time. Although the English word imperialism was not commonly used before the 19th century, the Elizabethans already described the United Kingdom as “the British Empire.” As Britain began to acquire dependencies abroad, the concept of empire was used more frequently. Imperialism was understood as a system of military domination and sovereignty over the territories. The daily work of the government could be exercised indirectly through local assemblies or indigenous rulers who paid tribute, but sovereignty rested on the British. The change of this traditional understanding of the empire was influenced by the Leninist analysis of imperialism as a system oriented towards economic exploitation. According to Lenin, imperialism was the necessary and inevitable result of the logic of accumulation in late capitalism. Thus, for Lenin and later Marxists, imperialism described a historical stage of capitalism rather than a transhistoric practice of political and military domination. The lasting impact of the Marxist approach is evident in contemporary debates on U.S. imperialism, a term that generally means U.S. economic hegemony, regardless of whether such power is exercised directly or indirectly (Young 2001).
Given the difficulty of systematically distinguishing between the two terms, this entry will use colonialism as a broad concept that refers to the project of European political domination from the 16th century to the 20th century that ended with the national liberation movements of the 60s. Postcolonialism will be used to describe the political and theoretical struggles of societies that experienced the transition from political dependence to sovereignty.

"Contemporary analytical philosophers, feminists and non-feminist, can be more or less characterized as follows: they consider (some of) Frege, Russell, Moore, Wittgenstein and the Logic Positivists as their intellectual ancestors; they tend to value explicit argumentation and the literal, precise and clear use of language; they often value the roles of language philosophy, epistemology and logic; and they often see their collection of philosophical concepts, methods and assumptions as (a) consistent with their modern European heritage; and (b) in contrast to the methods originating in continental Europe of the twentieth century, most recently those with names beginning with “post”: post-structuralism and postmodernism widely conceived.
Of course, every thread of the mid-20th century, “classical” analytical philosophy has changed a lot. Many central dogmas have been undermined, and non-feminist and non-feminist alike have “naturalized”, “socialized” and otherwise modified previous, more abstract and highly normative companies and doctrines. However, regardless of the extent of the evolution of “analytical philosophy”, the degree to which methodological limits are blurred today, and the fertility of the intersections between methods, several feminist and non-feminist philosophers continue to think of themselves in the historical trajectory of analytical philosophy and find tradition valuable. They claim that the term ‘analytical philosopher’ for themselves, even if some others could find the most appropriate term ‘post-analytic’. [2]",C2
"Every morning, before temperatures in the capital of India begin to rise, a handful of old friends gather together. In the dry grass not far from the India Gate monument in the center of Delhi, they spread, breathe and meditate.
“It’s the only healthy way to start the day. Much better than an egg or sandwich or a cup of tea,” Arvind Singh said at 6.15 a.m. while doing his breathing exercises on a bench.
Singh, a 42-year-old salesman, and his friends are far from alone. Similar scenes are being reproduced throughout India, in overcrowded cities, in whatever green space remains.
June 21 – the new International Yoga Day – Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India, hopes the world will join. The grass near India Gate will become the place for what, expected, will be the largest yoga session ever held, with up to 45,000 people running through a 35-minute routine.
Participants will include Modi, 64, most of his government and, they hope, a number of celebrities. Officials have been sent to gather volunteers from many countries to strengthen the international credentials of the former Indian practice.
Get Indians, and others, the stretching has emerged as something of a focus for Modi, who led his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to an overwhelming electoral victory in 2014. In May 2015, schools were directed to ensure that students attended the yoga events scheduled to coincide with the grand demonstration in Delhi, although it is being held on a Sunday.
Officials have already pointed to the introduction of mandatory yoga for famous Indian police officers out of shape and have said that daily yoga classes will be offered free of charge to three million public officials and their families. Air India, the national company, has also said it will introduce yoga for trainees. More controversially, high-level politicians in India have suggested that a more widespread practice of yoga could reduce the high levels of sexual violence in the country.
Modi, an ascetic who is a committed vegetarian and an enthusiastic yoga practitioner, suggested an international yoga day when he spoke to the United Nations on a visit to New York in 2014.
“Yoga is an invaluable gift from India’s ancient tradition. It represents the unity of mind and body, thought and action, moderation and realization, harmony between man and nature, a holistic approach to health and well-being. It’s not about exercising, it’s about discovering the sense of unity with yourself, the world, and nature,” Modi said at the time, adding that yoga could help in the fight against climate change.
The discipline is between 3,000 and 6,000 years old and originated somewhere in the Indian subcontinent, possibly among religious ascetics. His meditative practices, as well as his physical exercises, have long been associated with local religious traditions such as Buddhism and Jainism, as well as Hinduism practiced by 80% of Indians.
Modi, who began his career as an organizer of a hard-line Hindu nationalist organization, has previously been criticized for promoting a vision of Indian culture that has little place for other traditions. One commentator said the June 21 event was “a mixture of cultural nationalism, commercialization and subtle coercion.”
The novelist Ajaz Ashraf wrote on the Scroll website of India: “Based on it is the hope of bringing modern gurus and their abundant followers, who largely constitute the urban middle classes, to the BJP store.”
Others, however, point to a recent U.S. court ruling. who said that yoga was not inevitably linked to faith. A California court ruled that: “Although the practice of yoga may be religious in some contexts, the yoga classes taught in the [San Diego] district are, as the court of first instance determined, ‘devoid of religious, mystical or spiritual traps. ""This came after two parents claimed yoga in schools promoted Hinduism and inhibited Christianity.
Amish Tripathi, the author of the best-selling novels set 4,000 years ago in India that recount stories of Hindu mythology, said the characters in his books practice yoga.
“In ancient India, it was part of everyday life, both physical and mental. Every culture has given something to the world and this is our gift,” Tripathi said.
Suneel Singh, a South Delhi guru, agreed that yoga did not belong to any religion: “Is t’ai chi only Chinese? Is football only English? Same with yoga. It is a complete package for everyone’s body and a cheap way to keep the hale and heart.”

"The clear indications of panpsychist doctrines are evident in early Greek thought. One of the early presocratic philosophers of ancient Greece, Thales (c. 624-545 BC) displayed an analogical argument for the attribution of the mind that tends toward panpsychism. The argument depends on the idea that beings in mind move themselves. Thales points out that magnets and, under certain circumstances, amber, can move and concludes that they therefore possess minds. It is claimed that Thales went far beyond such particular powers and supported a true panpsychism and pantheism. For example, as reported by Barnes (1982: 96-7), Diogenes stated that Thales believed that ""the universe is alive and full of spirits"", but this observation stems from an earlier statement by Aristotle: ""some say that a soul is mixed throughout the universe—and perhaps that's why Thales thought that everything is full of gods."" While Barnes disputes the pantheistic reading of Thales, he allows Thales to believe in the “ubiquity of animation.” [1]
The presocratics were struck by a dilemma: either the mind is an elementary feature of the world, or the mind can somehow be reduced to more fundamental elements. If one chooses reductionism, it is up to one to explain how reduction occurs. On the other hand, if one opts for the panpsychistic view that the mind is an elementary feature of the world, then one must realize the apparent lack of mental characteristics on the fundamental level. Anaxagoras (c. 500–425 BC) strongly denied that novel elements could emerge from more basic characteristics of reality and instead advanced the view that “everything is in everything” (there are interesting parallels between this and much more recent arguments for the panpsychism of Thomas Nagel and Galen Strawson, discussed below). Anaxagoras explained the appearance to the contrary in terms of a “principle of domination and latency” (see Mourelatos 1986), which affirmed that some qualities were dominant in their contribution to the behavior and appearance of things. However, Anaxagoras' views on the mind are complex, as he apparently considered that the mind did not contain any measure of other things and therefore did not fully comply with its mixing principles. Perhaps this can be interpreted as the affirmation that the mind is ontologically fundamental in a special way; Anaxagoras seemed to believe that everything has some part of the mind in it, while abstaining from the assertion that everything has a mind (even this is controversial, see Barnes 1982: 405 ff. ).
On the other hand, Empedocles, an almost accurate contemporary of Anaxagoras, favored a reductionist narrative based on the famous doctrine of the four elements: earth, air, fire and water. All qualities had to be explained in terms of the proportions of these elements. The general distribution of the elements, which were themselves eternal and immutable, was controlled by “love and struggle” in a cyclical dynamic grand universe. [2] The purest form of reductionism was proposed by the famous atomist Democritus (c. 460-370 BC). Its principle of emergency was based on the possibility that multiform atoms “enclosed” to form an infinity of more complex forms. But Democritus had to admit that the qualities of experience could not be explained in this way, and so he chose to relegate them to non-existence: ""by sweet convention and bitter convention, by hot convention, by cold convention, by convention color of convention; but in reality atoms and void"" (Taylor 1999).
What draws attention to these early attempts to formulate an integrated theory of reality is that the mind and particularly consciousness continue to emerge as special problems. Sometimes it is said that the mind-body problem is not an ancient philosophical concern (see Matson 1966), but it does seem that the problem of consciousness was annoying philosophers 2500 years ago, and in a redolent form of contemporary concerns.
We found these concerns re-emerging at the beginning of the scientific revolution, such as the mechanical picture of the world inaugurated by Galileo, Descartes and Newton put the problem of the mind at the center of the stage while paradoxically sweeping under the carpet. Galileo's matematization of nature seemed to leave no room for the qualities we find in the experience: the redness of the tomato, the spice of the paprika, the sweet smell of flowers. Galileo's solution, in a movement reminiscent of Democritus, was to strip matter of such sensory qualities. This led to the distinction between the “primary qualities” — such as form, size, and movement — that were thought to exist really in matter, and the “secondary qualities” — such as colors, smells, and tastes — that were thought to exist only in the mind of the observer (or to exist as powers to cause ideas in the mind of observers). [3] Galileo and Descartes did not take the radical Christian step of denying the existence of secondary qualities, but placed them in the soul. [4] However, this, of course, led to a radical form of dualism, with a sharp metaphysical division between souls with their secondary qualities and bodies with their primary qualities.",C2

focused on the attributes of (1) population of wild fauna and flora and species diversity, (2) movement of wild fauna and flora in
areas of dispersion and migration, (3) the density and diversity of vegetation, (4) the safety of wildlife and people,
and (5) safety and quality of the environment. Data used were collected from 93 Kisii students

WTP estimates. The regression estimates of the multinomial logit indicated that the respondents were WTP for the
restoration of all attributes except attribute 4. Attributes 1 and 2 obtained the highest WTP and could
be the ones most affected by the two projects. Middle-aged respondents with stable jobs would probably pay
more for restoring attributes compared to students and youth. On the basis of the conclusions,
the government could consider relocating the park to a place with better environmental attributes.

"Illegal discharge is a kind of “moral emptiness” and theft, as much as getting into someone’s pocket and stealing their wallet is a robbery, says author Philip Pullman. In an article for Censorship Index, Pullman, who is president of the Society of Authors, makes a robust defense of copyright laws. It's very critical of Internet users who think it's okay to download music or books without paying for them.
“The technical brilliance is so dazzling that people cannot see the moral misery of what they are doing,” he writes. “It is outrageous that anyone can steal an artist’s work and get away with it. It’s a robbery, as sure as getting into someone’s pocket and taking their wallet is a robbery.”
His article comes after music industry leaders met with British Prime Minister David Cameron on Downing Street, where the issue of web piracy was discussed.
Pullman, writer of the His Dark Materials trilogy, says authors and musicians work for years in poverty and darkness to bring their work to the level “that delights their audiences and, as soon as they succeed, they are taken away from the possibility of earning a living.” He concludes: “The principle is simple and unaltered by technology, science or magic: if we want to enjoy the work that someone does, we must pay for it.”
Pullman is writing in the upcoming issue of the campaign group magazine in a dialogue with Cathy Casserly, Executive Director of Creative Commons, which offers open content licenses “that allow creators to take copyright into their own hands.” Casserly argues that there is much wrong with copyright, which was created ""in an analogue era"". She writes: “By default, copyright closes the door in countless ways that people can share, build and remix each other’s work, possibilities that were unimaginable when those laws were established.”
He says artists need to think creatively about how they distribute and monetize their work, citing science fiction writer Cory Doctorow, who said, “My problem is not piracy, it’s darkness.”
The Censorship Index agrees. The magazine’s editor, Rachael Jolley, said: “The existence of copyright laws does not work in the digital age and runs the risk of criminalizing consumers. We need new models for how artists, writers and musicians make a living with their work.”
The debate is lively and the magnitude of the illegal discharges is enormous. Data collected by Ofcom (the independent regulator and the competition authority for the UK communications industries) suggest that, between November 2012 and January 2013 in the UK, 280 million music tracks were digitally hacked, along with 52 million television programmes, 29 million films, 18 million e-books and 7 million software or game files.
Ofcom has said that 18% of Internet users over 12 years of age admit to hacking content recently, and 9% say they fear being caught. Pullman writes in his article: “The ease and speed with which music can be purchased in the form of MP3 downloads is still surprising for those of us who have been building our iTunes list for some time.”
One thing to emerge from the Downing Street meeting was Cameron's appointment of conservative MP Mike Weatherley to be his advisor on the subject. A spokesperson for the BIS, the commercial agency of the record industry, said: “Mike Weatherley is a strong advocate of copyright and creative artists and producers that he is there to protect. We hope that your influence and Prime Minister’s support for copyright will be affected by the approach of the UK Intellectual Property Office.”

"David Hume (Hume 1748/2000; cf. Voltaire 1764/1901: 272) defined a miracle as “a violation of the laws of nature”, and this definition has been the focus of lively discussion ever since. Hume evidently means to denote something beyond mere changes in the regular course of nature, raising the highest bar so that something qualifies as a miracle, but also raising the potential epistemic meaning of such an event if it could be authenticated.
Bringing the concept of natural laws to the definition of “miracle” is, however, problematic, and for various reasons many writers have found it unsustainable (Brown 1822: 219–33; Beard 1845: 35; Lias 1890: 5–7; Huxley 1894:154–58; Joyce 1914: 17; Hesse 1965; Montgomery 1978; but see Wardlaw 1852: 27–41). First, the concept of a miracle precedes any modern concept of a natural law for many centuries. Although this does not necessarily exclude the concept of Hume, it does raise the question of what concept or concepts previous thinkers had in mind and why the Humean concept should be considered preferable (Tucker 2005). One benefit of defining miracles in terms of violations of natural law is that this definition implies that a miracle is beyond the productive power of nature. But if that's the key idea, then it's hard to see why we shouldn't just use that as the definition and leave out the problematic talk of laws.
Secondly, it is difficult to say in some cases exactly which natural laws are being violated by the event in question (earman 2000). The fact that the dead remain dead is widely observed, but it is not, in the ordinary scientific use of the term, a law of nature that the dead remain dead. The laws involved in the decomposition of a corpse are all at a much more fundamental level, at least in the level of biochemical and thermodynamic processes and perhaps in the level of interactions of fundamental particles.
Thirdly, there are deep philosophical disagreements about nature and even the existence of natural laws. In Hume’s view of the “regularity” of natural laws, it is difficult to see what it would mean to violate a natural law. If natural laws are simply complicit assertions of natural regularities, an apparent “violation” would, of course, be an indication, not that a supernatural intervention in the course of nature had occurred, but rather that what we had thought was a natural law was, in fact, not one. In the metaphysically rich conceptions of natural laws, violations are problematic since laws involve relations of necessity among the universals. And in the view that there are no natural laws at all, the set of events that satisfy the Humea definition of a miracle is, trivially, empty.
Speaking of miracles as violations of the laws of nature also raises questions about the nature of rape. Richard Swinburne (1970) has suggested that a miracle could be defined as a non-recurring counter-instance to a law of nature. If a putative law has a wide scope, great explanatory power, and attractive simplicity, it may be more reasonable, Swinburne argues, to retain the law (defined as a regularity that virtually invariably maintains) and to accept that the event in question is an unrepeatable counter-installation of that law than to discard the law and create a much more complex law that accommodates the event.
One way to overcome all these problems and still retain the Humea formulation is simply to redefine the laws of nature. J.L. Mackie summarizes this perspective clearly:
The laws of nature... describe the ways in which the world — including, of course, human beings — works when it leaves itself, when it does not interfere. A miracle occurs when the world does not leave itself, when something other than the natural order as a whole meddles in it. (Mackie 1982: 19-20)
With the concept of “natural law” thus redefined, the definition of “rape” becomes virtually equivalent to the earlier definition of a miracle as an event that exceeds the productive power of nature. And in the formulation of Mackie it has the desirable characteristic that makes evident the connection between a miracle and a supernatural agency.

"Two planes came too close to each other while attempting to land at a Detroit airport, a federal official said early on Saturday, days after another nearby incident involving three planes at a Washington, D.C. airport.
A Delta flight from Phoenix was scheduled to land Friday night at Detroit Metro Airport as a small regional plane attempted to land, said Elizabeth Cory, spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration.
The two planes were separated by approximately two horizontal miles. “The standard distance of separation is three miles,” Cory said, noting that an investigation is ongoing.
CNN first learned about the incident of an alleged passenger who said he could see a regional plane under them from his cabin window.
Air traffic control was aware that they had a situation where separation was less than they wanted, Cory said.
Both pilots had visual contact with each other and neither of the two aircraft ran the risk of colliding with the other, he added.
Friday's incident in Detroit occurred one day after federal authorities acknowledged that three aircraft operated by US Airways at Reagan National Airport came closer than they should have due to a lack of communication in air traffic control.
Feds investigate 3 planes that fly too close to DC area airport
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon when air traffic controllers were making adjustments to land and leave aircraft due to bad weather.
Chautauqua Airlines' flight reached 800 vertical feet and.82 nautical miles after the departure of an arriving aircraft, identified as a Republic Airlines flight, authorities said.
The third aircraft involved was another Republic Airlines flight, which took off and was 2.07 nautical miles and 800 vertical feet from the flight arriving.
During the change of operations, the lack of communication between Tracon and the DCA tower resulted in the loss of the necessary separation between two regional aircraft leaving runway 1 and a regional aircraft entering runway 19, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.
Tracon, or terminal radar approach control, is a reference to a regional radar installation. DCA is the code of the International Air Transport Association for Reagan National Airport.
At no time were the three planes on a head-to-head course, Transport Secretary Ray LaHood said.
The FAA is investigating and plans to take appropriate action to address the miscommunication of Tuesday's incident.
Such nearby flaws and any operational error are called to action, said Representative John L. Mica, R-Florida, after Tuesday's incident. I'm asking our Aviation Subcommittee staff and FAA to thoroughly review what happened.
Last year, an air traffic controller was suspended for not responding to two planes heading to the national airport after he fell asleep on the midnight shift.
The two planes landed without incident.

"The four seasons are spring, summer, autumn and winter, and although several areas of the United States experience a drastically different climate during these times, all portions of the country recognize the seasons; winter in California can bring heat, and winter in New York can bring blizzards, but both periods are winter nonetheless.
After winter, spring begins on March 20 and ends on June 20 or June 21, in the United States (this date may vary slightly from year to year and hemisphere to hemisphere). For most, spring is a time of ""dishes"", when winter cold and snow are replaced by the sun, reasonable temperatures, green grass, and more. It is also the season in which the bees and butterflies that had been inactive resurface, and when the birds become more active.
Summer follows spring and ranges from June 21st to September 22nd, in America. Summer is the warmest, longest, and (probably) the liveliest of the four seasons; college kindergarten students are given two or more summer months out of class, and to be sure, there are more young individuals out and around during this season than any other. It is not uncommon to see shorts, t-shirts and sunglasses worn by those who are absorbing the hot summer sun, and to stay fresh, many individuals take air conditioning, take a bath in a pool and/or explore the waves of the ocean, which are increasingly comfortable.
Autumn (or autumn), rather than just being a forerunner of winter, is one of the most beautiful and exciting seasons. Waste from September 22 to December 21 (technically, that is, snow will begin to fall long before this last date, in most parts of the country, leading many to classify the period as winter) in the US, autumn is characterized by the fall of leaves, Halloween (October 31), and Thanksgiving. During autumn, traditional farmers harvest their produce, and the fallen leaves mentioned change to beautiful orange, red and yellow colors; these colors are usually associated with autumn itself, in turn.
In the United States, winter runs from 21 December to 20 March, and is, as one might expect, the coldest of the four seasons. In the eastern, northern and central parts of the country, winter snowfalls may be considerable; in the western and southern parts of the country, winter snowfalls are highly unlikely, but temperatures, however, fall from the usual ones. Winter is best known for its snow and Christmas holidays, but it also has New Year's Eve (December 31, in recognition of the beginning of a new year) and other special days. Ice skating, sledding, ice hockey and snowball fights are often enjoyed in winter.",C2
"The Senate Intelligence Committee has passed a bill that would provide greater transparency in the massive collection of American telephone records by the National Security Agency, but will allow the controversial practice to continue. Sponsored by President Dianne Feinstein, the bill allows the NSA to continue collecting telephone metadata from millions of Americans for 90-day renewable periods and allows the government to retain them. Some legislators have alternatively proposed allowing telephone companies to maintain metadata. He approved the committee by a vote 11-4, paving the way for a full Senate vote.
The bill allows analysts to search through the data if they suspect that there is a ""reasonable suspicion"" that a suspect is associated with international terrorism. In addition, the bill allows the NSA to continue to monitor foreigners outside the U.S. if they enter the country ""for a transitional period not exceeding 72 hours"".
The bill is a direct challenge to one presented by Senator Patrick Leahy that would end the collection of national telephone records. Also opposed was Mark Udall, a leading member of the Intelligence Committee, who said he did not go far enough. ""The NSA's invasive surveillance of Americans' private information does not respect our constitutional values and needs fundamental reform, not incidental changes. Unfortunately, the bill passed by the Senate Intelligence Committee does not go far enough to address NSA’s over-scope internal surveillance programs,” Udall said.
Another Democratic member of the committee, Ron Wyden, said the bill maintains “business as usual” and “is still far from anything that can be considered meaningful reform.” Feinstein defended the NSA's massive collection program, but said it was necessary to rebuild public confidence. “The NSA’s call record program is legal and subject to extensive parliamentary and judicial oversight, and I believe it contributes to our national security,” he said in a statement. “But more can and must be done to increase transparency and foster public support for privacy protections.”
In his statement, Feinstein said that the bill would also make a number of improvements to the transparency and oversight of the NSA, including: requiring an annual public report of the total number of NSA telephone metadata database queries and the number of times the program leads to an FBI investigation or probable cause order; requiring the foreign intelligence court to impose limits on the number of individuals in the NSA who may authorize or consult the call record database; establishing criminal penalties of up to 10 years in prison for unauthorized access to data acquired under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) by the United States; ordering the FISA court to impose a limit on the number of contacts that an analyst may receive in response to a bulk communications record consultation.
After the committee hearing, Feinstein strongly supported the NSA's main national programme. “I think there’s a big misunderstanding about this NSA database program, and how vital it is to protect this country,” he told reporters.
Concern over the Intelligence Committee bill was expressed by independent legal experts, who said that the scenario was now ready for a confrontation with the U.S. Freedom Act, a bill submitted by Leahy and Jim Sensenbrenner that would prohibit the massive collection of U.S. telephone records.
Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice said: “The Intelligence Committee Bill and the U.S. Freedom Act present two opposing views of the relationship between law-abiding Americans and the state of national security. The fundamental question is: should the government have any reason to suspect that it has committed a crime before sweeping the most personal information from Americans to feed itself in its databases? Leahy and Sensenbrenner say yes; Feinstein says no.” Wyden suggested that the recent concern over NSA spying on foreign leaders had distracted the real focus on mass domestic surveillance in the United States. “The statements that U.S. intelligence officials have made about collecting about the intentions of foreign management, that’s consistent with the understanding I’ve had for years, as a member of the Intelligence Committee,” he said. “That has implications for foreign policy. My top priority is to put an end to mass surveillance, digital surveillance, of millions and millions of law-abiding Americans.”
Feinstein unexpectedly announced that he was “totally opposed” to the foreign leader spying on the NSA’s behavior of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Feinstein has been a strong supporter of the NSA's massive collection of American telephone records.
“Americans are making it clear that they never – I repeat, never – agreed to give up their constitutional freedoms because of the appearance of security,” Wyden said. “We’re just going to keep fighting this battle. It’s going to be a long one.”
On the other hand, Feinstein said that James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, had agreed to provide him with a written statement about a Washington Post story that claimed that NSA had intercepted data in transmission between Google and Yahoo data centers. She said she was holding back the trial of history until she saw Clapper's rebuttal. His firm support for the collection of national telephone records indicates that the powerful Senate Democrat is not yet ready to expand the criticism of the NSA he has launched, “totally opposing” his surveillance of foreign allied leaders – a more traditional intelligence activity than surveillance of massive telephone metadata.
Wyden would not comment on the Washington Post's report on Google and Yahoo's interceptions. But the senators suggested that it had implications for Americans' privacy of communication. “For decades, countries had their own communication systems. Now that you’ve had the fusion of global communications, I think you’re going to have many more challenges spying on foreigners with implications for American citizens,” Wyden said.

"Gilbert Ryle listed Anderson among the “greater” who had preceded his own generation: philosophers such as Russell, Moore, Wittgenstein, Bradley, Stout, McTaggert, Alexander, Laird and Kemp Smith. For Ryle, Anderson’s generation represented “the old gang,” many of the products of “the dominant Scottish teachers” who had established philosophy as academic discipline at English-speaking universities around the world. Anderson was an exact contemporary of Wittgenstein and Heidegger, yet only seven years older than Ryle himself. But Ryle seems to have a point in suggesting a generation gap that separated him from the “pieces, lords, sagacity, equipment – yes, and fetishes” of that previous generation (Ryle 1976: 383). Ryle was describing the generation of philosophers who were adults before or during the Great War. He only became familiar with Anderson in the 1950s and was struck by the way Anderson had continued a form of philosophy in modern times that had given way to other philosophies more related to linguistic use. Despite this recognition of the interpretative challenges, for many of Anderson’s followers at that time Ryle radically misinterpreted Anderson’s work (Ryle 1950), reading it from the perspective of “linguistic turn.”
For current readers there are indeed several obstacles to approaching Anderson's work. His published works, mainly articles for the Australasian Journal of Philosophy and Psychology and in local magazines and newspapers, are difficult without the context of Anderson's broader teaching. They are generally considered as subsidiaries of Andersonian lectures and learning programs. It seems that they were written for the benefit of students who already had the value of their personal contact. Without this contact, we must rely on the publication of several series of conference notes from Anderson's works by Sydney University Press (see Bibliography). Anderson's isolation from his fellow intellectuals and his apparent reluctance to participate in the international debate also deprive contemporary students of the opportunity to place their work within a more familiar territory.
A point of access to Anderson's work for contemporary students, of course, is found in the work of his students as D. M. Armstrong, John Passmore, and J. L. Mackie. But there is a danger even here that your specialties may distort our view of Anderson's work as a whole. Anderson, as Passmore pointed out, was a generalist (Passmore, Introduction to Anderson's Posthumous Work, Studies in Empirical Philosophy, EMP). Unlike the next generation, he hoped that all spheres of philosophical research would be open to his research and his philosophy would extend to all spheres: logic, metaphysics, ethics, political thought, aesthetics, education.
Anderson describes his position as an empiricist, realistic, naturalist, physical, positivist and pluralist, conceiving each of them as different aspects of the only truly empirical philosophy. But their use of these terms is problematic for the uninitiated. Anderson's empiricism has no time for representative visions of truth, nor for traditional empiricist entities of data or sensory ideas. Empirism for Anderson is an ontological doctrine that affirms a single form of being to which we belong as researchers. Although certainly committed to empirical research and the fallible nature of all propositional claims, Anderson's empiricism is only secondary to an epistemological point of view related to how we come to know things within this space-time world. Anderson's realism rejects traditional realistic-nominalist choices about the existence of universals. Universals are brought to earth (space-temporal), but there are no such things as pure universes or pure details outside their roles within complex states of affairs. Mentality is a product of physicochemical processes in the brain, but this does not prevent our research into the nature of the mind as a field of conflicting tendencies, feelings and emotions. Whatever special sciences tell us about their particular subjects, philosophy retains its authority in questions of logic, that is, in terms of the conditions of possibility of discourse. In fact, modern science is seriously infected by the instrumentalistic and technological viewpoints of its research and needs to become more truly philosophical and critical, more concerned about establishing what is the case within specific fields, and less about being practical and useful in relation to perceived social needs (EMP, 290). Positivism is then for Anderson a commitment to what is objectively and positively the case, and not an instrumental or operational truth program, nor a means of distinguishing between meaningful words and meaningless words. Anderson’s call for an “ethical science” is not an assimilation of ethical research to special science standards. It is a request for an objective investigation of ethics, focused on the existing ethical qualities of human activities, rather than on the pieces of traditional moral philosophy: questions of law, obligation, duty, etc.
Ryle was the first of many to be accused of misinterpreting Anderson. The criticisms of Anderson's position from within English philosophy have always seemed to his followers to lose their mark. They have not generally recognized the ontological, non-representative, non-semantic basis of their empiricism. Robert Brandom’s recent criticism and rejection of the “theoretical, explanatory and strategic commitments” that motivate Anglo-American philosophy in the twentieth century lists them as: empiricism, naturalism, representationalism, semantic atomism, formalism on logic, instrumentalism on practical norms (Brandom 2000). It is extraordinary that none of these criticized traits touch John Anderson's philosophy as they are (at least as Brandom describes them). Brandom considers that the notion of “facts” and “states of things” is emblematic of atomic and representative thinking. Anderson would have responded impatiently as he did with Gilbert Ryle’s “representative” criticisms: “That’s nothing to me.”
Many of the problems that contemporary readers encounter in Anderson's work are the result of his relative international isolation. But for many of his students it was precisely Anderson's traditional secessionist stance that was the key to the great value of Andersonian education. He may have failed in his project, but remained alive in Sydney supporting the values of traditional philosophical research at a time when dominant philosophy was obsessed with linguistic use on the one hand or deference to natural sciences on the other. Many of Anderson's students expected their philosophy to resurface stronger after the inevitable decline of linguistic philosophy and renewed interest in the metaphysical issues that followed this decline. But if his work played any part in this renewal it was only indirectly through the work of his student D.M. Armstrong. Contemporary philosophers interested in metaphysical issues do not refer to Anderson's work and are frankly bewildered by Armstrong's enthusiasm for his master's work. Anderson exists today almost exclusively in the footnotes of his most committed and accomplished students.

"While eating in a restaurant is a pleasant and convenient taste from time to time, most people and families prepare their meals at home. To make breakfast, lunch, and dinner daily, these people must have the food and ingredients required by hand and ready to go; foods and ingredients are typically purchased at a supermarket, or an establishment that distributes food, beverages, household products, and other items that are used by the typical consumer.
Production, or the term used to describe fresh fruits and vegetables, is commonly bought by grocery shop buyers. In terms of fruits, most grocery stores offer bananas, apples, oranges, blackberries, raspberries, grapes, pineapples, melons, watermelons, and more; other grocery stores with selections of larger products could offer the fruits listed, plus less common fruits, including mangoes, honeys, stellars, coconuts and more.
Depending on the grocery store, customers can buy fruits in several different ways. Some stores will charge a fixed amount per pound of fruit, and will weigh customers' fruit purchases and bill them accordingly; other stores will charge customers for each piece of fruit they buy, or for fruit parcels (a bag of bananas, a bag of apples, etc. ); other stores will however simply load through the container.
Vegetables, including lettuce, corn, tomatoes, onions, celery, cucumbers, mushrooms, and more are also sold in many grocery stores, and are purchased in a similar way to the way fruits are. Grocery stores tend to store more vegetables than fruits at any given time, as vegetables stay fresh longer than fruits, generally speaking.
It would take quite some time to list everything else sold by today's huge grocery stores, but most customers take the opportunity to buy basics, or foods that play a prominent role in the average diet, in establishments. Staples include pasta, rice, flour, sugar, milk, meat and eggs, and bread. All the listed commodities are available in pre-packaged packaging, but you can buy ""fresh"" from some grocery stores, where employees will measure and weigh fresh products and then provide them to customers.",C2
"Pregnancy and childbirth have been increasingly medicated in most parts of the world since the early twentieth century. In other words, there are more and more processes that, in fact and as a social ideal, are managed and supervised by medical professionals, usually involve a high degree of technological medical intervention and contact with clinics and hospitals, and are evaluated by medical experts who are the authorities on their progress. Amy Mullin explains that medicalized pregnancy “involves the interpretation of pregnancy itself as a health disorder that necessarily requires expert medical intervention, and think of pregnancy as primarily about health and disease” (Mullin 2005, 54). The concept of medicalization is useful to make clear how this type of insertion in a medical context is not (or not simply) a response to fixed biological facts, but rather a contingent social and institutional process. Death, depression, and short attention span are other examples of processes or conditions that have suffered intense medicalization. In general, medicalization carries benefits and burdens, and the medicalization of pregnancy and birth is no exception. More and more obstetricians would say that intensive medicalization directly promotes good birth outcomes for mothers and babies; rather, almost everyone would recognize that although medical interventions have decreased many risks (e.g. previous placenta death and ectopic pregnancy), other medical interventions have become routine despite not having any proven benefit and some added risks tested for patients (e.g. routine foetal control, normalisation of the position of the litotomy for delivery and episiotomy). Partly because of these mixed effects of increased medicalization, the opposite narratives of pregnancy and birth continue to grow in visibility and support. These narratives may aim to demedicate the notion of normality in pregnancy and birth, or centralize midwife knowledge and competence (e.g., Lyerly 2012; Shaw 2013)
The medicalization of pregnancy and birth takes many forms. Births in North America usually involve a variety of technological interventions, including regular labor-inducing drugs, spinal epidurals, fetal monitoring, and, in about one third of births, surgical delivery. Prior to birth, most pregnancies will involve medical interventions such as genetic testing, ultrasound, prescriptions to control various symptoms and risks, and often increasing technological assistance for conception. However, it is important to note that the rate and intensity at which such interventions are offered or imposed is far from uniform. Dorothy Roberts highlights the striking disparity of benefits she enjoys as a result of medicalization: ""The multimillion dollar apparatus dedicated to technologically facilitating the reproductive choices of rich couples contrasts with the high infant mortality rate among blacks, which remains more than double the rate for whites"" (2009, 784, citing Mathews and MacDorman 2007). Some dimensions of pregnancy medicalization do not directly involve medical interventions. Both inside and outside the clinic, pregnancy is treated as a medical event that requires intense risk management, monitoring and appeal to expert medical knowledge: pregnant women are expected to regulate and monitor their diet, drink, fetal kicks, weight gain, sleeping position, emotions, exposure to household commodities, exercise, sexual activity, and many other aspects of their lives in accordance with standards set by medical professionals (Kukla 2005). Recently, a strong mandate has been given for medical professionals to participate in helping women regulate their bodies in accordance with medical standards to minimize the risk of reproduction even before conception. CDC now recommends that all primary care for all women who may eventually become pregnant (including prepubescents) be treated as “preconceptive care” (Kuehn 2006). Most women cover at least some aspects of medicalization; many take it as part of responsible motherhood to maximize the expert management of their pregnancies and carefully follow the risk minimisation advice (Seigel 2013).
The general tendency to medicate pregnancy and birth has had several ethically significant effects (Davis-Floyd 2004, Duden 1993, Mitchell 2001, Morgan 1998, Sherwin 1992). First, medicalization has encouraged us to imagine pregnancy and birth as inherently high-risk pathological processes that it is irresponsible to undertake without a lot of expert help and surveillance. Secondly, when medical professionals become the main managers of reproduction, the epistemic privilege of pregnant women is undermined and can be said to be reduced to passive roles in their own pregnancies and births (e.g., Freeman 2015). Thirdly, some have argued that medicalization has made pregnancy in general, and childbirth and birth in particular, more alienating and stressful for women, subjecting them to constant and complicated responsibilities for risk management and body and behavioral surveillance (see, for example, Mykitiuk and Scott 2011; Savell 2012).
Among the voices that oppose the medicalization of reproduction are those that insist that pregnancy is a ‘natural’ process that usually does not need technological assistance, and advocate for ‘natural’ childbirth, free of work and pain medications and attended by midwives rather than doctors. There are reasons for philosophers to be as cautious with the ‘natural’ birth movement as with uncritical and uncontrolled medicalization (Kukla 2005, Lyerly 2006 and 2012, Purdy 2001). Typically, their advocates do not specify a clear concept of the “natural”, for example, they do not realize why prescription pain medications are “unnatural” while acupuncture or pain-relieving herbs are “natural”. Nor do they explain why ""natural"" is a better or more ethical prima facie case. More generally, this account of pregnancy and birth implies comparable pressures on pregnant women to conform to rigid standards of attitudes and behaviour, and, like the medicalized narrative, risks depoliticizing and essentializing the experience and management of pregnant women (Beckett 2005, Malacrida and Boulton 2014).",C2
"For the Baron and many others, Leonardo Bruni (1369–1444) was regarded as the paradigm of Italian civic humanism (Hankins 1995: 327; Witt 2003: 392–442), the example of the synthesis of humanist study and public engagement: he served twice as Chancellor of Florence and was intermittently employed in administrative positions by the papacy. At the same time, Bruni was a prodigious author and translator, composing a multi-volume history of the Florentine people (based on their access to primary sources), producing Latin versions of works by Aristotle (including Politics) and other Greek texts, writing biographies of Italian notables for popular consumption, among many other literary activities.
More significantly for today's purposes, Bruni used his great scholarship to defend and promote the cause of the Republican government, especially as practiced in Florence during his time. His Laudatio (1403–1404 [1978]) are paeans to the city in general (for example, in terms of architectural and artistic beauty, its cleanliness, its location, and its abundant resources) but also specifically to the virtue of its citizens and its institutions. (Remember a central feature of the “Thesis of Baron” mentioned above derived from the statement that the crisis of Milan in 1402 gave rise to civic humanism both in theory and in practice, with Bruni as his exemplary exponent.) Like his contemporaries, Bruni believed that Florence had been founded by the Romans during the republican era, making its citizens typically lovers of freedom who also opposed imperial and tyrannical domination. This legacy of Rome also gave rise to the peaceful and peaceful relations of Florence with other Italian cities and its citizens, marked by the protection of all Italy from domination threatened by the Milanese. Florence was indeed the savior of the Italian people.
Both the Panegyrian and the Laudatio explain the greatness of Florence in terms of its autonomous political system. The institutions promote and promote the public virtue of citizens. Bruni postulates a triad of fundamental republican principles that Florence brings together: freedom (freedoms), equality (aequalites) and just right (ius). The Florentine constitution is so organized that citizens are free because they are equal before the law. These qualities lead us to one of Bruni's favorite concepts in his political theory: harmonious cooperation and balance among all groups and classes within the city. Other Italian cities, he observes, are full of class conflict between the great men and the mass of the people. The Florentine Republic differs because the whole body of its citizens participates, as appropriate, in the government, which, because it is controlled in its power, resists the temptation of tyranny, either by a few or by many. Civic humanism, at least as the Baron and scholars who work in a similar line understand it, is perfectly captured in the stories of Florence in the Panegyric and Laudatio.",C2
"The number of Americans submitting new applications for unemployment benefits fell even further last week, suggesting that the labour market was stabilizing as authorities began to loosen pandemic restrictions on business.
Despite signs that layoffs are declining, the Department of Labor's weekly unemployment claims report on Thursday showed that at least 17.8 million Americans were in benefits by mid-January, indicating that long-term unemployment was likely to be entrenched. That could boost President Joe Biden's momentum for the U.S. Congress to approve his $1.9 billion recovery plan.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told ABC's Good Morning America that the massive stimulus plan was needed to overcome the economic pain caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
“It’s too early to predict that this starts a strong investment of extremely high layoffs,” said Robert Frick, a corporate economist at the Federal Navy Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. “Another round of stimuli is important.”
Initial State unemployment benefit applications decreased from 33,000 to 779,000 seasonal for the week ending 30 January. That was the third weekly decline in a row. Economists surveyed by Reuters had predicted 830,000 applications for the last week.
Unadjusted claims decreased from 23,525 to 816,247 last week. Including a government-funded program for self-employed, concert workers and others who do not qualify for regular state unemployment programs, 1,165 million people filed complaints last week, compared to 1,243 million in the previous period.
The claims remain above their peak of 665,000 during the Great Recession 2007-2009, but well below the record of 6.867 million last March, when the pandemic hit the United States.
Part of the rise in claims reflects people reapplying for benefits after the government renewed at the end of December an unemployment supplement of $300 up to March 14 as part of a pandemic aid package worth nearly $900 billion.
“The decline in new claims in recent weeks adds to the evidence that the worst months for the labor market could be very well behind us,” said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Shares on Wall Street were higher. The dollar went up in front of a basket of coins. US Treasury prices were mostly lower.
Although January was the worst month since the beginning of the pandemic, the decline in economic activity stabilized in the second half of the month in the midst of signs of a peak in the recent wave of coronavirus.
The data from Homebase, a payroll programming and monitoring company, showed their measure of employees in the work flattened in the last two weeks of January, stopping the decrease observed between December and January.
Other Thursday data from global company Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed that job cuts announced by U.S.-based employers increased by only 3.3 per cent to 79,552 in January.
The claims report also showed that the number of persons receiving benefits after an initial week of assistance decreased from 193,000 to 4,592 million during the week ending 23 January. Some 17,836 million people received unemployment benefits in all programmes in mid-January, compared with 18,322 million in the first week of 2021.
The data from last week's complaints have nothing to do with Friday's employment report, which is examined closely in January, as it is outside the survey period, which was in the middle of the month. However, signs of stability in other labour market measures support expectations that recruitment rebounded in January after the economy stopped working in December for the first time in eight months.
Expectations that the economy would create jobs last month were boosted by Wednesday's reports showing rebounds in private payroll and employment in the service industry in January. A survey this week also showed that manufacturers hired more workers in January.
According to a Reuters survey of economists' payrolls, it probably increased by 50,000 jobs in January after declining by 140,000 in December. Following rather optimistic reports, Goldman Sachs raised his payroll forecasts from 75,000 to 200,000.
However, some economists are struggling for a second consecutive month of job losses in January. Last week's Conference Council survey showed that consumers' perceptions of labour market conditions deteriorated even further last month.
The economy has recovered 12.5 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April. The Congressional Budget Office estimated Monday that employment would not return to its pre-pandemic level before 2024.
Economists were not disturbed by a separate report on Thursday from the Labor Department showing that workers' productivity fell at an annualized rate of 4.8 per cent in the fourth quarter. This was the deepest rate of decline since the second quarter of 1981 and followed a rate of expansion of 5.1 per cent in the third quarter. The pandemic has brought about radical changes in productivity.
“This decline came after very strong productivity growth in the middle quarters of the year, and we believe that the pandemic has led to a shift in economic activity in some low productivity sectors that has led to a reaffirmation of productivity growth through some noise in quarterly readings,” said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.",C2
"When Leondra Garrett wanted to acquire three new pairs of shoes earlier last year, North Carolina resident split an online purchase of $161 into four installments through a “buy now, pay later” service, in what seemed like a convenient deal.
When purchasing now, paying later (BNPL) supplier tried to withdraw a payment from Garrett's bank account a few months later, she did not have enough funds to cover it. Shortly thereafter, the 42-year-old girl was charged $40 in penalties and her credit score dropped 10 points to 650, a reading generally classified as ‘just’.
“It’s important that consumers always read the fine print and we don’t always read it,” said Garrett, a community organizer from Charlotte.
So called buying now, paying for later services - offered by providers such as Affirme Holdings Inc, Klarna, Afterpay Ltd and PayPal Holding Inc “Pay In 4” - have flourished through retail websites during the coronavirus pandemic as people have become more into online shopping.
However, the ease with which many buyers can shop concerns some regulators around the world, who fear that consumers are spending more than they can afford.
Nearly 40% of American consumers who used “buy now, pay later” have lost more than one payment, and 72% of those who saw their credit score decrease, according to a study by Credit Karma, which offers customers credit score check for free.
The study, conducted for Reuters, surveyed 1,038 adult consumers in the United States to measure the interest in “buy now, pay later” and found that 42 percent of respondents had used the service before.
“The percentage of consumers missing payments is remarkable and not as low as expected,” said Gannesh Bharadhwaj, general manager of credit cards at Credit Karma.
“When you do something so convenient, people may not really be thinking, ‘ Do I have the budget? Can I afford this payment?’ You get more from that impulse buying behavior that leads you to realize that you may not be able to make the payment.”
A lower credit score tells lenders that a consumer can be more risky and makes it harder for the consumer to borrow, either to secure a mortgage or a new credit card. It can even make it more difficult for a consumer to establish utility accounts or find housing, as owners usually make credit score checks before renting apartments.
Management consultants Oliver Wyman estimate that BNPL companies provided between $20 and $25 billion in transactions in the United States last year, although analysts estimate that the size of the BNPL industry varies because it is relatively new and some of the companies are private. Individually, they described explosive growth last year as their services became more frequent.
Afterpay, headquartered in Australia, said it saw US customers more than double to 6.5 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, and its sales more than triple in the July-September quarter of a year earlier.
More than half of Afterpay's customers in the United States are millennials, aged 25-40, he said.
BNPL models vary, as some companies earn most of the profits by charging fees to traders at the point of sale, and others by charging interest and late fees to consumers. They say their services help traders boost sales and consumers to buy the things they need, and cause less financial damage than credit cards because of the restrictions they impose.
However, regulators in Britain and Australia are reviewing or tightening the rules around industry. BNPL service providers, classified as fintech companies, should be subject to stricter rules, such as banks, say some regulators.
It's not clear how to buy now, paying later fits in with U.S. regulations. Because the companies that offer these services do not have bank charters, some do not charge interest and the laws vary according to the state. However, some experts hope that the sector will be given greater scrutiny during the Biden administration.
“One of the questions with the new administration is, what position will the Consumer Financial Protection Office take? – which we hope will be more aggressive,” said Mark Palmer, finance analyst at BTIG Research.
Based in San Francisco, Affirmante saw its revenue increase from 93%, to $509.5 million, in the fiscal year that ended in June. It allows buyers to split purchases in terms ranging from six weeks to four years, with interest rates from 0 to 30%.
Affirming shows customers how much a dollar loan will cost and does not charge late fees or compound interest. Although lost payments may affect credit scores, they claim that they have been working with borrowers who fell in difficult times during the pandemic.
“We approve borrowers only for what they can comfortably pay,” said Silvija Martincevic, Commercial Director of Affirmation. “The reason our technology is significant is that we use machine learning to make subscription decisions.”
In Australia's Afterpay, customers are prohibited from using their services after losing a payment.
The company says 95% of its global transactions are paid on time and late fees contribute less than 14% of the company's total revenue.
The PayPal ‘Pay in 4’ service, launched extensively in the United States in November, allows customers to split purchases ranging from $30 to $600 into four interest-free payments. Late rates can be applied for lost payments, depending on the user's state of residence, according to your website.
The PayPal ‘Pay in 4’ product in the United States does not report transactions or late fees to credit offices, said Greg Lisiewski, Global Pay Later’s Global Vice President.
“We’re working with industry and consumer credit offices to develop the right framework,” he said.
Klarna, based in Sweden, experienced rapid growth over the past year, especially purchases in the range of $100-200, said its U.S. chief, David Sykes.
Most of Klarna's loans are small, short-lived and interest-free, which is safer for customers than credit cards, he said. Customers can delay a payment without penalty. Late rates vary according to the state in line with the regulation, up to a maximum of $21 and the company is implementing a 25% cap.
“No one is being buried in debt to Klarna,” Sykes said. “We’re not borrowing for several years in a car or house.”
Smaller loans with a shorter duration have benefits, but they are not risk-free, experts said. Customers may be taking on more debt than they can handle, even if it comes in portions the size of a bite.
Tamika Rivera, a 35-year-old insurance agent from Springfield, Massachusetts, uses multiple purchases now, pays for later services, and has lost payments. In one case, she didn't have enough money to cover a $43 sweater purchase, resulting in a $35 overdraft rate from her bank.
“These services are convenient but there are some negative things that can happen,” Rivera said.
Alan McIntyre, head of Accenture's global banking practice, says the credit impact of the purchase now, the later payment trend is yet to be seen.
“The optimistic idea is that millennials don’t want to go into debt and want to build a better budget – this is deferred debit and are not tempted to change it,” he said.
“The pessimistic view is that about 40% of people who use it do so because they cannot access traditional credit, either because they have reached their credit limit or because of a poor or non-existent credit history, and some of these loans may not have a good season.”

"Margaret Thatcher, the most dominant British prime minister since Winston Churchill in 1940 and world champion of the economic revival of the free market at the end of the 20th century, has died. The British government announced that it would receive a ceremonial funeral with military honors at St. Paul's Cathedral.
British Prime Minister David Cameron, who is cutting off his trip to Europe to return to London after the news, said: “It was with great sadness that I learned of Lady Thatcher’s death. We have lost a great leader, a great prime minister and a great British.” He added: “As our first female prime minister, Margaret Thatcher succeeded against all odds, and Margaret Thatcher’s real thing is that she not only ran our country, but saved our country, and I think she will become Britain’s greatest prime minister in peace time.”
In a statement, President Barack Obama said: “Here in the United States, many of us will never forget his shoulder to shoulder with President Reagan, reminding the world that we are not simply driven by the currents of history, we can shape them with moral conviction, unwavering courage and iron will.”
The first woman elected to lead a major western state, Lady Thatcher, when she became after the longest premiere since 1827, served 11 uninterrupted years on No. 10 Downing Street.
Thatcher, 87 years old, has been deteriorating health for a few years, suffering from dementia. After a series of mini strikes in 2002, Thatcher retired from public life, he is no longer able to make the kind of wasp statements that had been his fort in office – and beyond.
His death was received with tributes from the entire political spectrum.
As Labour sources announced that the party would suspend the campaign in the local elections as a sign of respect, its leader, Ed Miliband, said: “It will be remembered as a unique figure. He reformed the politics of an entire generation. She was Britain's first female prime minister. She moved the center of British politics and was a huge figure on the world stage. The Labour Party disagreed with much of what it did and will always remain a controversial figure. But we can disagree and also respect to a great extent their political achievements and their personal strength.”
Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: “Margaret Thatcher was one of the defining figures in modern British politics. Whatever side of the political debate he is in, no one can deny that as prime minister he left a unique and lasting footprint in the country he served.”
In describing it as a political phenomenon, former conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major said: “Its outstanding characteristics will always be remembered by those who worked closely with it: courage and determination in politics, and humanity and generosity of spirit in private.”
The “Iron Lady” proved to be an important cold war ally of U.S. President Ronald Reagan in the final confrontation with the Soviet Union, which broke under reformist pressures led by Mikhail Gorbachev, Kremlin leader with whom Thatcher declared that he could “do business. ” As a result, many voters from the former Soviet bloc states saw her as a bold advocate of her freedom, a widely shared opinion across the spectrum of US dominant opinion, though not at home or among the EU's main partners.
Thatcher was an unprecedented middle-ranking conservative until she unexpectedly became party leader in 1975. In a decade, she had become known all over the world – both admired and hated – for her pro-market internal reforms and unrelenting foreign policy attitudes, including her long battle with the IRA, which almost succeeded in killing her when she planted a bomb at the Grand Hotel, Brighton, in 1984.
At home, the emerging doctrine of Thatcherism meant the denationalization of state industry – the new word ""privatization"" came into use in many countries – and the defeat of militant trade unionists, in particular the National Union of Miners, whose one-year strike (1984–85) was bitter and traumatic.
Driven by the newly arrived revenues from the North Sea oil fields, Thatcher had room to maneuver and change the aging industrial economy and took the opportunity to defeat his enemies, including moderate members of his own party.
But he also deployed in the European Union his notorious “handbands,” or verbal attacks, to get a British discount – “my money,” as she called it. She was less successful in defending herself from the centralizing ambitions of the “Belgian Empire”, her description of the European Commission, especially in the years when she was headed by the French socialist Jacques Delors.
Her allies in the tabloid press excited her. And as the British economy recovered from the severe recession its monetarist medicine had inflicted on it – to tame trade unions and cure inflation – it seemed briefly invincible.
But unbridled power, with the defeat or withdrawal of the allies who had kept it under control, led to errors and growing unpopularity. When Sir Geoffrey Howe, nominally his deputy, finally fought with Thatcher – mainly about Europe – his devastating resignation speech triggered a leadership challenge. Thatcher gave way to John Major instead of risking losing him in a vote.
In retirement, he wrote highly successful memoirs in two volumes and campaigned energetically on behalf of the Thatcher Foundation, which tried to promote its values around the world.

"As we commemorate the twenty-fifth celebration of World AIDS Day on 1 December, we have a golden opportunity to begin ending the HIV/AIDS pandemic.
To begin with, this has been an extraordinary year for research on HIV/AIDS, with advances in headlines that are undeniable proof of progress towards a cure.
The first documented case of a child cured of HIV, reported in March, was followed in July by a report of two adult HIV patients who no longer showed any signs of viruses after having undergone stem cell transplants and stopping antiretroviral treatment.
Much remains to be done before these and other scientific advances can be translated into a widely applicable cure that can be made available to the 35 million people living with HIV/AIDS around the world.
But it is an irony that borders on the tragedy that, like a cure for HIV/AIDS is beginning to look like a realistic proposal, tight austerity measures could stop our momentum, paralyze our progress and frustrate our hopes for ending AIDS in our lives.
As a result of the hijacking of the United States budget, the National Institutes of Health -- the engine of progress in AIDS research for 30 years -- will lose $229 million in AIDS research funding next year.
This limits a sad decade for AIDS and other support for biomedical research: From 2003 to 2012, NIH lost 22 of its purchasing power as a result of stagnating funding levels.
This hammer blow to AIDS research funding will be accompanied by cuts to a number of other HIV/AIDS programmes, cuts that will have a negligible impact on the federal deficit but will have real consequences for people living with HIV/AIDS in the United States and around the world.
Alicia Keys: Out loud on the fight against HIV
Based on the latest available data, amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research, has estimated that the reduction in funding for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief - LRB-PEPFAR-RRB - could only result in 228,000 fewer people receiving HIV treatment. This could lead to up to 52,000 AIDS-related deaths and could leave more than 100,000 children orphaned.
The Institute of Medicine has said that PEPFAR has been globally transformative and has had significant positive effects on the health and well-being of individual beneficiaries, on the institutions and systems of partner countries and on the overall AIDS response.
Interactive: World AIDS Day and what it means
Why, then, are we shortening a program that enjoys broad bipartisan and popular support, has done more than any other foreign policy initiative in recent years to burn the image of the United States abroad, and has already altered, but not irreversibly, the trajectory of the HIV/AIDS pandemic?
Nor will people living with HIV be saved here in the United States. amfAR also estimates that the kidnapper could cause some 15,000 Americans who need help paying for their medications to lose support from the AIDS Assistance Program.
And more than 4,000 households could lose housing aid as a result of cuts in the federally funded housing opportunities program for people with AIDS. All these cuts will fall disproportionately on people of color.
Just a few years ago, many considered the notion of a cure for HIV heretical. I was creating false hopes. It wasn't technically feasible. It couldn't be done. All this changed with the first reports, in 2008, of Timothy Brown, the Berlin patient.
While on HIV treatment, Brown was diagnosed with leukemia. To treat leukemia, she received a stem cell transplant... with a twist. His wise German doctor deliberately sought, and found, a stem cell donor among a very small group of people born with a genetic mutation that makes them highly resistant to HIV infection. After the transplant, Brown was able to stop HIV treatment without experiencing a return of the disease.
Zero new HIV infections among children can be a reality
Similarly, the idea of an AIDS-free generation today is shaken with abandonment. It wasn't always like that. But for more than 30 years, we have developed a series of tools that enable us to effectively prevent and treat HIV infection. In addition, research has shown us conclusively that treatment is prevention. Putting people on antiretroviral drugs makes them less infectious and less likely to transmit the virus to others.
Combine a wider deployment of these tools with an expansion of programs such as PEPFAR and a sustained investment in research, and you have a trifecta: a winning combination that could achieve the conquest of the AIDS pandemic in the foreseeable future.
Back off on AIDS, and you'll practically guarantee that we'll take care of it for generations.

"The beginning of the year is probably the first time to feel sad about work: it is ages until the next vacation, and it is night in the morning and when you arrive home. And, if you're stuck in a job you don't like, it might be enough to have to get to your CV.
But, before you start looking through job ads, try to put things in perspective. So what else could you be doing instead? We asked five people who did some unusual jobs how much they were paid, what the worst parts were and why they enjoyed their work.
1. Dog food taster
Work: Tasting food for dogs to make sure it meets the quality standards of a premium brand
What it means: Open sample cans of each newly made batch of dog food (or cats), smelling it and eating it. “Although the palates of dogs are different from ours, the taste is an important quality control to ensure that each different ingredient is perfectly balanced in the right way,” says Philip Wells, the main taster of the Lily’s Kitchen pet food. “Trying food is also a good way to capture the nuances of cooking; this works especially well in dry food.”
Typical salary: £20,000 for an entrance level job in the quality department. However, Wells says that £50,000 or more is “easily achievable” for an experienced technical director who, as well as tasting products, is also likely to be responsible for developing new recipes and advising the business on technical and regulatory issues. The worst part of the job: The deadlines, for Wells, who admits he likes food. The meat used in pet food has to be derived from animals passed as fit for human consumption, according to the Animal Feeding Regulations 2010, and says that the company uses “fresh food of fresh human quality” in its recipes. He adds: “There are some rather gruesome pet foods out there and, although I don’t taste them, the smell is enough to turn the stomach when I do some market research.”
Job satisfaction: “There are not two days that are always the same.” It is gratifying, says Wells, that a project he has worked on “will help pets be happier and healthier.” However, he acknowledges that part of the credit should go to another “key member” of the tasting team: Lily, the border terrier.
2. Hygiene technician
The work: Disinfect areas that have been potentially exposed to biohazard situations
What it means: Clean up crime scenes, traffic accidents and suicides. Cleaning the houses of hoarders full of garbage, rats and excrement... among other things. “The job is to keep people safe,” says Richard Lewis, a hygiene technician at Rentokil. “We take care of some very disturbingly dirty places.”
Typical salary: The entry level salary is usually around £14,500 and a higher salary can be up to £22,000. Worst part of the job: Cleaning after suicides. “You get used to the work being disgusting, but the emotional side of it remains difficult.” You learn not to take your job home, he says. “You also have to have a sense of humor, as some days can be difficult.”
Job satisfaction: Lewis finds the variety of tasks exciting. “One day, I’m cleaning after a corpse; another day, I’m in a prison cell or 100 feet in the air being lowered to a silo to clean it.” He also takes pride in the transformation it produces: “It’s satisfying to return a potentially dangerous site to a safe environment. And bene fits with society.”
3. Biogas engineer
Work: Creation of biogas plants in developing countries
This involves: Linking a digester system – which can be filled with human excreta, animal manure and other waste products – to toilets to produce biogas that can be used for cooking and lighting. “We need to know what size and shape the mixer well should have, how to create the optimal temperature for digestion and where to place the biogas plant,” says Baburam Paudel, technical director of the Renewable World charity in Nepal. “We also need to convince poor communities that poo can be productive – many are repelled by the idea of connecting their toilets to their kitchens.”
Typical salary: An entry level salary is about £10,000, while a typical salary for a technical chief is £30,000. The worst part of the job: For Paudel, it is to see people struggling to survive on very little income. But, admit, anyone who doesn't change a diaper would fight. “You have to be willing to get your hands dirty during the construction process and inspections. As expected, anaerobic digestion (the process that occurs when bacteria eat decaying waste and produce methane) smells like rotten eggs. It can be disgusting and there is no place for mistakes.”
Job satisfaction: “It’s immensely satisfying to know that I’m helping people increase their income and allowing girls to attend school by replacing the need to collect firewood,” says Paudel. “My work improves the health and hygiene of entire communities.”
4. Eel Ecologist
Work: The conservation of European eel in critical danger
What it means: Watching the size of endangered eels, environmentalists enter the Thames and other rivers and swamps in London full of eels, sometimes up to their armpits, and reach a network full of up to 20 adult eels to grab one with their own hands. “Adult eels can be one meter long, or even larger, and weigh up to 2 kg. They are not dangerous at all, but they are almost pure muscles and can be a little viscous,” says Stephen Mowat, eel conservationist and environmentalist of the London Zoological Society. “We have to weigh them and measure them, and they twist... a lot. It is difficult to look professional while crawling on the ground chasing an eel through the grass.”
The worst part of the job: “Eels are really complicated creatures to work with – and being smarter than an eel can be pretty embarrassing,” says Mowat. “You also have to be ready to jump from one project to another. I once had to dissect a tub of dead eels to examine the parasites living in them, moments before jumping into a suit for a meeting with government officials. I remembered washing my hands.” But, for Mowat, the worst part of the job is definitely not to handle eels – he believes that baby eels (known as elvers) are “as cute as pandas”: “The worst part of the job is to learn regularly how much damage we are doing to the environment, the British population.”
Job satisfaction: “Getting to work outdoors and seeing British wildlife close up is the best part of the job,” says Mowat. “Eels are beautiful creatures and working with eels not only benefits eel: it helps entire river systems, estuaries and coastal habitats. That’s something worth working on.”
5. Leader of the shopping channel
Work: Sale and demonstration of a wide range of products on live television
What it means: Present hours and hours of monotonous content, at the same time as demonstrating the products and seem enthusiastic and knowledgeable about everything you are selling. “I prepare and research as much technical and practical information as possible about each product in advance,” says Shaun Ryan, host of Ideal World TV. “But you also need the ability to relate to each genre of products and to each viewer.”
Typical wage: An apprentice presenter would start with a minimum of £30,000, while an experienced presenter can expect more than £55,000.
The worst part of the job: “Insociable hours,” Ryan says. “An experienced presenter like me usually works at maximum audience times, which means that every weekend, holidays and very late at night, in addition to the occasional 5 a.m. shift.” His worst task, he says, was just to sell some women’s slimming pants: “It was a very difficult hour and not my fi nest.”
Job satisfaction: “I love the rush to show up live and have to think up every second,” Ryan says. “It also gives me a lot of adrenaline to know that sometimes I have thousands of spectators asking for the product I just presented.”

"It is becoming difficult, even for a defense attorney, to follow up on the charges against Bill Cosby. Recently, the lawyers of the beleaguered comedian filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit accusing the comedian actor of sexually assaulting the plaintiff Judith Huth in 1974 at the Playboy mansion when she was 15.
Huth claims that she and a 16-year-old friend met Cosby in a Los Angeles movie. A week later Cosby allegedly gave them drinks at a tennis club, after which the lawsuit says Cosby took her to the Playboy mansion. At the mansion, Cosby allegedly forced her to perform a sexual act with him.
Cosby and his lawyers aren't gonna go quietly into the good night. They have filed a death complaint challenging the legal sufficiency of the claims or the complaint itself. A demurrer essentially says that the complaint is as flawed as it is written, that it must be dismissed His lawyers have also gone to the offensive, asking the court to impose sanctions on the lawyers who filed this lawsuit.
In the public opinion court, many have already come to the conclusion that there is something in these growing accusations. On the other hand, perhaps the public opinion jury will be influenced by Camille Cosby's replica today that her husband's media coverage is comparable to the article about the alleged gang rape of Rolling Stone UVA. The verdicts in the public opinion court are mercurial and are rarely restricted by the same restrictions applied by the judiciary.
However, in the royal court, the rules are different. Huth's lawyers should have complied with these rules. If they knew it was impossible to comply with the rules, then the lawyers knew when they filed the complaint that it was fatally flawed. Regardless of the breakdown in communication between counsel and client, this complaint should probably be dismissed.
Cosby breaks his silence
Huth filed his complaint long after the time allowed by the prescription. Statutes of limitations are laws that establish the maximum period during which one can wait before filing a claim, and vary depending on the state and type of case. By definition, they deny access to a substantive claim for a purely procedural reason.
Although statute of limitations were arbitrary, public order was not arbitrary: defendants also deserved the protection of the law. It makes sense that you don't have to be brought to court tomorrow for a fender party that you got into with your 1977 AMC Gremlin... in 1977.
But there's a big difference between a minor traffic accident and cases of sexual assault. Prescription periods are more controversial in cases of sexual assault because complainants, sometimes children, repress memories or fear. In fact, the abject terror or trauma caused by an aggressor may be the reason why the victim allows the statute of limitations to extend.
Accordingly, some jurisdictions have special rules that extend the time limit for filing complaints in cases of child sexual abuse. Under California law, the only way an alleged victim of child sexual abuse can file a lawsuit that would otherwise not be enforced is to claim that the psychological injury was repressed and was only discovered in the last three years.
Since this is a period of potentially unlimited limitations, the rule contains two important safeguards to avoid unfounded claims and protect the rights of potential defendants.
First, in asserting claims based on alleged child sexual abuse, a complainant over 26 years of age has to submit certificates of merit, documents executed by an authorized mental health professional certifying that the allegations are substantiated. Cosby's lawyers correctly point out that Huth did not submit the necessary certificates, which exposes the complaint to attack. The public policy behind this rule is sound: taking the word of a plaintiff who repressed a memory that made them lose the statute of limitations invites uncertainty and fraud.
Huth was 15 years old in 1974, when the alleged abuse took place, and at least 55 years when he filed this lawsuit. However, Cosby's lawyers point out that he tried to sell this story to tabloids more than nine years ago. Even if Huth is allowed to present these certificates, which medical professional will certify his memory lost until three years ago from an event he tried to profit from by selling the word a few years before that?
Secondly, the rule provides some protection to potential defendants and their privacy. After all, demanding some initial scientific proof of a repressed memory and injury is a good idea, but a medical provider cannot really provide any assurance about the identity of an aggressor -- apart from relying on the patient's words.
That is why a plaintiff is prohibited under the rules of identifying the defendant by name until the court gives him permission. Huth could have complied with this rule by naming Cosby as John Doe, or some anonymous designation. He didn't. His lawyers filed his complaint by naming Cosby.
You might think that this is just a clerical joke that could be remedied, as many are, by filing a modified complaint - LRB- as she finally did -RRB-. Cosby's lawyers point out that this is not a simple mistake that can be fixed. The plaintiff already identified Cosby in the complaint before obtaining judicial permission.
Even if Huth amended his complaint, Cosby's name is out there. Like Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton, and many in Sony have learned, you can't unhook the privacy bell -- once your name -LRB- or image -RRB- is out there, it's out there.
Child sexual abuse is a detestable crime, and injuries last a lifetime. Recognizing this, modern jurisdictions have modified the statute of limitations normally inflexible to allow victims their day in court, while trying to protect future defendants from unmeritorious claims. Huth's case illustrates that these rules are not merely procedural. Violating these standards of protection threatens the public perception of other legitimate victims who want their day in court.
The public opinion court will probably ignore these violations as technicalities, and will continue to judge and condemn Cosby. That's how that court works... unfettered by the inconvenience of the rules of procedure or evidence. But, under the California High Court rules, this complaint must be dismissed.

"She is the star of one of the longest and most successful film series in the world, with 23 films and over $6 billion accumulated in the global box office, but James Bond shows no signs of a slowdown. In fact, Bond's brand is stronger than ever, after Skyfall's record performance, which became the biggest movie ever at the UK box office in 2012 and, with its total profits of $1.1 billion, it is currently in ninth place of the highest revenue ever.
Hence the intense interest surrounding the announcement of a few more details of the film of the 24th Bond, especially its official title, Spectre. Question number one is this: Can Spectre repeat Skyfall's trick? Will Skyfall remain a high water mark for Bond film or can Spectre extend this winning race?
Charles Gant, film editor of Heat magazine, says the indications are that it’s going in the right direction.” Skyfall was a brilliant strategic movement,” he says. “It intelligently positioned itself as modern and retro at the same time. He appealed to fans of the Daniel-Craig era, who are relatively newcomers to the franchise, and also managed to involve the oldest and nostalgic elements of the audience, who may have lost interest in the few previous films. With the new title,” he adds, “they’re about to win. My feeling is that Spectre announces that they want to cling to nostalgic Bond fans with more age diversity, as well as retain the younger audience.”
The initial signs are that Eon Productions, the company originally founded in 1961 to make Dr. No and behind all the “officials” Bonds, is doing its best to ensure that lightning strikes twice installing the key creative talent behind Skyfall in Spectre. Daniel Craig has been tied to at least Bond 25, while the same writers have produced the script.
But it's Director Sam Mendes' recapture that gives Bondwatchers the greatest hope. A director mainly known for character studies such as American Beauty and Revolutionary Road, Mendes has taken the Bond series to new heights. Gant says: “Mendes managed to relate to both modern and traditional Bond audiences, and also attracted high-caliber actors like Ralph Fiennes. To attract actors like Fiennes, they have to be happy with the director.”
Among other achievements, Skyfall almost doubled the box office of its predecessor, Quantum of Solace, which achieved a global figure of $586 million at its launch in 2008. Nobody expects anything like that this time, but Eon won't be complacent.
Although the Bond series was not in trouble before the arrival of Mendes – and Craig – there was a sense of a certain amount of rancid towards the end of Pierce Brosnan's career. The series had survived the drying up of Bond's real stories to adapt, the films that had long been drawn from any resemblance to the originals of Ian Fleming, but lacked a certain dynamism.
This cycle, however, was nothing new: the story of the Bond series has been of reflux, stasis and renewal, spinning more obviously around the main actor: first, Sean Connery; then, successively, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Brosnan and, now, Craig. Each appointment has been a response to the status of the series and some have worked better than others.
Lazenby lasted only one film, while Dalton's two efforts, The Living Daylights and License to Kill coincided with a period in the late 1980s when the film 007 had been completely overshadowed by more aggressive and skillfully produced Hollywood action films. According to Gant, “the period of Roger Moore’s last, entering Dalton, did not really excite the public. Brosnan saw a small commercial upturn, while Craig has taken him to new levels. On the other hand, the first Bonds were incredibly commercial, sexy and exciting movies, and there was very little around like them.”
It is worth noting that, although Skyfall's real revenue dwarfs all the other Bond films, the performance of some of the 1960s entries in the series was almost as brilliant in comparison. With the figures adjusted for inflation, the 1965 release, Thunderball, is just a hair wide below Skyfall, while Goldfinger and You Only Live twice surpassed Craig's other films (like the 1970s bonuses, The spy who loved me and lived and let me die). According to this calculation, License to Kill is the worst performance of all Bonuses, with Moore's last effort, A View to a Kill, in second to last place.
However, Bond brand has remained immensely powerful over the decades, with Eon being forced to defend himself against rival teams' attempts to capitalize on the popularity of the series. Through a rare ownership of the rights, the adaptations of Casino Royale (in 1967) and Thunderball (like Never Say Never Again, in 1983) were launched in competition with Eon's productions. Although subject to legal disputes for several decades, Eon now has full control of both books.
Casino Royale, whose rights had been sold individually by Fleming in 1955, finally passed to Eon in 1999 as a result of an agreement between Eon sponsors, MGM, and Hollywood's rival Sony studio - thus clearing the way for the 2006 version. Thunderball, on the other hand, owed its disputed status to writer-producer Kevin McClory, who helped Fleming sketch the original story and claimed ownership of the novel for decades thereafter, and produced Never Say Never Again as a result. After McClory's death in 2006, his family finally settled with MGM and Eon's parent company in November 2013.
If the initial wave of enthusiasm for Bond films lasted until the 60s and 70s, it is fair to say that the series almost stopped after the poor figures of License to Kill. Goldeneye, the first of Brosnan's efforts, announced a dramatic renewal: not only for a new actor, but, more importantly, for whom he was behind the camera.
However, after a six-year break, Eon installed Martin Campbell in the chair: another experienced British director who was able to orchestrate one of the most elaborate stunts in Bond's history. Goldeneye's opening scene, during which Bond freely falls into the cockpit of a light aircraft without a pilot, did much to revitalize and modernize the series on his own. In addition, a whole new generation was reached through a hugely successful Goldeneye video game spin-off, making a significant contribution to the perception that Bond's film was no longer stale and outdated.",C2
"The inventor of a state-of-the-art computer-assisted autopsy system that is increasingly used in European hospitals has stated that the technique could mean that there is no such thing as a ""perfect murder.""
The method, called 'Virtopsia', is now being used in selected forensic medical institutes in Europe, having been pioneered by a group of scientists at the University of Zurich. Instead of looking for the scalpel and making the Y-shaped incision in the chest with which a traditional autopsy begins, pathologists can now examine the body in 3-D through computer screens.
Michael Thali, director of the Zurich Institute of Forensic Medicine in Europe, and one of Virtopsia's inventors, said he had the potential to revolutionize criminal investigations. “Basically there will no longer be such a thing as the perfect murder, as a virtual autopsy allows you to find every piece of evidence,” he said.
Virtopsias combine images of high-power magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) and superficial scans of dead bodies. Combined, devices are called 'Virtobot'. The technique allows the detection of injuries such as injuries and often undetectable blows during a traditional autopsy, as well as air bags, heart attacks and even cancer.
“Virtopsia has the potential to replace the autopsy one day,” said Richard Dirdorfer, one of the pioneers of DNA analysis in criminology, and a Virtopsia developer founder, to the German scientific journal PM. “I think we’ll see this happen gradually, just as DNA analysis gradually replaced blood group analysis,” he said.
Computerized imaging techniques allow doctors to obtain in-depth information about the deeper interiors of corpses. The method has already allowed the discovery of hemorrhages and fractures that were not collected during conventional autopsies. The initial objective is to use the new method to complement the traditional autopsy.
“It will allow forensic scientists to plan their autopsies much more efficiently,” he told Spiegel Dominic Wichmann, an internal medicine specialist at Hamburg University Hospital. Criminologists from all over the world have been traveling to Switzerland in recent years to see the development of the new method for themselves.
The U.S. medical forensic drama CSI has already presented Virtopses twice. In one, the system was able to prove that a murder victim was killed by a bullet in the cheek; in another, a virtopsia in a murdered man meant that his desire to be cryogenically frozen could move on as his body remained intact.
The method has been in development for decades, with the scientists behind it first housed in an unheated laboratory on a university campus where they were considered a bit of a laughing stock. Later, a donation from a rich ophthalmologist allowed the project to take off. Even then it was initially rejected for its potential to undermine the traditional skills of forensic scientists and pathologists. But a new generation seems to view it as a lesser threat and rather as something that will complement and underlie conventional methods and possibly even one day will replace them, although probably not entirely.
“To analyze the color of the blood, the consistency (of the body fluids) or odors, we will have to continue with the conventional cut,” said Lars Oesterhelweg, Deputy Director of the Institute of Forensic Medicine at the Charité Hospital in Berlin, who is using a version of Virtopsia.
He added that the new method was particularly useful in revisiting cases where the cause of death was unclear. “It means that third-party opinions can be gathered, investigations can be re-examined and cases can be reopened,” he said.
Scientists using the new method said that relatives of the dead, who are often reluctant to have autopsies performed because of the disfigurement they cause, were much more interested in the non-invasive method.

"That formulation of the basic idea is perhaps too short to be easily intelligible, and it certainly benefits from a little elaboration. The characterization of alienation offered here—as a social or psychological evil involving the problematic separation of a subject and an object belonging to oneself—includes three constitutive elements: a subject, an object and the relationship between them. It will be useful to say a little more about each of these in turn.
First, the subject here is a self; typically, but not necessarily, a person, an individual agent. ‘Not necessarily’ because the topic could also be, for example, a group of some kind. There seems to be no good reason to deny that both a collective agent and an individual agent might be alienated from some object. For example, just as Anna is alienated from her government, it could be that women or citizens are alienated from her government.
Secondly, the relevant object may take various forms. These include: entities that are not a subject; another subject or subjects; and oneself. The object here could be an entity that is not a subject; for example, Beatrice could be alienated from the natural world, from a social practice, from an institution, or from social norms, where none of those entities is understood as agents of any kind. In addition, the object could be an entity that is another subject, another person or group; for example, Beatrice might be alienated from her childhood friend Cecile, and Beatrice might also be alienated from her own family. Finally, the object here could be the original subject; that is, there could be reflexive variants of the relationship, for example, in which Beatrice is alienated from herself.
Thirdly, the relationship is one of problematic separation between a subject and an object that properly belong together. In this account, all these elements are required: there has to be a separation; separation has to be problematic; and it has to be obtained between a subject and an object that belong properly together.
The idea of separation is important. Not all problematic relationships between the relevant entities imply alienation. For example, being overly integrated into some other object could also be a problematic or dysfunctional relationship, but it is not what is often thought of as alienation. Imagine, for example, that Cecile has no life, no identity, no meaning, other than her belonging to the family. It is tempting, at least for modern individuals, to say that she has an ‘unhealthy’ relationship with her family, but it would seem strange to say that she was alienated from her. Alienation is typically a problematic separation from something.
What I call problematic separations could be indicated by a wide variety of words and phrases. No particular vocabulary seems to be required by the basic idea. The linguistic variety here could include words that suggest: breaks (""splits"", ""ruptures"", ""bifurcations"", ""divisions"", etc. ); isolation (‘indifference’, ‘insignificance’, ‘impotence’, ‘disconnection’, etc. ); and hostility (""conflicts"", ""antagonism"", ""dominion"", etc.). All this, and more, could be ways to indicate problematic separations of the relevant type. Of course, particular authors may use language more systematically, but there seems to be little reason to insist that a specific vocabulary is required by the basic idea.",C2
"The anarchist rejection of authority has application in epistemology and in philosophical and literary theory. A significant use of the term appears in American pragmatism. William James described his pragmatist philosophical theory as a kind of anarchism: “A radical pragmatist is a kind of happy-fortunate anarchist creature” (James 1907 [1981: 116]). James had anarchist sympathies, connected to a general critique of systematic philosophy (see Fiala 2013b). Pragmatism, like other anti-systematic and post-hegelian philosophies, renounces the search for an arche or foundation.
Anarchism thus appears as a general critique of dominant methods. An influential example is found in the work of Paul Feyerabend, whose counter-method provides an example of “theoretical anarchism” in epistemology and philosophy of science (Feyerabend 1975 [1993]). Feyerabend explains:
Science is an essentially anarchic enterprise: theoretical anarchism is more humanitarian and more likely to foster progress than its public order alternatives. (Feyerabend 1975 [1993: 9])
Their point is that science should not be limited by hierarchically imposed principles and strict compliance with the rule.
Post-structuralism and trends in postmodernism and continental philosophy can also be anarchists (see May 1994). The so-called “post-anarchism” is a decent and free-flowing discourse that deconstructs power, questions essentialism and undermines systems of authority. Following the deconstructive and critical work of authors such as Derrida, Deleuze, Foucault and others, this criticism of the arch goes down. If there is no arche or foundation, then we are left with a proliferation of possibilities. New trends in globalization, cyberspace and post-humanism complicate anarchist criticism of the “state”, as the traditional celebration of anarchism of freedom and autonomy can be critically examined and deconstructed (see Newman 2016).
Traditional anarchists were primarily interested in the sustained and focused political activism that led to the abolition of the state. The difference between post-anarchism free-flow and traditional anarchism can be seen in the realm of morality. Anarchism has traditionally been critical of centralized moral authority, but this criticism was often based on fundamental principles and traditional values, such as autonomy or freedom. But post-structuralism—along with the criticisms articulated by some feminists, theorists of the critical race and critics of Eurocentrism—questions these values and principles.",C2
"Although widely and commonly confused with republicanism, civic humanism forms a separate and distinct phenomenon in the history of Western political thought. Republicanism is a political philosophy that defends a concept of freedom as non-dominance, and identifies the institutions that protect it (Pettit 1999). In particular, republicanism opposes two alternative theories of politics. The first is despotism, especially as it manifests itself in any form of one-person government; a republic is self-governing, and so are its inhabitants. The second is liberalism, which postulates the primacy of the autonomous individual vis-à-vis public order and government; the Republican values civic commitment to realize a form of freedom achievable only in and through the community. Republican theorists sometimes refer to writings by historically antecedent authors, such as Aristotle or Machiavelli, but their concern is not primarily the exact interpretation. Rather, to the extent that they show interest in the past, it is as a source of ideas that they find useful.
On the contrary, civic humanism is a historiographical construction. As conventionally used by scholars, the term refers to a group of thinkers who emerged during the period of the Italian Renaissance, especially in Florence, and who were committed to public commitment (in theory as well as in practice) and whose values were fundamentally antithetical to the medieval past. The “invention” of civic humanism is mainly associated with Hans Baron (1900-1988), the famous German-American historian (Fubini 1992). Although he first used the phrase in its original German form (Bürgerhumanismus) as early as 1925, its popularity derives from the publication in 1955 of his classic book The Crisis of Early Italian Revival: Civic Humanism and Republican Freedom in an Age of Classicism and Tyranny (Revised 1966). In this volume, as well as in later writings that were based on it (many collected in Baron 1968 and 1988), he developed what has become called the “Thesis of Baron” (Witt 1996; Hankins 1995). Baron was not, however, the first scholar to propose the form of humanism that emerged during the 15th century in Italian cities mainly promoted active civic vit rather than literary and philological searches normally attributed to humanists. In two books from 1952 and 1954, written and published in Italian, Eugenio Garin defended a position almost identical to that of Baron: Renaissance humanism, especially as proposed in Florence, reflects a pronounced shift from the emphasis on the typical contemplation of the Middle Ages to the priority of civil action to achieve a common good (Garin 1947 [1965]). (If not for purely contingent reasons, the historiographic label for civic humanism could easily have been “the Garin thesis”). In the current context, it should be noted that some defenders of civic humanism were ready for republicanism, but the latter is not involved by the former.",C2
"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has called on Washington to resolve its finances after the U.S. would withdraw from the brink of debt default and hundreds of thousands of federal employees would return to work after a 16-day government shutdown.
As US President Barack Obama warned, “We have to get out of the habit of ruling by crisis,” IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde called for more stability.
“It will be essential to reduce uncertainty about the conduct of fiscal policy by raising the debt limit in a more lasting way,” he said.
“We also continue to encourage the United States to adopt a budget for 2014 and replace the hijacker with gradual measures that do not adversely affect recovery, and to adopt a balanced and comprehensive medium-term fiscal plan.”
A peace agreement drafted by the Senate that almost contained no concessions to the conservatives who had led the country to the precipice of a new financial crisis was approved by the Republican-dominated House of Representatives a few hours before a deadline to extend the US debt limit.
The World Bank also expressed its relief that the world economy “has dodged a potential catastrophe, ” with its president, Jim Yong Kim, urging policymakers in all countries to “continue to focus on developing and implementing policies that promote economic growth and boost employment and opportunities for all. ”
The stock markets in Japan, China, Hong Kong and South Korea initially reflected relief after Republicans finally capitulated in their failed attempt to undermine Obama’s health reforms. But, in Asia and Europe, stock markets in general showed a silent reaction, and traders apparently expect another battle in Washington in early 2014.
It is estimated that the closure cost 24 billion dollars, according to the rating agency Standard & Poor’s. China's official agency Xinhua News Agency had accused Washington of endangering the dollar assets of other countries. China is the largest creditor of the U.S. government.
Obama signed the necessary legislation to defend himself from non-compliance shortly after midnight Thursday after a Republican split in the House of Representatives. The bill had easily been passed with broad bipartisan support in the Senate, where Democratic and Republican leaders forged the agreement. It offers a temporary solution, financing the government until January 15 and raising the debt ceiling until February 7.
But the president made it clear that he did not expect another bitter struggle and closure of the budget in 2014.
In brief remarks in the White House shortly before the House vote, Obama said he expected the deal to “lift the cloud of uncertainty” he had hung over the country in recent weeks.
“Once this agreement reaches my desk, I will sign it immediately,” he said, in a statement issued at the White House. “I hope the next time isn’t in the eleventh hour. We have to get out of the habit of ruling because of the crisis.”
As he left the stand after his Wednesday night press conference, a journalist asked the president if the crisis would happen again in a few months. Speaking over his shoulder, Obama replied, “No.”
Earlier, Republican Senator Mike Lee had set a challenging tone, perhaps indicating more problems ahead: “The media keeps asking, ‘Was it worth it?’ My answer is, it is always worth doing the right thing.” He added, “This is not over.”
However, the political agreement was one of the worst possible results for Republicans. None of their stated goals were achieved and polls showed that voters overwhelmingly blamed them for the crisis.

"Valentine's Day (or Valentine's Day) is a feast that, in the United States, takes place on February 14, and technically means the achievements of Valentine's Day, a Roman saint of the third century.
With that said, most Americans, instead of honoring Valentine's through religious ceremony, enjoy the feast by participating in ""romantic"" behavior with their significant other or someone who wants to be their significant other; gifts, special dinners, and other affection recognitions include the Valentine's Day celebrations of most individuals.
Chocolates and flowers are commonly given as gifts during Valentine's Day, as well as the greeting cards they accompany (the greeting card companies launch new Valentine's Day designs annually). Red and pink are generally understood as ""the colors"" of Valentine's Day, and many individuals, instead of romantically celebrating, spend the holidays with their friends and/or family.
The variations of Valentine's Day are celebrated all over the world throughout the year. In the United States, the holiday, although recognized by the vast majority of the population, is not federally recognized; no time off is granted for Valentine's Day.",C2
"A promising place to begin to understand transcendental idealism is to look at the other philosophical positions from which Kant distinguishes him. In ""paralogism fourth"", it distinguishes transcendental idealism from transcendental realism:
This [transcendental] idealism is opposed to transcendental realism, which considers space and time as something given in itself (independent of our sensitivity). Therefore, the transcendental realistic represents the outward appearances (if their reality is recognized) as things in themselves [Dinge an sich selbst], which would exist independently of us and our sensibility and therefore would also be outside of us according to pure concepts of understanding. (A369)
Transcendental realism, according to this passage, is the view that objects in space and time exist independently of our experience of them, while transcendental idealism denies it. This point is reiterated later in the Critique when Kant writes:
We have sufficiently demonstrated in Transcendental Aesthetics that everything intuited in space or time, therefore all objects of a possible experience for us, are nothing but appearances, that is, mere representations, which, as they are represented, as extended beings or series of alterations, have no existence based on themselves outside our thoughts. I call this doctrine transcendental idealism. The realist, in transcendental significance, makes these modifications of our sensitivity in the things that remain in themselves, and therefore makes mere representations in things in themselves [Such a sich selbst]. (A491/B519)[3]
Appearances exist at least partly by virtue of our experience of them, while the existence of things in themselves is not based on our experience at all (cf. A369, A492/B521, A493/B522). Kant calls transcendental realism the ""common prejudice"" (A740/B768) and describes it as a ""common but fallacious presupposition"" (A536/B564; cf. Allison 2004: 22). Transcendental realism is the pre-theoretical view of common sense that objects in space and time are “things in themselves,” which Kant, of course, denies.
Kant also distinguishes transcendental idealism from another position he calls empirical idealism:
It would also do us an injustice if it were to attribute to us this long-deceased empirical idealism which, while assuming the very reality of space, denies the existence of beings spread in it, or at least finds this existence doubtful, and therefore in this sense admits no satisfactorily demonstrable distinction between dream and truth. As for the appearances of the inner sense in time, he finds no difficulty in them as real things, in fact, he even claims that this inner experience alone gives sufficient proof of the actual existence of his object (in itself) along with all this determination of time. (A491/B519)
Empirical idealism, as Kant characterizes it here, is the view that all we know immediately (not inferentially) is the existence of our own temporarily ordained minds and mental states, while we can only infer the existence of “outside” objects from us in space. Since the inference of an effect known to an unknown cause is always uncertain, the empirical idealist concludes that we cannot know that objects exist outside of us in space. Kant usually distinguishes two varieties of empirical idealism: dogmatic idealism, which affirms that objects in space do not exist, and problematic idealism, which affirms that objects in space may exist, but we cannot know if they do (see A377). Although never mentioned by name in edition A, Berkeley seems to be Kant's dogmatic idealist paradigm, while Descartes is named as the problematic idealist paradigm. [4]
Transcendental idealism is a form of empirical realism because it implies that we have an immediate (non-inferential) and true knowledge of the existence of objects in space merely through self-consciousness:
[...] external objects (bodies) are mere appearances, so there is nothing more than a sort of my representations, whose objects are something only through these representations, but are not separated from them. Thus, external things exist just as my self, and in fact both exist in the immediate testimony of my self-consciousness, only with this difference: the representation of my Self, as the thinking subject is merely related to the inner sense, but the representations that designate extended beings are also related to the external sense. I am no longer obliged to draw inferences with regard to the reality of external objects than with regard to the reality of my inner sense (my thoughts), because in both cases they are merely representations, the immediate perception (consciousness) of which is at the same time sufficient proof of their reality. (A370–1)
Only through self-conscious introspection can I know that I have representations with certain contents and since appearances are “no more than a sort of my representations” does this constitute an immediate and true knowledge of the existence of objects in space.
Understanding transcendental idealism requires understanding the precise meaning in which things themselves are, and appearances are not, “external” or “independent” of the mind and Kant makes a useful distinction between two senses in which objects can be “outside me”:
But since the expression outside of us carries with it an inevitable ambiguity, since it sometimes means something that, as a thing in itself [Ding a sich selbst], exists distinct from us and sometimes merely belongs to the outward appearance, then to escape from uncertainty and to use this concept in the latter meaning — in which it is taken in the appropriate psychological question about the reality of our outer intuition — we will distinguish the empirically external objects from those that could be called “outside” in the transcendental sense, calling them directly “things to be found in space”. (A373)
In the transcendental sense, an object is “outside of me” when its existence does not depend (or even partially) on my representations of it. The empirical sense of “outside me” depends on the distinction between external and internal meaning. The inner sense is the sensitive intuition of my inner states (which are in themselves appearances); time is the form of the inner sense, which means that all the states that we intuit internally are temporarily ordered. The external sense is the sensitive intuition of objects that are not my internal states; space is the form of the external sense. In the empirical sense, “out” refers simply to objects of outer sense, objects in space. Transcendental idealism is the view that objects in space are “external” in the empirical sense, but not in the transcendental sense. Things themselves are transcendentally “external” but appearances are not.",C2
"According to the United Nations, Syrian opposition forces may have executed up to 30 people, most of them Government soldiers, in the rural areas of Aleppo, who cited videos of the killings published on the Internet in July.
Navi Pillay, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, called the accusations deeply shocking and called on Friday for an independent investigation into the incident, which appears to have taken place in Khan al-Assal, in northern Syria.
A thorough independent investigation is needed to determine whether war crimes have been committed, and those responsible for such crimes must be brought to justice, Pillay said in a statement.
The videos, posted on the Internet between July 22 and 26, show government soldiers being ordered to lie down on the ground, bodies collected by doctors, bodies scattered along a wall and bodies in Khan al-Assal with gunshot wounds to the head.
Pillay's office also has information that Syrian rebels are still holding government officials and soldiers in prison, the statement said.
Reminding opposition forces that all captured or injured soldiers must be treated in accordance with international law, Pillay said, opposition forces should not think that they are immune from prosecution. They must fulfil their responsibilities under international law.
The UN. The International Independent Investigation Commission on the Syrian Arab Republic has previously stated that both rebel groups and government forces and their affiliated militias are demonstrating incipient patterns of summary executions and killings.
The news of the killings came when the Local Coordination Committees, an umbrella group of the opposition, said 19 of their loyalists had been killed, including two children. Most of the deaths occurred in Damascus, the LCC said.
In a speech to government forces on Thursday -- Army Foundation Day -- President Bashar al-Assad said he was confident that the government would triumph over the opposition, according to the Syrian Arab News Agency.
If in Syria we had not trusted victory, we would not have been able to stand firm and resist aggression for more than two years, said the president, according to SANA,
The United Nations human rights office also said on Friday that investigators have been allowed to visit rebel-controlled Khan al-Assal as part of a separate investigation into the alleged use of chemical weapons.
The rebels announced on Friday that they had written to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon requesting an investigation and demanding that anyone involved in the deployment of chemical weapons in Syria be held responsible for these crimes.
According to the United Nations, more than 100,000 people have died since the fighting began. Nearly 2 million have fled the country and 4 million more have been internally displaced.

"Europe will become the first place in the world to impose ‘real’ emission tests on car manufacturers, opening a new front in the fight against air pollution. New regulations will introduce tests to reveal what car emissions are like when driving on roads and in traffic rather than in ideal conditions, such as laboratory ones, as is currently the case.
Green illuminated by European Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans, the tests are designed to impose a limit of 80 mg nitrogen oxide per kilometer, a level reached by only one 16 car, according to researchers. Other countries, such as China and Korea, which are also considering emission testing in the real world, will be closely observing what will happen next.
Contaminants from diesel engines, such as nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and particulates, are believed to account for at least one quarter of the 29,000 pollution-related deaths per year in the United Kingdom. This figure is likely to increase when the committee on the medical effects of air pollutants publishes what it calls “stronger evidence” of public health damage caused by nitrogen oxide emissions at the end of 2015.
But the current laboratory test of the ""New European Cycle of Production"" to measure these emissions is a quarter of a century old and has been surpassed by technological advances in the automotive industry. Studies have shown that the results of laboratory techniques to measure automobile emissions can be easily fixed by using techniques such as door and window taping to minimize air resistance, driving on unrealistic smooth roads and testing at improbably high temperatures. Activists say car manufacturers also use tricks like programming vehicles to enter a low-emission mode when their front wheels rotate and their rear wheels are stationary, as is the case in such laboratory experiments.
“The Commission is finalizing a proposal to introduce a new emission test procedure that will allow a proper assessment of real-drive vehicles,” said Commission spokesperson Lucia Caudet. The proposal still needs the approval of other commissioners and a technical committee, but “we do not expect any major internal obstacles,” added a source from the European Union (EU).
“A key reason why air pollution kills 400,000 citizens a year is that car manufacturers cheat tests for diesel cars, causing many times more pollution on the road,” said Greg Archer, Clean Vehicle Manager for Transport and Environment. “The development of a new engine emission test in the real world is an important step forward in the fight against urban air pollution. The EU states should now support the Commission's proposals and ignore the complaint by car manufacturers that the rules are too strict.""
According to research by the International Clean Transport Council in 2014, actual emissions of nitrogen oxide from cars are seven times higher than the 80mg/km standard, and some models operate 22 times above the recommended limit. Only a 16-year-old car hit the 80g target. About one third of all nitrogen oxide pollution comes from road transport – mostly diesel – and, in urban areas, concentrations can reach 64%, the figures from the European Environment Agency indicate.
Activists say the automotive industry has tried to delay reforms to auto testing cycles, but industrial groups deny it, arguing that a five-year period is necessary for technical and economic reasons. “Real driving emissions (RDE) is an entirely new regulation that will force significant changes in the emission control hardware that can be demanded in the midst of a vehicle’s production life,” said Cara McLaughlin, spokesperson for the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA). “However, ACEA fully accepts that RDE will apply to new types of cars as of September 2017.”
In an unusual move, the automobile association sent Timmermans a draft own regulation for him to consider, after EU representatives finally agreed on a regulation to implement nitrogen oxide limits with reinforced road testing and strict control of exhaust gases. The draft ACEA Regulation would have covered less pollutants and further delayed the gradual introduction of the Regulation until 2020. The test distances would have been reduced from 1,300m to less than 700m, the minimum temperatures would have been raised from -7C to -3C and more rural roads would have been used. The lobbyists were all over this, Archer said. “This was a real attempt to subvert the legislative process.”
Following Timmerman's apparent rejection of the ACEA proposal, the regulation will now be passed to the rubber seal commissioners, and to the Member States for the final amendments, before an introduction scheduled for September. By 2017, the first real-world car emissions tests are expected to start seriously. A similar battle already looming over the testing of CO2 emissions for cars by the end of 2015 – and with comparable discussions in other countries – will closely follow the introduction of new EU emission tests.

"Brazil experienced one of its biggest nights of protest in decades, when more than 100,000 people took to the streets across the country to express their frustration at the heavy police work, poor public services and high costs for the World Cup.
Major demonstrations in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Brasilia, Belem, Belo Horizonte, Salvador and elsewhere began peacefully, but several led to clashes with police and arson attacks on cars and buses.
The large turnout and geographical dispersion marked a rapid escalation after earlier smaller protests against the rise in bus prices, causing complaints that the police responded disproportionately with rubber bullets, tear gas and violent blows.
Coinciding with the start of the Confederations Cup – a World Cup test event – the rallies brought together a broad coalition of frustrated people with rising costs and persistent poor quality of public services, luxurious investment in international sporting events, low standards of health care, and broader unrest about inequality and corruption.
Although the vast majority of the demonstrations in Rio were peaceful, several police officers were injured in clashes at the city's legislative assembly, at least one car was overturned and burned, and windows were broken in the offices of banks and notarial offices.
The riots intensified during the night when a large crowd set fire to several fires outside the legislative assembly, smashed the windows of the building and painted graffiti on the walls proclaiming “Revolution”, “Down Paes, Down Cabral [the mayor and governor of the state]” and “Police of Hate.” The police inside responded with pepper spray and perhaps more – the Guardian saw a fainting protestor and bleeding heavily from a wound to the upper arm.
The causes pursued by the protesters varied widely. “We are here because we hate the government. They don’t do anything for us,” said Oscar José Santos, a 19-year-old who was with a group of hooded youth from the Rocinha favela.
“I’m an architect, but I’ve been unemployed for six months. There must be something wrong with this country,” said Nadia to the Husin, raising a banner asking the government to do more for education.
In a much smaller demonstration in Brasilia, protesters crossed police lines to enter the high security area of the national congress. Several went up to the roof.
In Belo Horizonte, police confronted protesters who tried to break a cordon around a football stadium that hosted a Confederations Cup match between Nigeria and Tahiti.
In Porto Alegre, protesters set fire to a bus and, in Curitiba, protesters tried to break into the state governor's office. There were also rallies in Belem, Salvador and elsewhere.
In São Paulo, which had witnessed the fiercest clashes of the previous week and the main allegations of police violence, large crowds gathered once again, but initial reports suggested that the marches had passed peacefully.
Reflecting the importance of social media to spread the message about the protests, some in São Paulo – where the figures were estimated to be between 30,000 and 100,000 – carried banners declaring “We came from Facebook.”
Most of the protesters were young and, for many, it was their first experience of such a giant demonstration. “My generation has never experienced this,” said Thiago Firbida, a student. “Since the dictatorship, Brazilians have never bothered to take to the streets. They didn't think they had a reason to. But now Brazil is again in crisis, with a steady rise in prices, so people are finally reacting.”
Comparisons have been made with rallies in Turkey and elsewhere. Another global link was evident in the handful of protesters wearing Guy Fawkes masks, associated with the Anonymous and Occupy Wall Street protests.
Brazilian demonstrations are called the “wine revolution” (after police arrested people for bringing vinegar to counter tear gas), as well as the “twenty cent revolution” (due to the rise in bus prices) and the Passe Livre (after demand for free public transportation).
Some said the protests felt unBrazilian but liberating. “Our politicians need to see the strength we have as one people. Brazilians tend to be too nice sometimes – they enjoy the party instead of protesting – but something is changing,” said Deli Borsari, a 53-year-old yoga instructor.
After extensive coverage of the costs of the new and renewed stadiums, the Confederations Cup football tournament has been one of the focus of the protests. Before the inaugural party in Brasilia, crowds of protesters were dispersed by riot police. The shooting showed frightened Japanese followers running out of the area holding their children, while the sound of the shooting was heard, perhaps rubber bullets or tear gas.
Another protest march, near the Maracana Stadium in Rio, received an equally heavy police response.
Most of the demonstrations appeared to begin peacefully until they confronted the security forces, which are largely organized at the regional level. President Dilma Rousseff approves of the protests, according to her assistants. “The president believes that peaceful protests are legitimate and appropriate for a democracy, and that it is natural for young people to demonstrate,” said Helena Chagas, from the president’s office.
However, the president was booed at the opening ceremony of the Confederations Cup. With the economy in bad shape and the social unrest on the rise, it faces a serious political challenge, both now and in 2014, when Brazil will not only host the World Cup, but will also have a presidential election.

"The classic Sorites, or ""heavy argument"", seeks to show that even 10,000 grains do not make a lot, on the ground that (a) three grains do not make, and (b) the addition of a grain could never be enough to turn a non-heavy into a pile: however, often one grain is added further, there is no exact limit between the non-heavy and the pile. The applications of this form of argument were widespread in the Hellenistic era, and the logical stoic Crisipus wrote many books trying to solve it. Diodoro is a likely source or inspiration for this Hellenistic concern (see previous paragraph).
Soritas are a particularly lethal weapon when used in the field of semantics, threatening to erase the limits on which rigid definitions depend. It may therefore be relevant that Diodorus has proposed his own semantic theory (Aulus Gellus, Attic Nights 11.12.1-3; cf. 1 above, the story of his change of name to his slave, reported by Ammon, In the interpretation of Aristotle 38.17-20. This was based on the ‘conventionalist’ thesis expressed by the character Hermogenes in Plato’s Cratylus, according to which nothing but convention — whether national, local or simply private — determines the meaning of a word, and any convenient string of sounds can in principle be used to convey any meaning. Diodorus' inference of this was that the only determinant of the meaning of a word is the intention of the one who utters it on any occasion in which it is used. He continued to imply that there are no real ambiguities: given the assumption that a word is pronounced on each occasion with a specific meaning in mind, a word has only one meaning at any time.
One may wonder whether this semantic theory, which reduced the meaning to the meaning of professing, was designed to remedy the kind of harm the soritas threatened. If meanings are purely determined by the speaker's intention on each occasion, a radical reconsideration of the definitional theory appears in any case to be necessary. And it may be that counting the grains becomes simply irrelevant to determining what constitutes a lot.
Diodorus was also closely associated with the paradox ""Veiled"" (Diogenes Laertius, 2,111; Lucian, Sale of Life, 22-3): you know who your father is; you don't know who the man veiled there is; but that man veiled is your father; so they both do and don't know who their father is. We could guess that Diodoro's own solution has once again been semantic. In each of its occurrences ‘knowing’ has, in the mind of the defendant, a distinct meaning appropriate to the case (knowledge, recognition), and therefore there is no contradiction.",C2
"The spread of light in the vicinity of compact astrophysic objects, such as neutron stars and black holes, is affected by the gravitational field. It has been shown that general relativistic effects could be important in understanding the characteristics of radiation.

"Europe’s forests – and suburbs – are resounding with the grunts, howls, and silent padding of large predators, according to a new study showing that brown bears, wolves, and lynxes are thriving on a crowded continent. Despite fears that large carnivores are doomed to extinction due to increased human populations and excessive consumption, a study published in Science has found that populations of large predators are stable or increasing in Europe.
Brown bears, wolves, Eurasian lynx and worms are found in almost one third of continental Europe (excluding Belarus, Ukraine and Russia), and most people live outside natural reserves, indicating that changing attitudes and landscape-scale conservation measures successfully protect species that have suffered massive persecution throughout human history.
Bears are the most abundant large carnivores in Europe, with about 17,000 individuals, along with 12,000 wolves, 9,000 Eurasian lynxes and 1,250 wolves, which are restricted to the northern parts of Scandinavia and Finland. Only Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, like Britain, have no breeding populations of at least one large carnivorous species. But the main author of the newspaper and other conservationists said that the surprising distribution of these animals in well-populated regions of Europe showed that even the British countryside could support large predators.
Guillaume Chapron of the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences and researchers from all over Europe found wolves, in some cases, living in suburban areas along with up to 3,050 people per square kilometer, more than the population density of Cambridge or Newcastle. On average in Europe, wolves live on land with a population density of 37 people per km2, lynx in areas with a population density of 21 people per km2 and bears among 19 people per km2. The Highlands population density is nine people per km2.
“To have wolves, we don’t need to get people out of the landscape,” Chapron said. According to Chapron and his colleagues, the revival of large carnivores shows the success of a conservation model based on “land sharing”, in stark contrast to keeping predators and people separate by surrounding “unknown” areas, as is the case in North America and Africa.
“I’m not saying it’s a story of peace and love – coexistence often means conflict – but it’s important to manage that conflict, keep it low and solve the problems it causes. Wolves can be difficult neighbors,” Chapron said. “We should not talk about conflicts between people and predators; we have conflicts between people over predators. These animals are symbolic of difficult questions about how we should use the land.”
According to researchers, this “share land” approach could be applied in other parts of the world. Among the reasons for its success in Europe are political stability, the flourishing of dam populations such as wild deer and financial support for the protection of non-lethal livestock, such as electric fences, which means that farmers do not resort to wild predator hunts. The most crucial thing, Chapron said, has been the EU Habitats Directive, which has forced Member States to protect and revive rare species.
“Without the Habitats Directive, I don’t think we would have had this recovery,” he said. “It shows that if people are willing to protect nature and if political will translates into strong legislation such as the Habitats Directive, it is possible to achieve results in the protection of wildlife.” The revival was welcomed by author and commentator George Monbiot, who is launching Rewilding Britain, a new charity to encourage the return of the wild landscape and extinct species.
“It’s great to see that the upward trend continues, but Britain is completely anomalous – we’ve lost more of our great mammals than any other country except Ireland,” he said. “Apart from the accidental reintroduction of the boar, we have done almost nothing, while, in much of the rest of Europe, we have bears, lynx and wolves coming back. It is a massive change of the centuries of persecution.”
The survey found that the Eurasian lynx lives permanently in 11 population groups in 23 European countries, of which only five were native populations, indicating the success of reintroduction efforts. According to Monbiot, the momentum is increasing for the reintroduction of the lynx into the Cairngorms in Scotland.
“If it works in the rest of Europe, there is absolutely no reason why it can’t work in the UK,” he said, noting that bears and wolves are found an hour from Rome. “There is no demographic reason why we cannot have a similar return to wildlife in the UK.”",C2
"Hedging funds are once again becoming bullish in oil, betting on the pandemic and the environmental approach of investors has seriously damaged the ability of companies to increase production.
The opinion is an investment for hedge funds, which shortened the oil sector in the run-up to global closures, landing revenues from energy-centered hedge funds of 26.8% in 2020, according to eVestment data. Under their quick-moving strategies, hedge funds are quick to detect new trends.
The global benchmark for Brent oil has jumped by 59% since early November, when news of successful vaccines emerged, after last year's COVID-19 slowed down and blocked fuel demand and collapsed oil prices. Last week it reached prepandemic levels close to $60 a barrel.
U.S. crude oil has risen 54% to about $57 per barrel during the same period.
“By summer, the vaccine should be provided widely and just in time for summer trips, and I think things are going to be wrong,” said David D. Tawil, co-founder of the New York-based hedge fund, Maglan Capital, and acting CEO of Centaurus Energy.
Tawil predicted prices from $70 to $80 a barrel for Brent at the end of 2021 and is investing for a long time independent oil and gas producers.
Hedge Funds' bullish bets come despite the International Energy Agency's warning in January that an increase in new coronavirus cases will hamper oil demand this year, and a slow economic recovery would delay a total upturn in global energy demand until 2025.
Normally, oil producers would increase production as prices increased, but the shift of environmental-focused investors from fossil fuels to renewable energies and the caution of lenders leaves them under heavy pressure to respond, say hedge funds and other investors.
The rate of recovery of production in the United States, No. 1 oil producer is expected to be slow and will not exceed its record of 12.25 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2019 until 2023. Production in 2020 fell by 6.4% to 11.47 million bpd.
However, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which has also reviewed demand growth, still expects production reductions to maintain the market deficit for 2021.
According to Rystad Energy, global crude and condensed production declined by 8 per cent in December from February 2020, before the spread of the pandemic accelerated.
North American output declined by 9.5 per cent and that of Europe decreased by only 1 per cent during the same period.
The US sanctions against Venezuela and the decline in oil fields in Mexico have slowed Latin American oil production.
Some banks are predicting that the United States, leading to the number of COVID-19 cases, will achieve immunity from herds by July, which would greatly stimulate oil demand, said Jean-Louis Le Mee, director of the Westbeck Capital Management hedge fund, which is a long mix of future oil and stock.
“The oil companies, for the first time in a long time, are prone to make a big comeback,” he said. “We have all the ingredients for an extraordinary market of bulls in oil for the coming years.”
In the United States, hedge funds increased their allocation to Exxon Mobil Corp by 21,314 shares in the third quarter, showing the most recent presentations in the United States compiled by Symmetric.io.
Hedge's funds added another 9,070 shares of the largest Americans ConocoPhillips and 4,144 to Chevron Corp during the same period.
In other places, short-circuit activity in BP PLC fell by 16 million shares on February 4, but slightly increased in the largest European oil company Royal Dutch Shell Plc by 1.9 million shares, according to data from Astec Analytics of the FIS.
Some investors remain sceptical about Canadian oil companies, among the world's most carbon-intensive producers, although they are bouncing faster than the United States.
Current short positions increased by 10 out of 14 Canadian oil companies in Toronto's energy index during the second two weeks of January, according to Reuters' revised submissions.
U.S. shale production will not recover quickly, given the required capital and debt producers are carrying, supporting oil prices, said Rafi Tahmazian, senior portfolio manager at Canoe Financial LP based in Calgary.
The North American oilfield services sector, in which producers rely to drill new wells, has been decimated, he said.
“They are beheaded of being able to grow,” Tahmazian said. The side of the offer is broken.",C2
"Without further heating, radiative gas cooling in the halos of massive galaxies (Milky Way and above) produces cold gas or stars in excess of what is observed. Previous works suggested that AGN jets are probably required, but the form of jet energy required to shut down remains unclear. This is particularly difficult for galaxy simulations, in which resolution is orders of magnitude thicker than necessary to form and evolve the jet. In such scales, uncertain parameters include: jet energy form (kinetic, thermal and cosmic ray energy (CR), energy, impulse and mass flow, force and geometry of the magnetic field, angle and precession period of the jet, opening angle and work cycle. We investigate all these parameters in a 1014M® halo using high resolution non-cosmological MHD simulations with the FIRE-2 (Feedback In Realistic Environments) star feedback model, driving and viscosity. We explore what scenarios coincide with observational constraints and demonstrate that RC-dominated jets can more efficiently shut down the central galaxy through a combination of CR pressure support and a modification of thermal instability. Jets with most of the energy in the work of thermal plasma slightly relativistic (meV or 1010 K), but require a larger 10 factor energy input. For a fixed energy flow, jets with more specific energy (longer cooling times) are turned off more effectively. For this halo size, kinetic jets are less efficient in cooling unless they have wide opening or precession angles. Magnetic fields play a minor role except when the magnetic flow reaches 1044 erg s−1 in a kinetic jet model, which makes the jet cocoon expand significantly, and cooling becomes explosive. We conclude that the criteria for a successful jet model are an optimal energy flow and a sufficiently wide jet cocoon with sufficient cooling time in the cooling radius.",C2
